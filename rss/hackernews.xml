<description>&lt;p&gt;U.S. securities regulators on Tuesday sued cryptocurrency giant Ripple, and both its CEO and executive chairman, for allegedly selling over $1.3 billion in unregistered securities. Ripple on Monday had publicly disclosed that the lawsuit was to be filed imminently, and said it does not believe its tokens needed to be registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; XRP, the cryptocurrency created by Ripple in 2012, has the crypto industry's third-largest market cap at around $22 billion, behind only Bitcoin and Ether.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SEC charges Ripple and two executives</title>
<link>https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Washington D.C., Dec. 22, 2020 —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;99&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed an action against Ripple Labs Inc. and two of its executives, who are also significant security holders, alleging that they raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the SEC's complaint, Ripple; Christian Larsen, the company's co-founder, executive chairman of its board, and former CEO; and Bradley Garlinghouse, the company's current CEO, raised capital to finance the company's business. The complaint alleges that Ripple raised funds, beginning in 2013, through the sale of digital assets known as XRP in an unregistered securities offering to investors in the U.S. and worldwide. Ripple also allegedly distributed billions of XRP in exchange for non-cash consideration, such as labor and market-making services. According to the complaint, in addition to structuring and promoting the XRP sales used to finance the company's business, Larsen and Garlinghouse also effected personal unregistered sales of XRP totaling approximately $600 million. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to register their offers and sales of XRP or satisfy any exemption from registration, in violation of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Issuers seeking the benefits of a public offering, including access to retail investors, broad distribution and a secondary trading market, must comply with the federal securities laws that require registration of offerings unless an exemption from registration applies,&quot; said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. &quot;We allege that Ripple, Larsen, and Garlinghouse failed to register their ongoing offer and sale of billions of XRP to retail investors, which deprived potential purchasers of adequate disclosures about XRP and Ripple's business and other important long-standing protections that are fundamental to our robust public market system.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The registration requirements are designed to ensure that potential investors – including, importantly, retail investors – receive important information about an issuer's business operations and financial condition,&quot; said Marc P. Berger, Deputy Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. &quot;Here, we allege that Ripple and its executives failed over a period of years to satisfy these core investor protection provisions, and as a result investors lacked information to which they were entitled.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC's complaint, filed today in federal district court in Manhattan, charges defendants with violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC's investigation was conducted by Daphna A. Waxman, Jon A. Daniels, and John O. Enright of the SEC's Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by Kristina Littman, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The SEC's litigation will be conducted by Jorge G. Tenreiro, Dugan Bliss, Ms. Waxman, and Mr. Daniels, and supervised by Preethi Krishnamurthy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SEC Approves NYSE’s Plan for New IPO Alternative</title>
<link>https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-approves-nyses-plan-for-new-ipo-alternative-11608665152</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-approves-nyses-plan-for-new-ipo-alternative-11608665152</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission will allow companies to raise capital through direct listings, opening the door to a new alternative to the traditional initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC approved the new kind of direct listing—which could help startups save on bank fees and capture more of the gains in their share price when they go public—in an order posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2020/34-90768.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;on its website Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was a victory for the New York Stock Exchange, which had been seeking to change its rulebook to make the new process &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyses-plan-for-new-ipo-alternative-wins-green-light-from-sec-11598479804?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;available to companies going public&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission rejected arguments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyse-direct-listings-hit-snag-as-investor-group-raises-concerns-11599000009?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;by an influential trade group&lt;/a&gt;, the Council of Institutional Investors, that had sought to block the NYSE’s plan from taking effect. The council had warned that the new kind of direct-listing process would circumvent the investor protections of traditional IPOs, and it petitioned the SEC’s commissioners to review the NYSE’s proposal after staffers at the commission gave it an initial green light in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a direct listing, a company floats its shares on a stock exchange, but without hiring banks to underwrite the transaction like in an IPO. Until now, companies have only been allowed to use direct listings to sell existing shares, which means their founders and early investors could cash out of their stakes, but the company couldn’t raise new capital. That has limited the process to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantirs-and-asanas-dueling-ipos-to-test-direct-listing-process-nyse-11601402163?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;a small number of cash-rich companies&lt;/a&gt; such as Palantir Technologies Inc., which went public &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-asana-direct-listing-ipo-11601479305?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;via a direct listing in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How a janitor at Frito-Lay invented Flamin&amp;#039; Hot Cheetos</title>
<link>https://thehustle.co/hot-cheetos-inventor/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thehustle.co/hot-cheetos-inventor/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On an early morning in the late 1980s, a group of the highest-powered executives at Frito-Lay — the CEO, CMO, and a platoon of VPs — gathered in a California conference room to hear what Richard Montañez had to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez didn’t share their pedigree. He wasn’t an executive. He had no fancy degree. He had a 4th-grade-level education, and couldn’t read or write.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez was a janitor. But he was a janitor with an idea — an idea that would make the company billions of dollars and become one of history’s most celebrated and iconic snack foods: Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But first, he had to convince the world to hear him out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking grapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez grew up in the 1960s in Guasti, California, a tiny unincorporated farming town 40 miles east of Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the sweltering Cucamonga Valley sun, his family — mother, father, grandfather, and 11 children — scraped together a meager living picking grapes, and slept together in a one-room cinderblock abode at the labor camp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a first-generation Mexican immigrant at an all-white school, Montañez had access to few resources and struggled to understand his teachers. “I remember my mom getting me ready for school and I was crying,” he later told&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowrider.com/news/1108-lmrp-richard-montanez-raza-report/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lowrider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;magazine. “I couldn’t speak English.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One day in class, the teacher went around the room asking each kid to name his or her dream job:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctor… astronaut… veterinarian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;When she called on Montañez, he froze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I realized I didn’t have a dream,” he says. “There was no dream where I came from.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez soon stopped getting on the school bus and began boarding the work truck with his father and grandfather.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Burrito-Cookie-Richard-Montanez/dp/1622957911&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;dropping out of school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, he worked the fields in 110&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;°F heat and took on odd jobs slaughtering chickens at a poultry factory, washing cars, and picking weeds. With a 4th-grade-level education and few economic opportunities,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Montañez saw no path out of poverty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, in 1976, a neighbor told him about a job opening that would change his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There’s no such thing as ‘just a janitor’”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Down the road, in Rancho Cucamonga, the Frito-Lay plant was looking for a janitor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At $4 per hour ($18 in 2019 dollars), the job paid many multiples of what Montañez made in the fields. It represented a better life — insurance, benefits, social mobility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unable to read or write, the 18-year-old recruited his wife to help fill out an application. He journeyed down a dusty road, met with the hiring manager, and got the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When he broke the news to his family, his grandfather imparted a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/video/wkno-conversation-conversation-richard-montanez/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;piece of advice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that would always stick with him: “Make sure that floor shines,” the man told his grandson. “And let them know that a Montañez mopped it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez decided he was going to be the “best janitor Frito-Lay had ever seen” — and he quickly made his presence known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Every time someone walked into a room, it would smell fresh,” he says. “I realized there’s no such thing as ‘just a janitor’ when you believe you’re going to be the best.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1583&quot; data-src=&quot;https://thehustleco.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/plant.jpg&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14425 lazyload&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14425&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustleco.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/plant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1583&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;The Frito-Lay plant in Bakersfield, California (via CLUI)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez also developed the philosophy that “it’s not about who you know — it’s about who knows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In between shifts, he set out to make himself seen, learning as much as he could about the company’s products, spending time in the warehouse, and watching the machines churn out crunchy snacks in the lonely midnight hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And eventually, his insatiable curiosity would pay off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I saw no products catering to Latinos”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the mid-1980s, Frito-Lay had fallen on tough times. As a way to boost morale, then-CEO Roger Enrico recorded a video message and disseminated it to the company’s 300k employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the video, Enrico encouraged every worker at the company to “act like an owner.” Most employees brushed it off as a management cliché; Montañez took it to heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Here’s my invitation… here’s the CEO telling me, the janitor, that I can act like an owner,” he later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D6nfezrVV4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recalled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “I didn’t know what I was going to do. Didn’t need to. But I knew I was going to act like an owner.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After nearly a decade mopping floors, Montañez gathered the courage to ask one of the Frito-Lay salesmen if he could tag along and learn more about the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They went to a convenience store in a Latino neighborhood — and while the salesman restocked inventory, Montañez made a fortuitous observation: “I saw our products on the shelves and they were all plain: Lay’s, Fritos, Ruffles,” he recalls. “And right next to these chips happened to be a shelf of Mexican spices.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In that moment, he realized that Frito-Lay had “nothing spicy or hot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks later, Montañez stopped at a local vendor to get some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenoshery.com/elote-corn-mexican-street-corn/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;elote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Mexican “street corn” doused in chili powder, salt, cotija, lime juice, and crema fresca. Cob in hand, a “revelation” struck:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if I put chili on a Cheeto?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1629&quot; data-src=&quot;https://thehustleco.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/elote.jpg&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14426 lazyload&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14426&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustleco.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/elote.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1629&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;Elote, the Mexican corn treat that inspired Flamin’ Hot Cheetos (via Vallarta Supermarkets)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduced to the world in 1948,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetos&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheetos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;— crunchy corn-based nuggets coated in cheese-flavored powder — were a flagship product of Frito-Lay. And while they were popular among California’s growing base of Latino consumers, the company had yet to consider re-tailoring the product’s taste profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Nobody had given any thought to the Latino market,” recalls Montañez. “But everywhere I looked, I saw it ready to explode.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, Montañez heeded the CEO’s words and “acted like an owner.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working late one night at the production facility, he scooped up some Cheetos that hadn’t yet been dusted in cheese. He took them home and, with the help of his wife, covered them in his own concoction of chili powder and other “secret” spices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When he handed them out to family members and friends, the snacks were met with universal enthusiasm. He just needed a bigger audience…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So he called the CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was naive,” Montañez later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/video/wkno-conversation-conversation-richard-montanez/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “I didn’t know you weren’t supposed to call the CEO… I didn’t know the rules.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finding Roger Enrico’s phone number was easy enough: It was listed in a company directory. He rang the line, and was put through to the chief’s executive assistant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Mr. Enrico’s office. Who is this?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Richard Montañez.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What division are you with?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“California.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re the VP overseeing California?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No, I work at the Rancho Cucamonga plant.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oh, so you’re the VP of operations?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No, I work inside the plant.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re the plant manager?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No. I’m the janitor.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The assistant paused for what seemed like an eternity. “One moment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;Richard Montañez (via Twitter)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, a voice on the other line: “Hello, this is Roger.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez told the CEO he’d heeded the call to action. He’d studied the company’s products, identified a demand in the market, and even crafted his own rudimentary snacks in his kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enrico loved the ingenuity: He told the janitor he’d be at the plant in 2 weeks and asked him to prepare a presentation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moments after Montañez hung up the phone, the plant manager stormed up to him. “He said, ‘Who do you think you are? Who let the janitor call the CEO?’” recalls Montañez. “Then he said, ‘YOU’RE doing this presentation!’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The birth of the Hot Cheeto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez was 26 years old. In his words, he couldn’t read or write very well and had no knowledge about how to formulate a business proposal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But he wasn’t about to give up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Accompanied by his wife, he went to the library, found a book on marketing strategies, and copied the first 5 paragraphs word for word onto&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIH4pFUxu9s&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;transparencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. At home, he filled 100 plastic baggies with his homemade treats, sealed them with a clothing iron, and manually drew a logo and design on each package.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the day of the presentation, he bought a $3 tie — black with blue and red stripes — and had his neighbor knot it for him. As he gathered the bags, his wife stopped him near the door: “Don’t forget who you are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14430&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustleco.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hot-cheetos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;1700&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;Hot Cheetos in action (Frito-Lay)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montañez stepped into the boardroom. “Here I was,” he says, “a janitor presenting to some of the most highly qualified executives in America.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At one point during the presentation, an executive in the room interjected: “How much market share do you think you can get?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It hit me that I had no idea what he was talking about, or what I was doing,” Montañez&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowrider.com/news/1108-lmrp-richard-montanez-raza-report/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recalled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “I was shaking, and I damn near wanted to pass out…[but] I opened my arms and I said, ‘This much market share!’ I didn’t even know how ridiculous that looked.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The room went silent as the CEO stood up and smiled. “Ladies and gentlemen, do you realize we have an opportunity to go after this much market share?” he said, stretching out his arms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He turned to Montañez. “Put that mop away, you’re coming with us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling hot, hot, hot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Six months later, with Montañez’s help, Frito-Lay began testing Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in small Latino markets in East Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it performed well, the company would move forward with the product; if it didn’t, they’d scratch it — and Montañez would likely return to janitorial duties. This was his one shot, and some folks didn’t want things to work out for him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It seemed there was a group of [executives] who wanted it to fail,” he later told the podcast,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-passionate-few/id1162369953?i=1000392815979&amp;amp;mt=2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Passionate Few&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “They thought I got lucky. They were paid big bucks to come up with these ideas… they didn’t want some janitor to do it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;2104&quot; data-src=&quot;https://thehustleco.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cheeto-sign.jpg&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14431 lazyload&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14431&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustleco.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cheeto-sign.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;2104&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;Montañez signs a young fan’s Hot Cheeto bag (@daliaabbas9, via Deskgram)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So Montañez assembled a small team of family members and friends, went to the test markets, and bought every bag of Hot Cheetos he could find.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’d tell the owner, ‘Man, these are great,’” he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-passionate-few/id1162369953?i=1000392815979&amp;amp;mt=2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;recalled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Next week, I’d come back and there’d be a whole rack.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1992, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos were greenlit for a national release. And in short order, the snack became one of the most successful product launches in Frito-Lay history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From janitor to VP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos are one of Frito-Lay’s hottest-selling commodities — a multi-billion-dollar snack celebrated by everyone from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2014/WRN/103114-katy-perry-594.jpg?itok=HXYMvo1V&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/03/26/395598079/guess-what-makes-the-cut-as-a-smart-snack-in-schools-hot-cheetos&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;middle-schoolers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on meal vouchers. There’s even a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLy4j8EZIk&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rap song&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And Montañez is no longer sweeping floors: Over a 35-year career, the former janitor rose through the corporate ranks and is now the vice president of multicultural sales for PepsiCo America (the holding company of Frito-Lay).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before Montañez joined the executive team, Frito-Lay had only 3 Cheeto products; since then, the company has launched&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timelinemaker.com/blog/featured-timeline/history-of-cheetos-timeline/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;more than 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, each worth $300m+.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recognized by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Newsweek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;as one of the most influential Hispanic leaders in America, Montañez is a gifted speaker who often tours the country giving&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D6nfezrVV4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;keynotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And soon, his story will hit the silver screen: Fox Searchlight Pictures is currently&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://alumni.harvard.edu/events/flamin-hot-cheetos&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;working on a biopic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about his life, appropriately titled “Flamin’ Hot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He still lives in Rancho Cucamonga, where he gives back to his community through a nonprofit he launched and teaches MBA classes at a nearby college.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recently, a student asked him how he was teaching without a Ph.D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I do have a Ph.D.,” he responded. “I’ve been poor, hungry and determined.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WiFi 6 gets 1.34 Gbps on the Raspberry Pi CM4</title>
<link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/wifi-6-gets-134-gbps-on-raspberry-pi-cm4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/wifi-6-gets-134-gbps-on-raspberry-pi-cm4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/edup-in-raspberry-pi-wifi-6-compute-module-4-pcie-io-board.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;EDUP Intel AX200 WiFi 6 802.11ax PCIe card in Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buying three wireless cards, a new WiFi router, optimizing my process for cross-compiling the Linux kernel for the Raspberry Pi, installing Intel's WiFi firmware, and patching Intel's wireless driver to make it work on the Raspberry Pi, I benchmarked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3prkSk3&quot;&gt;EDUP Intel AX200 WiFi 6 PCIe card&lt;/a&gt; and got &lt;strong&gt;1.34 Gbps of bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt; between the Raspberry Pi and a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3re0KDy&quot;&gt;ASUS WiFi 6 router&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The never-ending budget-busting project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever started a project that should take a couple hours with a fifty dollar budget, and realized at the end you spent a whole month on it and spent close to a thousand bucks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, well, this is one of those projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-cm4-built-in-wifi-ac.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi Built-in WiFi module 802.11ac Compute Module 4&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tested the Compute Module 4's onboard WiFi 802.11ac chip, I got up to around 80 Mbps, even when using an external antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/asus-ac51-wifi-pcie-ac-card.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;ASUS AC51 Wireless WiFi 802.11ac PCIe card&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered if I could get better performance with a PCI express card. So I bought an &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3ldzLVn&quot;&gt;ASUS AC51 PCIe card&lt;/a&gt; that has a Realtek chip inside, and I spent a few days debugging Realtek's Linux drivers. Eventually, though, I gave up, because most people on Linux seem use a USB version, not PCI express. If you want to read more about that failure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/20&quot;&gt;check out this GitHub issue on the ASUS AC51&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after a little more research on well-supported WiFi chipsets on Linux, I settled on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3ar3Pu3&quot;&gt;EDUP Intel AX200 PCIe card&lt;/a&gt; pictured at the top of this post. From what I read online, the &lt;code&gt;iwlwifi&lt;/code&gt; drivers it requires are used a lot more widely, in a variety of desktops and laptops running Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Video with extra details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post continues below, but if you're more visually-inclined, I also posted this video about WiFi 6 on the Pi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/csI19aOJEik&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the thumbnail—it performs a thousand times better than not-open-mouthed-Jeff in my A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's AX? What happened to AC?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we get to the card, what's 802.11ax and what's WiFi 6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/airport-graphite-original-wifi-router.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Apple AirPort WiFi Router&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WiFi's early days, when Apple's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPort#AirPort_Base_Station&quot;&gt;AirPort&lt;/a&gt; was all the rage, and we had 802.11b WiFi, with a theoretical maximum speed of 11 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past couple decades, we had 802.11a and g with 54 Mbps, 802.11n (AKA WiFi 4) with 300-600 Mbps and using either the 2.4 or 5 gigahertz spectrum, and more recently, 802.11ac (AKA WiFi 5) with up to 1.3 Gbps on the 5 gigahertz band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/wifi-bandwidth-standards.png&quot; alt=&quot;WiFi bandwidth history 2000-2020&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other standards I'm skipping over, but last year the 802.11ax standard was christened as 'WiFi 6', and it's now the gold standard, allowing a theoretical maximum of 10 Gbps over the 5 gigahertz band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the card to work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to the PCI express card. It fits nicely in the 1x slot on the Compute Module 4 IO board without the need for any adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I do with all the boards I test is boot the Pi and see what I can see using &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo lspci -vvv
...
01:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Device 2723 (rev 1a)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the board showed up, I also ran &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; and looked for the PCI express initialization section, to make sure there weren't any BAR space issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[    0.940759] pci 0000:00:00.0: BAR 8: assigned [mem 0x600000000-0x6000fffff]
[    0.940790] pci 0000:01:00.0: BAR 0: assigned [mem 0x600000000-0x600003fff 64bit]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPUs and some other cards I've tested run into BAR allocation issues, but this card seemed to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ran &lt;code&gt;ip a&lt;/code&gt; to see if by some dumb luck, the card was already supported in Pi OS, but I had no such luck. Only the built-in &lt;code&gt;wlan0&lt;/code&gt; interface was listed alongside &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like it's time to recompile the kernel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after going through the struggle of recompiling the Linux kernel almost a dozen times for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikpgZu6kLKE&quot;&gt;first Pi GPU testing video&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to set up a reliable cross-compile environment on my Mac, which has a much faster processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cross-compiling the kernel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment is built inside a virtual machine on my Mac, and the main reason for that is it's hard to mount the Raspberry Pi ext4 filesystem on my Mac (even with Docker for Mac), but it's easy to do inside a Linux VM under VirtualBox. I have to do that to be able to copy the compiled kernel into place for the Pi when using microSD cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other ways to do this, e.g. copying driver-specific files over the network instead of the entire kernel, or using netboot—but for now this is how I'm doing it since it's reliable and repeatable in a variety of situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full instructions for cross-compiling are available in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi PCIe project&lt;/a&gt; repo on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/tree/master/extras/cross-compile&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Linux Cross-compilation Environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/intel-iwlwifi-support-kernel-menuconfig.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iwlwifi enable MVM kernel support for Intel AX200 driver menuconfig compile Linux&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing is to configure the kernel using &lt;code&gt;menuconfig&lt;/code&gt; (or by hand if you so wish), and to enable the following options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Device Drivers &amp;gt; Network device support &amp;gt; Wireless LAN &amp;gt; Intel &amp;gt; &quot;Intel Wireless WiFi Next Gen AGN (iwlwifi)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Intel Wireless WiFi MVM Firmware support&quot; (under the iwlwifi option, once selected)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once that configuration is saved, compile the kernel. On my Mac, in the VM, it takes around 10 minutes. On the Pi 4, it takes around an hour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;3.9375&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need more help and details? Check out the video I made on the entire process here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csI19aOJEik&quot;&gt;WiFi 6 on the Raspberry Pi CM4 makes it Fly!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the compile is done, follow the rest of the instructions to copy the built kernel, dtbs, etc. over to the microSD card (assuming you're using a CM4 Lite—otherwise mount the eMMC version of the CM4 separately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the copying was finished, I unmounted both partitions, and shut down the VM. I pulled the microSD card from my Mac, put it back in the Pi, booted it up, and crossed my fingers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intalling the Intel WiFi Firmware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged into the Pi and ran &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; to check the logs... and I realized there must be something missing, because I saw the message &lt;code&gt;no suitable firmware found&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to install the appropriate device firmware from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org&quot;&gt;Linux Wireless&lt;/a&gt; website. I found the driver download for the AX200 on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi&quot;&gt;Intel wireless driver page&lt;/a&gt;, and installed it on the Pi like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ wget https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/_media/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi/iwlwifi-cc-46.3cfab8da.0.tgz
$ tar -xvzf iwlwifi-cc-46.3cfab8da.0.tgz
$ cd iwlwifi-cc-46.3cfab8da.0/
$ sudo cp iwlwifi-*.ucode /lib/firmware
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rebooted the Pi and crossed my fingers &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running into errors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I ran &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; and saw a lot more output, but also a lot of errors. Using &lt;code&gt;dmesg --follow&lt;/code&gt;, I found there were similar errors being printed out every couple seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And checking with &lt;code&gt;ip a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;iw list&lt;/code&gt;, I found that there was a new wireless device, but it seemed to be stuck in a loop, incrementing its ID each time it tried initializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two main errors I found were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[   50.097951] thermal thermal_zone1: failed to read out thermal zone (-61)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[   50.898495] iwlwifi 0000:01:00.0: Failed to configure RX queues: -5
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermal zone issue was just misdirection; it's not fatal, and in fact, if I manually read out the thermal zone data, it seems to work, so it's probably a bug in the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second error, I eventually found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/3cab5072-17a2-4d9a-2077-93788971c6c4@invisiblethingslab.com/T/#u&quot;&gt;helpful patch on the Linux kernel mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution Paweł Marczewski came up with was to delete the error message and the check that triggered it. I figured it was worth a try, so I patched Intel's WiFi driver using the diff in that email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patching Intel's WiFi Driver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied out the diff straight from the mailing list page, booted my cross-compile environment again, logged in, and went back into the Linux source directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a new file called &lt;code&gt;iwlwifi.patch&lt;/code&gt; with the contents of the diff from the mailing list, and applied it with &lt;code&gt;git apply -v iwlwifi.patch&lt;/code&gt;. The patch applied cleanly with an offset, and so I recompiled (much faster the 2nd time), copied everything over to the Pi's microSD card, and booted the Pi with the patched driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It works!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged into the Pi, and checked &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt;, and it worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;code&gt;ip a&lt;/code&gt; to check for the interface, and it showed up as &lt;code&gt;wlan1&lt;/code&gt;, and I ran &lt;code&gt;iw list&lt;/code&gt;, and it showed up correctly there too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the last thing to test was connecting to my network. I edited the WPA supplicant file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf&lt;/code&gt;, setting my country code and network details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
country=us

network={
 scan_ssid=1
 ssid=&quot;geerling-acn&quot;
 psk=&quot;my-network-passphrase&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saved the file and rebooted the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything connected, and the WiFi card picked up an IP address. We were in business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing speeds ... and realizing my network is 802.11ac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I did this, I ran a few tests using &lt;code&gt;iperf&lt;/code&gt; but realized at this point that I had an 802.11ax wireless card connecting to a pokey old 802.11ac wireless router. So I had to figure out a way to connect over WiFi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing speeds ... and realizing I don't have another computer with 802.11ax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of upgrading my entire home network, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/22#issuecomment-727595765&quot;&gt;PixlRainbow on GitHub suggested&lt;/a&gt; I try upgrading one of my other computers to WiFi 6, then test connecting &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; directly to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was excited when I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3nGeRiB&quot;&gt;$20 'Wise Tiger' Intel AX200 card&lt;/a&gt; for my Dell XPS 13 laptop. I bought it and installed it in the Dell, and made the video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C760v9XpkzE&quot;&gt;How to Upgrade a Dell XPS 13 to WiFi 6 (802.11ax)&lt;/a&gt; of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I tested the speeds, I was disappointed to find the upgraded card could only pump through 300-400 Mbps on the XPS 13, due to the two-by-two antenna performance and configuration on the Dell. My MacBook Pro, which &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; have WiFi 6, can get speeds up to 900 Mbps over 802.11ac, so the design of the entire system is extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy to have WiFi 6 in my Dell laptop, but it wasn't good enough to test how much speed I could get out of my Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing speeds again ... and realizing my wired network is 1 Gbps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my next step was upgrading my Wireless router. And there are a lot of AX routers available, but most of the ones with faster-than-gigabit speeds cost a lot more than the basic models. And if I wanted to break the gigabit barrier, I'd need one with a faster uplink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my local Micro Center had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3re0KDy&quot;&gt;ASUS RT-AX86U WiFi 6 router&lt;/a&gt; with a 2.5 Gbps switchable LAN/WAN port. My home Internet connection can't do anything near that much (thanks, Spectrum!), but I do want to upgrade my internal network to 10 Gbps soon, so it'd be nice to have the fast WiFi connection too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought that router, and replaced my old router with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was at this point that I realized two more things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I STILL didn't have any other computers with more than one gigabit of connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had blown through my budget for this project weeks ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;So... I decided to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I bought ten gigabit networking gear, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KQ4rhO&quot;&gt;MikroTik 4 SFP+ port 10G switch&lt;/a&gt;... and I realized after-the-fact the particular transceivers I bought wouldn't work with the router's 2.5 Gbps port—they only did 1 or 10 Gbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And second, I decided to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/22#issuecomment-743984939&quot;&gt;advice of St0nedB on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and set up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net&quot;&gt;ASUSWRT-Merlin firmware&lt;/a&gt; on my router so I could run &lt;code&gt;iperf&lt;/code&gt; directly between my router and the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/22#issuecomment-748534025&quot;&gt;benchmarking with &lt;code&gt;iperf&lt;/code&gt; directly with the ASUS router&lt;/a&gt; are linked on GitHub, if you want to try the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, here's the bottom line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/cm4-networking-benchmarks.png&quot; alt=&quot;Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 Benchmarks - Built-in WiFi AC, Wired 1 Gbps, WiFi 6 AX&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;353&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over my Gigabit network, the Pi matched it's built-in gigabit wired network performance, maxing it out at 930 megabits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And connected directly to the AX router, it could pump through 1.34 gigabits (or a total of 1.5 gigabits bidirectional, with a full-duplex transfer). This WiFi 6 AX200 card runs &lt;em&gt;30% faster&lt;/em&gt; than the built-in gigabit wired networking, and a whopping &lt;em&gt;16x faster&lt;/em&gt; than the built-in WiFi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can probably get even faster, but I was happy enough with this result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what did I learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting faster WiFi on the Raspberry Pi isn't too hard, but it does require some extra tweaking and a kernel patch, making it hard for most people to get it working. Hopefully the issues I ran into will be easier to work around in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explore more of the possibilities this fast wireless setup enables, like using WiFi 6 along with fast SATA or NVMe storage for a super fast wireless NAS, or using WiFi 6 along with gigabit ethernet to build a custom router or access point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;text --size-l&quot;&gt;Hotwire is an alternative approach to building modern web applications without using much JavaScript by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire.&lt;/strong&gt; This makes for fast first-load pages, keeps template rendering on the server, and allows for a simpler, more productive development experience in any programming language, without sacrificing any of the speed or responsiveness associated with a traditional single-page application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow the HTML-over-the-wire approach as merely inspiration for your own tooling, or you can use these Hotwire designed frameworks created by the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; to power &lt;a href=&quot;https://hey.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;HEY&lt;/a&gt;. They work together, complementing each other to give you a complete solution across all platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;space --top-flush&quot;&gt;The heart of Hotwire is Turbo. A set of complimentary techniques for speeding up page changes and form submissions, dividing complex pages into components, and stream partial page updates over WebSocket. All without writing any JavaScript at all. And designed from the start to integrate perfectly with native hybrid applications for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;space --top-flush&quot;&gt;While Turbo usually takes care of at least 80% of the interactivity that traditionally would have required JavaScript, there are still cases where a dash of custom code is required. Stimulus makes this easy with a HTML-centric approach to state and wiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;space --top-flush&quot;&gt;Standardizes the way that web and native parts of a mobile hybrid application talk to each other via HTML bridge attributes. This makes it easy to progressively level-up web interactions with native replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tillis Releases Text of Bipartisan Legislation to Fight Illegal Streaming</title>
<link>https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/tillis-releases-text-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/tillis-releases-text-of-bipartisan-legislation-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. – Today, U.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, released text of bipartisan legislation that would punish large-scale criminal streaming services that willfully and for commercial advantage or private financial gain offer to the public illicit services dedicated to illegally streaming copyrighted material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Protecting Lawful Streaming Act would apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services. The law will not sweep in normal practices by online service providers, good faith business disputes, noncommercial activities, or in any way impact individuals who access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. Individuals who might use pirate streaming services will not be affected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The shift toward streaming content online has resulted in criminal streaming services illegally distributing copyrighted material that costs the U.S. economy nearly $30 billion every year, and discourages the production of creative content that Americans enjoy,”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;said Senator Tillis&lt;/strong&gt;. “This commonsense legislation was drafted with the input of creators, user groups, and technology companies and is narrowly targeted so that only criminal organizations are punished and that no individual streamer has to worry about the fear of prosecution. That’s why groups as diverse as CCIA and Public Knowledge are neutral on this proposal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), John Cornyn (R-TX), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), and David Perdue (R-GA).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Read the text&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tillis.senate.gov/services/files/A30B0C08-FB97-4F90-BB60-43283EB7AF35&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;Background:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Streaming has become the primary way that audiences consume entertainment. It has also become a major form of piracy. Last year, one study reported that digital video piracy costs the U.S. economy $29.2 billion a year. Streaming piracy touches numerous creative sectors, including major motion pictures, television programs, music, audiobooks, live sports, and pay-per-view programming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under current law, only violations of the reproduction and distribution rights of copyright owners can be charged as felonies, while criminal infringement via streaming (or “publicly performing”) can only be charged as a misdemeanor. This is known as the streaming loophole – and it is particularly harmful to the U.S. economy because streaming has become the most common form of criminal copyright infringement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This bipartisan, consensus legislation will provide the Department of Justice with the authority to bring felony charges against a digital transmission service that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;is primarily designed or provided for the purpose of streaming copyrighted works without the authority of the copyright owner or the law; or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;has no commercially significant purpose or use other than to stream copyrighted works without the authority of the copyright owner or the law; or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;is intentionally marketed by or at the direction of that person to promote its use in streaming copyrighted works without the authority of the copyright owner or the law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wordsection1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;###&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: Co-founder wants me to leave but won&amp;#039;t entertain a buy out offer</title>

<description>I'm the technical co-founder of a pre-revenue startup. We were 51/49% to them and took a small round of pre-seed funding (~$100k) so our cap table is approx 40% for me and co-founder, 10% option pool and 10% investor. We have very standard shareholder agreements for 4yr reverse vesting with 1yr cliff.
&lt;p&gt;My (non-technical) co-founder spent $10k to create the initial website over a year ago with the idea. I joined about 11 months ago and since then the idea has changed a bit, we've built loads of products, grown from 2k users to 60k users and continuing to grow due to dominating SEO for our niche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently my co-founder said they wanted to work on it themselves. I said I didn't want to leave. They suggested I go down to 3% equity and they continue. I said they would need to buy out my equity at a fair price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My co-founder doesn't have the money, and the business only has around $40k cash in the bank right now. My co-founder also won't entertain the idea of raising external money to buy me out, or monetizing the site right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me this seems ridiculous as I'm literally just giving away my equity after spending 11 months building the tech and growing the business. Right now if we stuck adsense on the site, we'd generate $5k/mo, and we have inbound sales leads looking to spend upwards of $40k with us. Basically, the business is primed to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will not entertain the idea of me buying them out for cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are my options here? It's basically being presented to me as &quot;Take the 3% otherwise you'll own 40% of nothing&quot;. I don't really want any equity in the company at this point if I'm not involved.&lt;/p&gt;
