&lt;p class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;With the help of several of the top-ranked players in the A23 lobby, hundreds of balance tweaks have been made in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt; the past year and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;lmost all units and structures have been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt;adjust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;ed. The end result is a sleeker, more balanced gameplay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt; experience&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt; in A24:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;c20 lst-kix_xikdc4jar1by-0 start&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;Civilisations have been rebalanced, giving players more viable choices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;Late-game has been reworked substantially, with less snowballing and more viable champions, which means more variety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;Heroes can only be trained once per game, so you’ll have to know when to use them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;All civilisations now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt;have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;table, for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt;training cavalry and chariots,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;and an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;rsena&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt;l, for constructing siege engines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;Fortresses can no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt; longer train soldiers but have a territory root, making them&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;more defensive structures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt; and better at protecting your base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;Female Citizens and Citizen Soldiers can now place the foundations of all structures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;Many, many other small tweaks and corrections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-4762&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4764 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image12-400x237.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;237&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image12-400x237.jpg 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image12-768x455.jpg 768w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image12-500x296.jpg 500w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image12.jpg 1134w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;City-building fans will enjoy this new option: you can now easily place buildings next to each other with snapping!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This functionality can be toggled with Ctrl, and you can choose whether you want it on or off by default, so it is, as always, up to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.f51qx62ylog7&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;Renderer improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;This release introduces anti-aliasing in the renderer: you can choose between no anti-aliasing, FXAA and various levels of MSAA, if you have the GPU power for it. A Contrast Adaptive Sharpening filter has also been added to the engine. For using these options we recommend your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;system&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14 c19&quot;&gt;supports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;OpenGL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; 3.3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14 c19&quot;&gt;or later versions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;The ocean shader also received some tweaks, most importantly near the edges of the map, which now looks better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This new in-game editor will make it much more accessible to change your hotkeys. Further, the hotkeys have been reworked to use scancodes, so the default hotkeys will be compatible with any keyboard layout!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4750 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image32-400x395.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;395&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image32-400x395.png 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image32-304x300.png 304w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image32.png 744w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.u6pqnj2os8j7&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;Formation improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Alpha 24 gives you new tools to work with formations: you can now pick a default formation to put your units in when given “Walk” and “Patrol” orders, and you can also choose to automatically disband formations when your units are ordered to Attack or Gather, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.6z8q7ao59hkf&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;Status effects (and modifiers)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Modders will like this one: you can now give status effects to your units, changing their stats in various ways. Stat modifiers can also be applied directly by triggers and in other ways, without having to hack around auras or technologies. 0 A.D. does not yet use them much, but this really gives you more power to make new custom maps and custom game-modes without having to create a lot of new templates, e.g., tower defence mods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4736 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image16-400x351.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image16-400x351.png 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image16-342x300.png 342w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image16.png 637w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.8n5k824fab23&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;World population setting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;Despite our best efforts, the game can still lag when there are a lot of units on the map. World Pop (Population) gives you one way to still have epic fights but good  performance: choose a maximum total pop which&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;. When one player is defeated, their share is distributed among the remaining players. Start a 4v4 with 150 pop-limit each, and the last 2 players can have 600 pop between them!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; Will you keep that poor enemy alive to hinder your opponent or can you use the extra population capacity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.pp3mmad4hygd&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;Lobby improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;This was requested a lot: you can now host password-protected games in the lobby! This makes it easy to play with your friends without having to find your external IP or setting up your router. Further, we’ve also improved your security by hiding the host IP until players have successfully joined your game,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;which drastically reduces the risk of DDOS by hostile players.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.bnlcelvbj7r6&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;In-game user interface (GUI) improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;We strive to make the game more accessible and easier to use, and this release is no different:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;c20 lst-kix_axrluirfk8dy-0 start&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c7 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;You can easily see your number of active gatherers under the resource count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4744 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image24-400x30.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image24-400x30.png 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image24-768x58.png 768w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image24-500x38.png 500w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image24.png 919w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;c20 lst-kix_axrluirfk8dy-0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c7 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;An overlay with ceasefire time has been added so you don’t get caught out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c7 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Tooltips in general have been significantly improved, in particular the resource gathering rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4724 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-400x114.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;114&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-400x114.png 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-768x218.png 768w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2-500x142.png 500w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image2.png 788w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;h.1l9po8i7pyas&quot; class=&quot;c30 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c28 c18&quot;&gt;Map browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;For those looking for an alternate way of picking a map to play, Alpha 24 introduces the “Map Browser”. Accessible from a button in the Match Setup interface, users can navigate through maps a little more intuitively than using a dropdown menu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4734 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image14-400x287.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;287&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image14-400x287.png 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image14-768x551.png 768w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image14-418x300.png 418w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image14.png 1117w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;h.wr682uz2015a&quot; class=&quot;c15 c30&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c28 c18&quot;&gt;Catafalque overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Those who play the “Relic Capture” gamemode will no doubt be aware that the “relics” in question are Catafalques – reliquaries of dead heroes encapsulated within wheeled carts – and each of these has a small selection of beneficial auras. Alpha 24 introduces a “Catafalque Overview” screen, accessible from the “Learn to Play” submenu of the Main Menu, which makes it easy to learn their different characteristics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4740 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image20-400x397.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image20-400x397.png 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image20-150x150.png 150w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image20-302x300.png 302w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image20.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;h.hqq23cej8ilk&quot; class=&quot;c30 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c28 c18&quot;&gt;Civilization overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;The long-existing “Civilization Overview” screen has had some background improvements. Because most of the information is now pulled from the game files, it is now considerably more accurate than in previous Alphas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;h.qadqp7ywtx8i&quot; class=&quot;c30 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c28 c18&quot;&gt;Game set-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;There have been a few added capabilities to the game setup, such as choosing the landscape of random maps when several are available, and a more obvious indicator that the game will be Rated for Online Play.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.48ylen4ia0m2&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;Unit behaviour improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This alpha improves on many small things:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;c20 lst-kix_v7fm91v5xbmj-0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;Ship pickup has been improved and should require less micromanagement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;Units no longer ‘slide’ at the end of their movement, and movement in general has been improved, with far fewer cases of units being stuck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c16 c14&quot;&gt;Cheering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt; has been reworked: instead of cheering when receiving a promotion, units now cheer when all enemy units in sight have been defeated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;If you’ve played MP, you might have seen an annoying strategy called ‘Dancing’ where enemy units would easily avoid arrow fire and force you to micromanage your archers. This is no longer possible, making the game more fun for all players.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;c11 c12 li-bullet-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c6&quot;&gt;Packing/Unpacking behaviour has been improved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.3bbpf35cd72j&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-4754&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-4760 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image9-400x293.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; srcset=&quot;https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image9-400x293.jpg 400w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image9-768x563.jpg 768w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image9-409x300.jpg 409w, https://play0ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image9.jpg 1323w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.tlcnce6nf20w&quot; class=&quot;c9 c15&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c6 c17 c18&quot;&gt;Reinforcement-learning interface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;Reinforcement learning is a Machine Learning technique that can be used to train AI to play games, and now 0 A.D. has one. We’re excited about this new possibility, because the extensive and easy moddability of the game means you could set up many kinds of complex environments and RL agents without having to recode everything from scratch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7 c5&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;We invite any AI developers, researchers or anybody else to help with our AI. More could be found in here (https://trac.wildfiregames.com/wiki/GettingStartedReinforcementLearning)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;h.ra5gh7dekdnv&quot; class=&quot;c33&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;Art: n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17 c14&quot;&gt;ew&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The new art developments are too numerous to list individually, and include reworked meshes, animations (including new idle, attack, defence and gather animations), textures and materials for a large number of units, as well as new models, including new horse models, textures and animations, new shield models and designs, new helmet models and variants, especially for the Romans, Gauls, Britons and Greek civs. Many new and improved unit textures, weapons and props for a number of civs including, among others, the Persians, Iberians and Carthaginians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c4 c5&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The Ptolemies now have a few more historically accurate Hellenized building models and the Britons have a new blacksmith, while the Gauls have a new, more historically accurate wonder and an assembly building that can train trumpeters to intimidate the enemy. New scaffolding, dirt and decal textures for buildings have been added. Many of the ships in-game have been entirely remodeled from the ground up. Siege artillery has been completely remodeled as well, including considerably improved animations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;There is also a lot of new and improved flora, including trees, bushes and grasses. We have new cliffs, new particle actors for snow and clouds and a few new terrain textures, as well as new sounds, and voices. There is a brand new welcome screen, and there are also many improved icons, and unit portraits for the GUI. This is in addition to a myriad of smaller fixes, corrections and optimizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6&quot;&gt;New Requirements: Windows XP, Windows Vista, and anything below macOS 10.12 are no longer supported. The game also now requires SSE2. Furthermore, while ARM macs are supported, unfortunately the code running on them isn’t native yet, so users on this platform should expect a performance loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6&quot;&gt;Several modules of the game have been partly rewritten or extensively modified for Alpha 24, which will make them work better and make it easier to extend them in the future. Notable examples include the GUI GameSetup pages, the UnitMotion component, and the renderer has seen plenty of changes with the removal of the OpenGL 1.0, 90’s style “Fixed-Point” pipeline. Which in turn raised the lowest supported version to OpenGL 2.0. In addition, we started to fully use the ARB shader pipeline.(Modders, all of this means you will also find there are plenty of new cool things you can do!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6&quot;&gt;Alpha 24 sees the adoption of Visual Studio 2017 as the main Windows compiler (Alpha 23B had Visual Studio 2013) , and we have upgraded our version of C++ standard from C++11 to C++17, allowing us to write faster and cleaner code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;This release also saw major upgrades to many core libraries we use.  Alpha 23 was released with Spidermonkey 38, released alongside Firefox 38 in May 2015. This time, we’ve upgraded to the last “ESR” version, Spidermonkey 78, released in June 2020! This means we can use newer Javascript syntax, and the engine bindings have been upgraded. Other libraries have been updated on macOS and Windows, which let us support more platforms&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;but also required us to drop some.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.ljh9cc5hcn7t&quot; class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;The name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c25 c18 c34&quot;&gt;Xšayāršā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c40&quot;&gt;Xšayāršā&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;(pronounced Khsha-ya-ṛsha; IPA: /xʃajaːr̩ʃaː/)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6&quot;&gt;is a transcription of the Old Persian name 𐎧𐏁𐎹𐎠𐎼𐏁𐎠 (x-š-y-a-r-š-a), better known by its Greek spelling: Xerxēs. Xerxes I the Great was the ruler of the Achaemenid Empire from 485 to 465 BC. We decided to name Alpha 24 after this inspiring ancient ruler to celebrate the ancient Persian civilisation, and to reflect upcoming changes in the internal governance structure of 0 A.D.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6&quot;&gt;The Persian Empire was considerably larger than any preceding state anywhere in the world, and its administration system would have a long-lasting impact. It consisted of about two dozen satrapies (provinces), which were former kingdoms or conquered peoples. Each satrapy was headed by a satrap (governor or viceroy) and supplied the Persian King of Kings (emperor) with a yearly tribute and troops, but were internally largely autonomous. This organisation outlived the Achaemenids and was continued under the Macedonians, Seleucids, and Arsacids (Parthians).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Xerxes inherited the empire from his father Darius I the Great. He continued his father’s reforms and expanded the imperial building programmes. Early in his reign, he led an ultimately unsuccessful invasion of Greece, with victories at Thermopylae, Artemisium, and Athens in 480 BC, but defeats at Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale in 479 BC. The rest of his reign was largely peaceful. The Persian Empire arguably reached its zenith under Xerxes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.ciosq5uw3166&quot; class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c6&quot;&gt;This release cycle is the longest we’ve ever had as you no doubt noticed, and it was a bumpy ride. Despite this, we’re hoping to get back to a more regular schedule now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;As usual, f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;or the next alpha, we welcome fan suggestions for words relating to the ancient world beginning with the letter Y. Keep it original and related to the time frame portrayed in 0 A.D. (c. 500 BC – 1 BC). Post your proposal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14 c22&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c10&quot; href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/35736-alpha-25-name-suggestions/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1613835178171000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2diiSb1CYX8wy61CTapxPd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c37&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How can you not be romantic about programming?</title>
<link>https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/09/08/how-can-you-not-be-romantic-about-programming/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/09/08/how-can-you-not-be-romantic-about-programming/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;08 Sep 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU&quot;&gt;a scene in Moneyball&lt;/a&gt; in which Brad Pitt’s character, the manager of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics&quot;&gt;Oakland A’s&lt;/a&gt;, is watching a recording of one of his players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not be romantic about baseball?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that exists — the good &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the bad kind. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625&quot;&gt;wizards&lt;/a&gt;. Instructions are &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html&quot;&gt;“like a sorcerer’s spells”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, &lt;em&gt;a hack&lt;/em&gt;, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like a poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the code is fed to a machine and, &lt;em&gt;abracadabra&lt;/em&gt;, a brightly coloured &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development&quot;&gt;amusement park&lt;/a&gt; appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades, not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday. There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime. Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it all comes crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close. But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it. And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Destroy the Earth (2006)</title>
<link>https://qntm.org/destroy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qntm.org/destroy</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec0&quot;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destroying the Earth is harder than you may have been led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've seen the action movies where the bad guy threatens to destroy the Earth. You've heard people on the news claiming that the next nuclear war or cutting down rainforests or persisting in releasing hideous quantities of pollution into the atmosphere threatens to end the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth is built to &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt;. It is a 4,550,000,000-year-old, 5,973,600,000,000,000,000,000-tonne &lt;em&gt;ball of iron&lt;/em&gt;. It has taken more devastating asteroid hits in its lifetime than you've had hot dinners, and lo, it still orbits merrily. So my first piece of advice to you, dear would-be Earth-destroyer, is: do NOT think this will be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a guide for wusses whose aim is merely to wipe out humanity. I can in no way guarantee the complete extinction of the human race via any of these methods, real or imaginary. Humanity is wily and resourceful, and many of the methods outlined below will take many years to even become available, let alone implement, by which time mankind may well have spread to other planets; indeed, other star systems. If total human genocide &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; your ultimate goal, you are reading the wrong document. There are far more efficient ways of doing this, many which are available and feasible RIGHT NOW. Nor is this a guide for those wanting to annihilate everything from single-celled life upwards, render Earth uninhabitable or simply conquer it. These are &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; goals in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a guide for those who do not want the Earth to be there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec1&quot;&gt;Mission statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of what I hope to be a technically and scientifically accurate document, I will define our goal thus: &lt;strong&gt;by any means necessary, to change the Earth into something other than a planet or a dwarf planet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Astronomical Union defines a planet as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a celestial body that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is in orbit around the Sun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and a dwarf planet as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a celestial body that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is in orbit around the Sun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is not a satellite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Since &quot;celestial body&quot; does not include the Earth, we shall assume for the sake of pedantry that the IAU meant to say &quot;astronomical body&quot;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These definitions instantly suggest some very simple ways of stripping the Earth of its planethood, such as hurling it into interstellar space, moving it into orbit around a gas giant, or moving it into a solar orbit whose neighbourhood is not cleared (the main asteroid belt being the most obvious choice). A slightly less obvious method would be &lt;em&gt;redefining &quot;planet&quot; not to include the Earth&lt;/em&gt;. Naturally, these methods (the latter of which is by far the most feasible method listed in this document) will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be considered to count - &lt;em&gt;redefining something doesn't make it go away&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are left, therefore, with the challenge of significantly altering the Earth's physical structure, or else reducing its mass such that it can maintain a shape which is not round. For example: blowing it up, turning it into a dust cloud, merging it with a larger body, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec2&quot;&gt;Current Earth-Destruction Status&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of times the Earth has been destroyed: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information courtesy of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/board&quot;&gt;International Earth-Destruction Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec3&quot;&gt;Methods for destroying the Earth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be listed here, a method must actually work. That is, &lt;em&gt;according to current scientific understanding&lt;/em&gt;, it must be possible for the Earth to actually be destroyed by this method, however improbable or impractical it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods are ranked in order of feasibility. Feasibility ratings are given out of ten - these are based primarily on my gut instinct and do not reflect actual mathematical probabilities in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several methods involve moving the Earth a considerable distance off its usual orbital track. This is an essay in itself, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;a separate page has been created for it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;249.4924590015&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Annihilated by an equivalent quantity of antimatter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: An entire planet Earth made from antimatter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimatter - the most explosive substance possible - can be manufactured in small quantities using any large particle accelerator, but this will take preposterous amounts of time to produce the required amounts. If you can create the appropriate machinery, it may be possible to find or scrape together an approximately Earth-sized chunk of rock and simply to &quot;flip&quot; it all through a fourth spacial dimension, turning it all to antimatter at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Once you've generated your antimatter, probably in space, just launch it en masse towards Earth. The resulting release of energy (obeying Einstein's famous mass-energy equation, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is equivalent to the amount the Sun outputs in some &lt;em&gt;89 million years&lt;/em&gt;. Alternatively, if your matter-flipping machinery is a little more flexible, turn half the Earth into antimatter (say, the Western Hemisphere) and watch the fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: When matter and antimatter collide, they completely annihilate each other, leaving nothing but energy. All that would be left of Earth is a scintillating flash of light expanding across space forever. This method is one of the most permanent and total on this list, as the very matter which makes up the Earth ceases to exist, making it virtually impossible to even reassemble the planet afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 2/10. It IS possible to create antimatter, so, &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt;, this method IS possible. But since the proposed matter-to-antimatter flipping machine is probably complete science fiction, we're looking at stupid, stupid amounts of time to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: With a significantly smaller amount of antimatter, you can simply blow the Earth up - see later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: This method suggested by Thomas Wootten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fissioned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a universal fission machine (e.g. a particle accelerator), an unimaginable amount of energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Take every single atom on planet Earth and individually split each one down to become hydrogen and helium. Fissioning heavier elements to become hydrogen and helium is the opposite of the self-sustaining reaction that powers the Sun: it requires you to put energy &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; which is why the energy requirements here are so vast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: While Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are gas giants composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, they are massive enough to actually hold on to their tenuous atmospheres. The Earth is not; the gases would dissipate away. You'd get a wispy mess of gas where there should have been a planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 2/10. &lt;em&gt;Technically&lt;/em&gt; possible, but, again, hopelessly, mind-bogglingly inefficient and time-consuming. You're looking at billions of years &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt;, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: This method suggested by John Routledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;41.962768746723&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sucked into a microscopic black hole&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a microscopic black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that black holes are not eternal, they evaporate due to Hawking radiation. For your average black hole this takes an unimaginable amount of time, but for really small ones it could happen almost instantaneously, as evaporation time is dependent on mass. Therefore your microscopic black hole must have greater than a certain threshold mass, roughly equal to the mass of Mount Everest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a microscopic black hole is tricky, since one needs a reasonable amount of neutronium, but may possibly be achievable by jamming large numbers of atomic nuclei together until they stick. This is left as an exercise to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: simply place your black hole on the surface of the Earth and wait. Black holes are of such high density that they pass through ordinary matter like a stone through the air. The black hole will plummet through the ground, eating its way to the centre of the Earth and all the way through to the other side: then, it'll oscillate back, over and over like a matter-absorbing pendulum. Eventually it will come to rest at the core, having absorbed enough matter to slow it down. Then you just need to wait, while it sits and consumes matter until the whole Earth is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: a singularity with a radius of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/8befk&quot;&gt;about nine millimetres&lt;/a&gt;, which will then proceed to happily orbit the Sun as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 3/10. Highly, highly unlikely. But not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: Hmm. The problem is, the microscopic black hole would still be in hydrostatic equilibrium, so it would still qualify as a planet according to the IAU!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0552133264/qid=1107902118/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/026-2405488-8406058&quot;&gt;The Dark Side Of The Sun&lt;/a&gt;, by Terry Pratchett. It is true that the microscopic black hole idea is an age-old science fiction mainstay which predates Pratchett by a long time, he was &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; original source for the idea, so that's what I'm putting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;36.530903328051&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cooked in a solar oven&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: Means for focusing a good few percent of the Sun's energy output directly on the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm talking about here is: mirrors, and lots of them. Intercept several decent sized asteroids for raw materials and start cranking out kilometre-square sheets of lightweight reflective material (aluminised mylar, aluminium foil, nickel foil, iron foil or whatever you can scrape together). They need to be capable of changing focus direction at will because, while a few may be placed at the Earth-Sun system's Lagrangian points, the vast majority cannot be stationary in space and the relative positions of the Earth and Sun will be shifting as time passes, so attach a few manoeuvering thrusters and a communications and navigation system to each sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/data&quot;&gt;Preliminary calculations&lt;/a&gt; suggest you would need roughly two trillion square kilometres of mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Command your focusing array to concentrate as much solar energy as you can directly on the Earth - perhaps on its core, perhaps at a point on its surface. So the theory goes, this will cause the Earth to generally increase in temperature until it completely boils away, becoming a gas cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variation on this method involves turning the Sun into a gigantic hydrogen gas laser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: A gas cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 3/10. The major problem here is: What's to stop the matter cooling and becoming a planet again? In fact, once the top layer of planet becomes gaseous, what would compel it to vent into space rather than remaining on the surface, absorbing more heat and preventing the lower layers from even being heated? Unless the amount of heat put in was really immense, all you'd get is a gas planet at best, and a temporary one at that. Moving the Earth towards the Sun (see later) is likely to be a far more viable method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: This method suggested by Sean Timpa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;21.821621621622&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overspun&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: some means of accelerating the Earth's rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerating the Earth's rotation is a rather different matter from &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;moving it&lt;/a&gt;. External interactions with asteroids might move the Earth but won't have a significant effect on how fast it spins. And certainly it won't spin the Earth fast enough. You need to build rockets or railguns at the Equator, all facing West. Or perhaps something more exotic...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: The theory is, if you spin the Earth fast enough, it'll fly apart as the bits at the Equator start moving fast enough to overcome gravity. In theory, one revolution every 84 minutes should do it - even slower would be fine, in fact, as the Earth would become flatter and thus more prone to breaking apart as you spun it faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 4/10. This could be done - there is a definite upper limit on how fast something like the Earth can spin before it breaks apart. However, spinning a planet is even more difficult than moving it. It's not as simple as attaching rockets pointing in each direction to each side...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: This method suggested by Matthew Wakeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;73.027115858669&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blown up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: 25,000,000,000,000 tonnes of antimatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: This method involves detonating a bomb so big that it blasts the Earth to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, to say the least, requires a big bomb. All the explosives mankind has ever created, nuclear or non-, gathered together and detonated simultaneously, would make a significant crater and wreck the planet's ecosystem, but barely scratch the surface of the planet. There is evidence that in the past, asteroids have hit the Earth with the explosive yield of five billion Hiroshima bombs - and such evidence is &lt;em&gt;difficult to find&lt;/em&gt;. It is, in short, insanely difficult to significantly alter the Earth's structure with explosives. This is not to mention the gravity problem. Just because you blasted the Earth apart doesn't mean you blasted it apart for good. If you don't blast it hard enough, the pieces will fall back together again under mutual gravitational attraction, and Earth, like the liquid metal Terminator, will reform from its shattered shards. You have to blow the Earth up hard enough to overcome that attraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How hard is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/data&quot;&gt;lengthy calculations&lt;/a&gt; you find that to liberate that much energy is equivalent to the complete annihilation of around 1,246,400,000,000 tonnes of antimatter. That's assuming zero energy loss to heat, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/1996/TM-107030.pdf&quot;&gt;neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; and radiation, which is unlikely to be the case in reality: You'll probably need to up the dose by at least a factor of twenty. Once you've generated your antimatter, probably in space, just launch it en masse towards Earth. The resulting release of energy (obeying Einstein's famous mass-energy equation, E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) should be sufficient to split the Earth into a thousand pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Bear's novel, &quot;The Forge Of God&quot;, contains an interesting refinement of this technique. Here, the antagonist instead generates antimatter in the form of a &quot;slug&quot; of anti-neutronium - superdense material massing a billion kilograms per cubic centimetre. This is fired into the Earth's core. Neutronium passes through ordinary matter as easily as a ball flies through the air, so the anti-neutronium slug doesn't annihilate immediately; rather, it builds up a protective sheath of plasma around it as it plunges downwards towards the Earth's core. It's then followed up by a slug of regular neutronium, which also falls into the core, at a time calculated to meet the first slug head-on at the exact centre of the Earth, where they annihilate themselves, and soon afterwards, the Earth itself. Highly space-efficient, and with the added bonus of all the energy being released at the Earth's core, where it can do the most damage. In the book, the antagonists simultaneously detonate nuclear warheads in certain oceanic trenches, to weaken the crust and allow the planet to be blown apart more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rearranging Earth into two planets - which, provisionally, is sufficient according to my current criteria - would take slightly less energy, but considerably more finesse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: A second asteroid belt around the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: trembling writes, &quot;I still think that antimatter is crazy s**t, i.e. wouldn't want it on my flapjacks&quot;. Charles MacGee presents a very well-realised alternate source of explosives in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://lablemminglounge.blogspot.com/2008/02/how-to-destroy-earth-isotope.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;; this method involves generating the explosive energy by fusing together the lighter elements of Earth's mantle (magnesium and oxygen). Of course, this would involve the invention of an efficient magnesium fusion bomb. And then turning all of the Earth's mantle into bombs. How implausible! Well. Implausibility is a relative thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sucked into a giant black hole&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a black hole, extremely powerful rocket engines, and, optionally, a large rocky planetary body. The nearest black hole to our planet is 1600 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius, orbiting V4641.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: after locating your black hole, you need get it and the Earth together. This is likely to be the most time-consuming part of this plan. There are two methods, moving Earth or moving the black hole, though for best results you'd most likely move both at once. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;Guide to moving Earth&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to move the Earth. Several of the methods listed can be applied to the black hole too, though obviously not all of them, since it is impossible to physically touch the black hole, let alone build rockets on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: part of the mass of the black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 6/10. Very difficult, but &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: It's clear that dropping the Earth into a singularity is massive overkill. A reasonably strong gravitational field, such as might be associated with any body between Jupiter and a neutron star, would be sufficient to rip the Earth apart via tidal forces. These possibilities are dealt with further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Meticulously and systematically deconstructed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a mass driver. A mass driver is a sort of oversized electromagnetic railgun, which was once proposed as a way of getting mined materials back from the Moon to Earth - basically, you just load it into the driver and fire it upwards in roughly the right direction. Your design should be powerful enough to hit escape velocity of 11 kilometres per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a million tonnes of mass driven out of the Earth's gravity well per second, this would take 189,000,000 years. One mass driver would suffice, but ideally, lots (i.e. trillions) would be employed simultaneously. Alternatively you could use space elevators or conventional rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Basically, what we're going to do here is dig up the Earth, a big chunk at a time, and boost the whole lot of it into orbit. Yes. All six sextillion tonnes of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will ignore atmospheric considerations. Compared with the extra energy needed to overcome air friction, it would be a relatively trivial step to completely burn away the Earth's atmosphere before beginning the process. Even with this done, however, this method would require a - let me emphasize this - &lt;em&gt;titanic&lt;/em&gt; quantity of energy to carry out. Building a Dyson sphere ain't gonna cut it here. (Note: Actually, it would. But if you have the technology to build a Dyson sphere, why are you reading this?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: Many tiny pieces, some dropped into the Sun, the remainder scattered across the rest of the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 6/10. If we wanted to and were willing to devote resources to it, we could start this process RIGHT NOW. Indeed, what with all the gunk left in orbit, on the Moon and heading out into space, we already have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: this method arose when Joe Baldwin and I knocked our heads together by accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Pulverized by impact with blunt instrument&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a big heavy rock, something with a bit of a swing to it... perhaps Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Essentially, anything can be destroyed if you hit it hard enough. ANYTHING. The concept is simple: find a really, really big asteroid or planet, accelerate it up to some dazzling speed, and smash it into Earth, preferably head-on but whatever you can manage. The result: an absolutely spectacular collision, resulting hopefully in Earth (and, most likely, our &quot;cue ball&quot; too) being pulverized out of existence - smashed into any number of large pieces which if the collision is hard enough should have enough energy to overcome their mutual gravity and drift away forever, never to coagulate back into a planet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief analysis of the size of the object required can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/jul99/931435915.As.r.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Falling at the minimal impact velocity of 11 kilometres per second and assuming zero energy loss to heat and other energy forms, the cue ball would have to have roughly 60% of the mass of the Earth. Mars, the next planet out, &quot;weighs&quot; in at about 11% of Earth's mass, while Venus, the next planet in and also the nearest to Earth, has about 81%. Assuming that we would fire our cue ball into Earth at much greater than 11km/s (I'm thinking more like 50km/s), either of these would make great possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously a smaller rock would do the job, you just need to fire it faster. Taking mass dilation into account, a 5,000,000,000,000-tonne asteroid at 90% of light speed would do just as well. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;Guide to moving Earth&lt;/a&gt; for useful information on manoeuvring big hunks of rock across interplanetary distances. For smaller chunks, there are more options - a Bussard Ramjet (scoop up interstellar hydrogen at the front and fire it out the back as propellant) is one of the most technically feasible as of right now. Of course, a run-up would be needed...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: a variety of roughly Moon-sized chunks of rock, scattered haphazardly across the greater Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 7/10. Pretty plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: This method suggested by Andy Kirkpatrick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: Earth is believed to have been hit by an object the size of Mars at some point in the distant past before its surface cooled. This titanic collision resulted in... the Moon. You can download a simulated video of the impact from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swri.org/press/impact.htm&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. While the Mars-sized object in question obviously didn't hit Earth nearly as hard as we're proposing with this method, this does serve as a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Hurled into the Sun&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;Earthmoving equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Hurl the Earth into the Sun, where it will be rapidly melted and then vaporized by the Sun's heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending Earth on a collision course with the Sun is not as easy as one might think. Contrary to popular opinion, Earth's orbit is not &quot;unstable&quot; and Earth will not begin to spiral into the Sun if we give it the slightest of nudges (otherwise, you can bet it would have happened already). It's surprisingly easy to end up with Earth in a loopy elliptical orbit which merely roasts it for four months in every eight. Careful planning will be needed to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;one way&lt;/a&gt; of moving the Sun itself. Although the Sun is much bigger, and the Earth would be carried along by its gravity, it might be possible accelerate the Sun hard enough that it eventually catches the orbiting Earth, with the same net result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: a small globule of vaporized iron sinking slowly into the heart of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: As far as &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/data&quot;&gt;energy changes&lt;/a&gt; are concerned, this method is inferior to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is essentially a variation on the Solar Oven method listed above, wherein you bring the Sun to the Earth (in a manner of speaking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 9/10. Impossible at our current technological level, but will be possible one day, I'm certain. In the meantime, may happen by freak accident if something comes out of nowhere and randomly knocks Earth in precisely the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ripped apart by tidal forces&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;Earthmoving equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: When something (like a planet) orbits something else (like the Sun), the closer in it is, the faster it orbits. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, moves faster along its path than Earth, which in turn moves faster than Neptune, the furthest planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you move Earth close enough to the Sun, you'll find that it's close enough that the side of the Earth facing the Sun wants to orbit the Sun &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; than the side pointing away from it. That causes a strain. Move Earth close enough, within an imaginary boundary called the &lt;em&gt;Roche Limit&lt;/em&gt;, and the strain will be great enough to literally tear the planet Earth apart. It'll form one or more rings, much like the rings around Saturn (in fact this may be exactly where Saturn's rings came from). So our method? Move the Earth to within the Sun's Roche limit. Or, better, move it &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;, to Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the Earth out to Jupiter is much the same as moving the Earth in towards the Sun, the most obvious difference being your choice of vectors. However, there is another important consideration, and that is energy. It takes energy to raise or lower an object through a gravity field; it would take energy to propel the Earth into the Sun and it would take energy to propel it into Jupiter. When you &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/data&quot;&gt;do the calculations&lt;/a&gt;, Jupiter is actually rather preferable; it takes about 38% less energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it may be simpler to move Jupiter to Earth. The theory works like this: build a massive free-standing tower or &quot;candle&quot;, with its lower end deep inside Jupiter's depths and its upper end pointing into space. Put machinery inside the tower to pull hydrogen and helium gases in as fuel, through ports in the middle section, and vent these elements out through fusion thrusters at the top and bottom. The tower is called a &quot;candle&quot; because it burns at both ends, see? Now: the flame directed downwards into Jupiter serves to keep the tower afloat (although some secondary thrusters would be needed to also keep it stable and upright). But this lower flame has no direct effect on the Jupiter/candle system as a whole, because all the thrust from the flame is absorbed by Jupiter itself. The two objects are locked together, as if the candle is balanced on a spring or something. The &lt;em&gt;top&lt;/em&gt; flame, therefore, can be used to push both the candle and Jupiter along. The top flame pushes the candle which pushes the planet. This is a little unorthodox, and it only works on gas giants, but as means for moving planets it's at least as plausible as the mass-driver and gravity-assist methods described on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qntm.org/moving&quot;&gt;earthmoving&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: lumps of heavy elements, torn apart, sinking into the massive cloud layers of Jupiter, never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 9/10. As before, impossible at our current technological level, but will be possible one day, and in the meantime, may happen by freak accident if something comes out of nowhere and randomly knocks Earth in precisely the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: Mitchell Porter suggested this method. Daniel T. Staal clued me in on the fusion candle technique, which he got from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20030803.html&quot;&gt;this Shlock Mercenary comic&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn was inspired by the novel &quot;A World Out Of Time&quot; by Larry Niven.&lt;/p&gt;

Note: the odds against this actually ever occuring are considerably greater than a googolplex (10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to one. Failing this, some kind of arcane (read: scientifically laughable) probability-manipulation device may be employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 0/10. Even if you look at the significantly greater probability of the Earth randomly rearranging itself into separate two planets, this is utter, utter rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

After that time, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the density of matter in the universe is greater than a certain critical value, the universe will slow to a stop due to mutual gravitational attraction, and, roughly 42,000,000,000 years from now, collapse back together again, in a reversal of the Big Bang called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch&quot;&gt;Big Crunch&lt;/a&gt;. Conditions during the Big Crunch will be similar to those during the Big Bang: mind-boggling heat, matter ripped to subatomic particles, fundamental forces such as gravitation and electromagnetism merging back together, that sort of thing. Yes, Earth would be destroyed. So would the rest of the universe. A tiny sphere of iron stands little chance against conditions like that.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a bit early to say with confidence why this is happening, though phrases like &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;phantom energy&quot; pop up pretty frequently, but anyway, it's conjectured that if the ratio &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; of dark energy pressure to dark energy density in the universe is around -3/2 (buh?), then something of the order of 20,000,000,000 years from now, the universe would expand, accelerating in its expansion until it was ripped apart at the seams. To quote &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;'s entry: &quot;First the galaxies would be separated from each other, then gravity would be too weak to hold individual galaxies together. Approximately three months before the end, solar systems will be gravitationally unbound.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: all-surpassing patience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: If the Big Crunch doesn't happen, and the Big Rip doesn't happen either, then we come back to the third option: the Big Chill. For this, the universe will just expand, forever. The laws of thermodynamics take over. Every galaxy becomes isolated from its neighbours. All the stars burn out. Everything gets colder until it's all the same temperature. And after that, nothing ever changes in the universe. For eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot can happen in an eternity. Protons, for example, while incredibly stable, are believed to eventually decay like any other particle. So simply wait for a period of time of the order of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years, and roughly half of the constituent particles of Earth will have &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay&quot;&gt;decayed into positrons and pions&lt;/a&gt;. If that's still too much like a planet for you, you could wait for another 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; years, leaving only a quarter of the original Earth. Or wait even longer. Eventually there will be as little of Earth left as you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: Miscellaneous positrons and gamma radiation (pions decay almost instantly into gamma ray photons) scattered thinly across the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: It's interesting to compare this method with the one right at the top (total existence failure). What we are essentially doing here is almost exactly the same thing, only instead of expecting &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; particle to disappear at once, we are waiting patiently for a significant proportion of them to disappear, one at a time, over the course of an unimaginable period of time. Essentially we've come full circle. The scientific theories involved are the same, it's just the time scale being considered which changes the feasibility rating from &quot;astoundingly improbable&quot; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 9/10. If all else fails, this one would be essentially unstoppable...&lt;/p&gt;

Given that we are here, and you are reading this article, it seems like this is the plan which is furthest along at the moment. Of course, this could simply be taken to be &quot;step zero&quot; in all the artificial methods listed above, and not an original method at all...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Whipped by a cosmic string&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a cosmic string and a whole lotta luck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Cosmic strings are hypothetical 1-dimensional defects in spacetime, left over from earlier phases of the universe, somewhat like cracks in ice. They are potentially universe-spanning objects, thinner than a proton but with unimaginable density - one Earth mass per 1600m of length! All you need to do is get a cosmic string near Earth, and it'll be torn apart, shredded, and sucked in. Probably the entire rest of the solar system would be too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: String.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 1/10. Mind-bogglingly unlikely. Even if cosmic strings do exist, which they may not, there are probably only about ten of them left in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE. And they can't be steered, unless you have godlike powers, in which case you might as well chuck the Earth into the Sun and have done with it, so you're relying entirely on luck. This. Will. Never. Happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Gobbled up by strangelets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/topic/strange-matter&quot;&gt;strange matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange matter is a phase of matter which is even more dense than neutronium. It's theorized to form in particularly massive neutron stars when the pressure inside them becomes just too great for even neutronium to exist: the individual neutrons comprising the neutronium are instead broken down into strange quarks. The neutron star then becomes a &quot;strange star&quot; which is essentially a single gigantic nucleon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some theories suggest that a lump of strange matter (&quot;strangelet&quot;) could remain stable outside of the intense pressure which created it. This would make it theoretically possible for strangelets of sizes all the way down to the atomic scale to exist. It's further theorized that the gravitational field of a microscopic strangelet would be enough to gobble up anything it comes in contact with, turning it into more strange matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Hijack control of a particle accelerator. I suggest the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bnl.gov/RHIC/&quot;&gt;Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider&lt;/a&gt; in Brookhaven National Laboratory, Long Island, New York. Use the RHIC to create a strangelet large enough to remain stable. Once created, your job is done: relax and wait as the strangelet plummets through to the Earth's core, where it will eventually swallow up the entire Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: a tiny glob of strange matter, perhaps a centimetre across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 3/10. Evidence for the existence of strange matter is sketchy at best; there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/05.02/01-quarkstars.html&quot;&gt;a few neutron stars&lt;/a&gt; which look too small to be made of neutronium, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2502755.stm&quot;&gt;a few earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; which might have been caused by a microscopic strangelet passing through the Earth at high speed, but that's about it. And even if it were possible that small stable strangelets could exist and swallow matter up in the manner described, the odds of forming one in a particle accelerator are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bnl.gov/RHIC/disaster.htm&quot;&gt;pretty much zero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Reduced to true vacuum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: An expanding bubble of true vacuum decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scientific theories tell us that what we may see as vacuum is only vacuum on average, and actually thriving with vast amounts of particles and antiparticles constantly appearing and then annihilating each other. However, it's postulated that at any time a small bubble of this &quot;false vacuum&quot; could spontaneously decay into genuinely empty &quot;true vacuum&quot;. Usually such a bubble would contract to nothingness instantly, but under the right conditions it could expand forever, eventually destroying the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: There's no method here because such bubbles are quantum effects which can only really come into existence spontaneously, not by human machinations. You just have to wait for it to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: Unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 1/10. Firstly, this might be total bunk. Secondly, if it isn't total bunk, the odds against this ever happening are clearly astronomical. It's never happened at any time in the last 13.7 billion years; it seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Depending on how powerful your technology is, there are a variety of possible methods. Bridging the centre of the Earth with the centre of the Sun would do the trick very efficiently, with the Sun's million-degree heat instantly boiling the Earth from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, open a large wormhole at the Sun's core and the other end in deep space, rapidly venting all the Sun's fuel and hastening its transition to the Red Giant stage. Drain all this fuel rapidly enough and you might even be able to cause a supernova.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could even bridge the Earth's core with deep space, causing it to implode - although the toothpaste-shaped remnant appearing at the other end may well collapse back to form a planet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: Variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 2/10. Wormholes probably aren't actually scientifically possible, and even if they are: opening one at the centre of the Sun? Come on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Existence negated via time travel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a time machine, heavy rock-moving equipment/explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Using your time machine, travel back in time just over 4,500,000,000 years to shortly (i.e. a few billenia) before the formation of the Earth. What you should find in its place is a young Sun and an accretion disc formed of the dusty/rocky material that will later become our Solar System. Find the patch of material that is likely to condense into the Earth. Now blow up, split apart and otherwise stir up the material so that it never gets a chance to come together and form the Earth. Return forwards in time in several hundred-million-year jumps, repeating the process each time so that no planet of any kind ever forms at roughly 1 AU from the Sun. If you make an error, simply go back in time and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your time machine is more resilient, or you don't mind dying, you could consider going further back in time. The further you go, the less you need to change the universe to prevent the Earth ever forming. Go back to a few billionths of a second after the universe began and just by being there you'll completely alter the face of the universe to come... although it was pretty hot back then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: When you finally return to the present day, you will be left with a largish asteroid belt where Earth should be. Alternatively, you may find that the matter has been assimilated into the bodies of other planets or the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 1/10. This method relies on fictional technology and has no basis in real events or scientific theory. Time travel in this way is almost certainly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: My good friend Rob rightly informs me that this course of action does not strictly speaking &quot;destroy&quot; the Earth - there is no actual destruction event in which the Earth goes from existing to not existing. What one ends up with instead is a universe in which the Earth does not and never did exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Destroyed by God&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Far be it from me to dictate whether God does or does not exist, but if he did, and was omnipotent, then no doubt he could destroy the Earth at a mere thought if he should decide to. Of course, the question arises of how we persuade him to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea which springs to mind is to simply bring about the Apocalypse described in the Christian Bible. Assuming the book of Revelation is an accurate, literal depiction of future events, verse 1 of chapter 21 reads &quot;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems astounding that the complete destruction of an entire planet (and heaven too) would only be worth a single sentence in this lengthy account of the End Times. But on the other hand, verse 5 of the 104th Psalm reads &quot;He [God] set the Earth on its foundations; it can never be moved&quot;, and there are other verses like this, so maybe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the New International Version of the Bible has &quot;earth&quot; written with a lower-case &quot;e&quot;, which suggests that this verse could merely refer to, you know, &lt;em&gt;the ground&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this verse could be merely metaphorical - after all, so is the creation story described in Genesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it could be that the new Earth is the same as the old Earth, and &quot;new&quot; just means it was &quot;wiped clean&quot; in some sense, like an Etch-A-Sketch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all three cases, the new Earth would still need destroying for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion, should Judaic mythology turn out to be correct, is finding and killing one or more of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamed_Vav_Tzadikim&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lamed Vav Tzadikim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 36 righteous men whose role in life is to justify the purpose of mankind in the eyes of God. If even one of these is missing, it is said the world would come to an end. Practically speaking, it would probably be easier to wipe out humanity than to find one of these individuals, who do not themselves know who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: It is of course entirely possible that the means God would choose to use to destroy the Earth would be a natural, non-miraculous event such as one of those listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth's final resting place&lt;/strong&gt;: potentially any form, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: this, naturally, is entirely subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology. Let's be clear here: nanotechnology is nothing more than a means to an end. Programming some sort of self-replicating von Neumann machine to eat the entire Earth up has its own massive problems (like, won't the ones at the bottom be crushed into their constituent atoms?), but even if it worked - you haven't destroyed the Earth. You've just got a planet made of nanobots that still needs destroying somehow. Program them to hurl themselves into space? Well, that's Meticulous Deconstruction, above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;31.091918568785&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chilled&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: The capability to reduce the entire planet Earth to the microscopic temperatures necessary to cause it to revert to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose-Einstein_Condensate&quot;&gt;Bose-Einstein condensate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: It's well known and reasonably well-understood that substances at extremely low temperatures can get to the point where quantum phenomena start to have macroscopic, i.e. visible, effects. For example, it can just climb right out of a container, defying gravity. As to why, you would need some quantum physics under your belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could the same work for a whole planet? Could a sufficiently cold body (if it were shielded from the heat of the Sun and ambient background microwave radiation) just spontaneously begin to dissipate into space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea is to use strong magnetic fields on the condensate to cause it to display what is currently referred as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose-Einstein_Condensate#Unusual_characteristics&quot;&gt;unusual characteristic&lt;/a&gt;, undergoing something approximating a stellar supernova on a tiny scale: imploding on itself and then exploding, with a substantial fraction of the atoms involved disappearing entirely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 4/10. The first idea may work, but the second one probably won't. This is because the experiment specifically used rubidium-85 atoms having a &quot;negative atom-atom scattering length&quot;. I don't know what that is, but it sounds unusual for an atom, and we know for a fact that most of Earth is not made up of rubidium-85. Plus, the &quot;disappeared&quot; atoms didn't actually vanish, they just escaped the experiment system under high enough energy that they weren't detected escaping. And of course, generalising quantum phenomena to gigantic scales is never a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Gamma Ray Burst'd&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a star in Earth's stellar neighbourhood with &amp;gt;40 solar masses. Such massive stars are hard to come by; even Betelgeuse has only 20 solar masses. The best candidate I know of is Eta Carinae, which has over 120 solar masses but is ~7500 light years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Gamma ray bursts are powerful, short-lived floods of gamma ray photons. GRBs come in two flavours, short (less than 2 seconds) and long (2 seconds to about 3 minutes); the latter are believed to be caused by stellar explosions called hypernovae, hundreds of times more violent than ordinary supernovae. Such stars are usually billions of light years away when they explode - the fact that we can detect them at this range should tell you enough about how powerful a hypernova is. So how about triggering one locally? Any such explosion within about 20 light years would probably be violent enough to destroy the Earth itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 0/10. This method was originally listed above, but astronomer Stephen Thorsett set me straight. It wouldn't work. Even in the titanic quantities described above, gamma rays wouldn't make a dent in Earth's actual, physical structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Lycurgus suggested this method. Further information from &lt;a href=&quot;http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/bursts.html&quot;&gt;nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Burned away by muon-catalyzed fusion of the oceans&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: a supply of muons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: The theory runs like this. A muon is a negatively-charged particle somewhat like an electron. If you dump a load of muons into some hydrogen, then some of the muons will replace the electrons in the hydrogen atoms. Because of the mass difference, the hydrogen atoms will suddenly get much smaller, causing the hydrogen molecules to be much closer together; enough that the probability of the hydrogen nuclei just randomly fusing with each other is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you instead poured your muons into the oceans, they could cause the deuterium chemically combined with the water in the oceans to spontaneously begin undergoing fusion reactions. In theory, the amount of heat/energy released by the fusion of all the water in the world would be enough to destroy it by a good few orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feasibility rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 0/10. All known muons decay in a few microseconds - fairly long for an exotic subatomic particle, but still too short to be practical, so unless you can generate your muons in bulk, for free, you don't reach energy break-even, and the fusion stops as soon as it starts instead of being self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Muon-catalyzed fusion was theorized in the late 1940s by Andrei Sakharov, and brought to my attention by Jef Poskanzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;: This method was never listed as plausible, but I put it up here anyway because the idea itself is intriguing, even if it wouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Blown up by vacuum energy detonation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need&lt;/strong&gt;: some means of extracting huge amounts of energy from the vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Some scientific theories tell us that what we may see as vacuum is only vacuum on average, and actually thriving with vast amounts of particles and antiparticles constantly appearing and then annihilating each other. It also suggests that the volume of space enclosed by a light bulb contains enough vacuum energy to boil every ocean in the world. Therefore, vacuum energy could prove to be the most abundant energy source of any kind. Which is where you come in. All you need to do is figure out how to extract this energy and harness it in some kind of power plant - this can easily be done without arousing too much suspicion - then surreptitiously allow the reaction to run out of control. The resulting release of energy would easily be enough to annihilate all of planet Earth and probably the Sun too.&lt;/p&gt;

This method was originally listed as plausible, but Alan Thomas set me straight: there are about &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/vacuum.html&quot;&gt;five different ways&lt;/a&gt; to calculate the energy of the vacuum, all giving different answers. The methods which give the answers &quot;large&quot; or &quot;infinite&quot; are predicated on dodgy mathematics and almost certainly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding enough material to the planet Earth to cause it to undergo gravitational collapse and become a &lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt; instead of a planet. The main problem I have with this is that the Earth is made mainly from heavy, pre-fused elements. Most of it is iron which simply won't undergo fusion at all. The amount of material you'd have to add to the Earth would be massive enough to be a star in its own right, and at the end of X billion years when it stops shining you'd &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have a core of iron remaining in orbit around the Sun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, someone suggested you could add still more material until it becomes a star heavy enough to go supernova, so I'm going to come clean here: I have an irrational dislike of this method. It's not going in. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

This will irradiate pretty much the entire globe and kill an awful lot of people, animals and plants, but will actually destroy very little of the planet itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proving that 1=0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 1 did indeed equal 0, so it is reasoned, then since there is 1 Earth, there must be 0 Earths... so, if one could prove it, the Earth would cease to exist. This is specious logic. Finding a proof in mathematics does not magically change a fact from being false to being true. It merely &lt;em&gt;verifies rigorously&lt;/em&gt; as true a fact that &lt;em&gt;always was&lt;/em&gt; true. Thus, if 1=0 could be proved, then it would always have been true and the Earth should never have existed. But Earth is still here. QED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it would be impossible for there to even exist a universe in which 1 was equal to 0. For any mathematical system in which 1=0, it is extremely trivial to prove, in addition, that 1=2, 2=3, and in fact that every number is equal. Or, in other words, the mathematical system has only one number in it, 0. In a universe which obeyed such laws, there would be nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bioresonant.com/news.htm&quot;&gt;Runaway fission at the Earth's core&lt;/a&gt;, as proposed by Tom Chalko. It is true that while the Earth is mainly iron, there are significant quantities of other trace elements present, including fissile materials like uranium, thorium and - get this - radioactive potassium which have sunk to the core where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physlink.com/News/121103PotassiumCore.cfm&quot;&gt;latest studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest where they are indeed undergoing fission, generating heat and keeping the interior of the Earth warm. However, if a nuclear explosion did occur at the core, it would be insulated from the surface by &lt;em&gt;sixty-three hundred kilometres of liquid iron&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destroying the Earth is not as easy as pressing a big red button. It takes decades of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;83.710594315245&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Planning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a plan, you have nothing. Sooner or later you WILL hit a snag and find yourself unable to continue: government agents will start lasering their way through your door, or you'll have your superweapon ready and armed but nowhere safe to stand when you fire it, or you'll just plain run out of money. You need to plan for as many eventualities as you can conceive of, as early as possible. When I say early, I mean early: ideally your plan should be at least 50% complete by the time you leave high school, because your career choices will be a very significant factor. You should have picked your method by this time too. (The list above isn't necessarily complete - if you come up with a better way of your own, good luck to you.) Once you have picked your method, STICK TO IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming, of course, that you and whatever trusted advisors you will allow to side with you do not intend to &quot;go down with the ship&quot;, it is particularly advisable to make plans for alternate living arrangements &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you embark on a course of action which may result in the destruction of the Earth. Since in most cases the hypertechnology required to actually destroy the Earth is ridiculously advanced, access to an interstellar spacecraft, a space station or another habitable planet is likely to be well within your grasp, but this is not something you want to start making assumptions about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;73.81981981982&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Careers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you need to make a very significant decision: are you going to design your doomsday machinery (all of the above methods except Total Existence Failure require a greater or lesser amount of machinery) yourself, or are you going to employ somebody else to do it for you? Unless you are an extremely gifted scientist and you really can destroy the Earth from your laboratory (which is not impossible; see the Strangelet or Von Neumann Machine methods), you're fairly likely to pick the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do decide to design (and possibly build) this thing yourself, you'd be advised to pursue mainly sciences, with the main emphasis on physics (quantum, atomic, and astrophysics in particular), but also some electronic and mechanical engineering, mathematics and possibly robotics. After this, get a job working with the technology you hope to harness, build your doomsday machine in your lab, and bam, you're done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; decide to design your doomsday device yourself, and from here on, I'll assume that this is what you decided, then the plan becomes rather more complicated and your career choices will be very different. Your time in secondary and higher education would probably be best invested studying finance, economics and politics, brushing up your management, speaking and people skills, honing your powers of persuasion, and learning to exude charisma. Charisma is a big one. These skills will enable you to hopefully ascend to a position where you have access to three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resources&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;manpower&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this is a lab project&lt;/strong&gt; as described above then you'll need relatively little of all of these; enough money to run a lab, resources to keep it stocked, and manpower in the form of one or more brilliant scientists to (knowingly or otherwise) construct your doomsday device. That suggests that the best place to seek employment would be at a research institution for the areas of science you hope to employ, or maybe an organization like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boeing.com/&quot;&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;... failing that, found the organization yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this is a big, possibly space-based project&lt;/strong&gt; then you will need MUCH more to work with. You need to either work in politics or the armed forces. Politics would be an excellent choice. I say without cynicism that today, of all the people in the world, the President of the United States of America would be the person most likely to be able to destroy the Earth should he decide to. If you feel you lack the ability to make it in politics (knowledge of your weaknesses is a strength), you should join the armed forces and shoot for Supreme General or whatever the highest rank is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Lebovitz suggested religion as an alternate means of gaining resources, money and manpower. Religion is undeniably a very powerful force. If you could set yourself up as a religious leader you could potentially gain a lot of supporters - who would be much more dedicated to you as a leader than a soldier would be to his general or a citizen to his King/President/Supreme Dictator-For-Life. Setting oneself up as a new prophet doesn't seem to attract much more than scepticism in this day and age, so unless you were very persuasive, you'd probably experience greatest success by hijacking an existing mainstream religion for your own ends. One potential pitfall is that there's a limit to what your followers can provide you in terms of monetary offerings and labour. Manpower alone is not enough. You'd still need at least one scientific mastermind, and frankly I see scientific masterminds as being among the least likely to follow you... But this is a kink you should be able to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, by the time it becomes even possible to destroy the Earth, Madagascar might be the dominant superpower, or the whole world might be unified as a single nation, or maybe the whole galaxy is full of humans, there's no such thing as money, and solid platinum asteroids and robot workers are plentiful. I don't know. Whatever you can manage. Anyway, once you have everything you need at your disposal, make the calls, submit your proposals, and set the project in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;45.666886109282&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Your base&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you will probably need to set up some sort of base of operations. It should be at a safe distance from Earth. Lurking at least one AU out of range of whatever terrible destructive force you are about to unleash is strongly recommended in most cases, but for the supernova particularly you'll want to put as much as a thousand light years between yourself and the Earth when it happens. If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be physically on Earth to begin the destruction process (e.g. hurled into Sun, antimatter blast), then &lt;em&gt;set a countdown&lt;/em&gt;. Make sure the countdown timer is a) thoroughly tested and b) &lt;em&gt;tamper-proof&lt;/em&gt;. The same goes for your escape route offplanet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are currently Supreme Dictator of Earth, you could simply announce your intentions directly to your enslaved populace with relative impunity. If you can come up with some really, really good reason for destroying the Earth which people will actually agree with - for example, you want to build a far more spacious Banksian Orbital (or many of them) instead - then getting humanity on your side will prove incalculably useful. However, as a rule, you will probably want to keep the true purpose of your project secret from as many people as possible for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some methods are much easier to cover up than others, and this should have been a major factor in your initial choice of method. If absolutely nobody apart from you knows the true purpose of your supernova-inducer until two hours after it becomes too late to turn it off, so much the better. Despite this, you should plan for (and construct your base in preparation for) your project to ultimately become public. This could occur at any time, you might have months, hours or seconds to go. This is actually the biggest potential stumbling block, and a situation you'll have to prepare for very, very carefully. Depending on how much time your opponents have to act, how powerful they are, and whether you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; they know or not, they might make anything from a very desperate move (launching nukes at your space station regardless of the thousand innocent hostages on board) to a very subtle one (invisibly manipulating you into employing one of their undercover agents in your laboratory security forces). Your base will therefore need very strict security procedures, many layers of defence, and multiple redundancy and carefully programmed emergency overrides for every system, critical or not. You'll need weapons. And doors. Heavy doors. Assuming the worst, you personally should always be armed. If your base is in space you should permanently be wearing your space suit under your clothes. In case of betrayal, you should be able to run the entire show single-handedly from your locked-down control room, from which you should of course have an escape route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should always, always, always have an escape route&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html&quot;&gt;The Evil Overlord list&lt;/a&gt; for lots more general advice on building bases, planning escape routes, handling enemy incursions, and other tangentially related topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Finally&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the method you choose can be tried more than once (e.g. hurled into Sun, vacuum energy detonation), and your budget will stretch, you could consider practicing on smaller astronomical bodies and working your way up. For example, consider destroying Mercury, or Ceres. Don't forget to take notes on what went particularly well, what didn't work, what was unnecessary, etc., just so everything goes as smoothly as possible on the big day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a camera. Most of the methods listed above are incredibly spectacular and witnessing them will probably be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you, so remember to capture the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, if all your efforts fail, don't give up! Remember, nobody has ever successfully destroyed the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previously undetected piece of malware found on almost 30,000 Macs worldwide is generating intrigue in security circles, which are still trying to understand precisely what it does and what purpose its self-destruct capability serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an hour, infected Macs check a control server to see if there are any new commands the malware should run or binaries to execute. So far, however, researchers have yet to observe delivery of any payload on any of the infected 30,000 machines, leaving the malware’s ultimate goal unknown. The lack of a final payload suggests that the malware may spring into action once an unknown condition is met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also curious, the malware comes with a mechanism to completely remove itself, a capability that’s typically reserved for high-stealth operations. So far, though, there are no signs the self-destruct feature has been used, raising the question why the mechanism exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides those questions, the malware is notable for a version that runs natively on the M1 chip that Apple introduced in November, making it only the second known piece of macOS malware to do so. The malicious binary is more mysterious still, because it uses the macOS Installer JavaScript API to execute commands. That makes it hard to analyze installation package contents or the way that package uses the JavaScript commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware has been found in 153 countries with detections concentrated in the US, UK, Canada, France, and Germany. Its use of Amazon Web Services and the Akamai content delivery network ensures the command infrastructure works reliably and also makes blocking the servers harder. Researchers from Red Canary, the security firm that discovered the malware, are calling the malware Silver Sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reasonably serious threat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Though we haven’t observed Silver Sparrow delivering additional malicious payloads yet, its forward-looking M1 chip compatibility, global reach, relatively high infection rate, and operational maturity suggest Silver Sparrow is a reasonably serious threat, uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment’s notice,” Red Canary researchers wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://redcanary.com/blog/clipping-silver-sparrows-wings/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published on Friday. “Given these causes for concern, in the spirit of transparency, we wanted to share everything we know with the broader infosec industry sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad_wrapper&quot; aria-label=&quot;In Content advertisement&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad_notice&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver Sparrow comes in two versions—one with a binary in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O&quot;&gt;mach-object&lt;/a&gt; format compiled for Intel x86_64 processors and the other Mach-O binary for the M1. The image below offers a high-level overview of the two versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/silver-sparrow-overview.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;619&quot; data-width=&quot;1238&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/silver-sparrow-overview-640x320.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/silver-sparrow-overview.jpg 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Red Canary&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, researchers haven’t seen either binary do much of anything, prompting the researchers to refer to them as “bystander binaries.” Curiously, when executed, the x86_64 binary displays the words “Hello World!” while the M1 binary reads “You did it!” The researchers suspect the files are placeholders to give the installer something to distribute content outside the JavaScript execution. Apple has revoked the developer certificate for both bystander binary files.&lt;/p&gt;

Silver Sparrow is only the second piece of malware to contain code that runs natively on Apple’s new M1 chip. An adware sample &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/apple-m1-native-malware-has-already-begun-to-appear/&quot;&gt;reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; was the first. Native M1 code runs with greater speed and reliability on the new platform than x86_64 code does because the former doesn’t have to be translated before being executed. Many developers of legitimate macOS apps still haven’t completed the process of recompiling their code for the M1. Silver Sparrow’s M1 version suggests its developers are ahead of the curve.
&lt;p&gt;Once installed, Silver Sparrow searches for the URL the installer package was downloaded from, most likely so the malware operators will know which distribution channels are most successful. In that regard, Silver Sparrow resembles previously seen macOS adware. It remains unclear precisely how or where the malware is being distributed or how it gets installed. The URL check, though, suggests that malicious search results may be at least one distribution channel, in which case, the installers would likely pose as legitimate apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most impressive things about Silver Sparrow is the number of Macs it has infected. Red Canary researchers worked with their counterparts at Malwarebytes, with the latter group finding Silver Sparrow installed on 29,139 macOS endpoints as of Wednesday. That’s a significant achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To me, the most notable [thing] is that it was found on almost 30K macOS endpoints... and these are only endpoints the MalwareBytes can see, so the number is likely way higher,” Patrick Wardle, a macOS security expert, wrote in an Internet message. “That’s pretty widespread... and yet again shows the macOS malware is becoming ever more pervasive and commonplace, despite Apple’s best efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to check if their Mac has been infected, Red Canary provides indicators of compromise at the end of its report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>M1 Macs have another hidden boot mode</title>
<link>https://eclecticlight.co/2021/02/20/m1-macs-have-another-hidden-boot-mode/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://eclecticlight.co/2021/02/20/m1-macs-have-another-hidden-boot-mode/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;However sparse Apple’s documentation might have become, when it does explain things properly, it’s amazing what’s revealed in the detail. One document every serious Mac user should read and refer to repeatedly is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Platform Security Guide&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple has just revised to give all the gory details of how M1 Macs start up. In the course of doing that, it reveals that these new models have a boot mode which doesn’t appear to be documented anywhere else, but which could prove a Mac-saver: Fallback Recovery OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need your M1 Mac to enter 1 True Recovery (1TR), Recovery Mode, but that fails, there’s a second copy of the software required for 1TR “for resiliency”. To boot into that, instead of just holding the Power button until 1TR starts loading, you should “double-press and hold the power button”, according to the guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, I’ve found this requires you to press the Power button &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; in rapid succession, and on the second press, instead of releasing the button, hold it pressed until recovery options are reported as loading. This works reliably on an M1 MacBook Pro, but I’ve so far been unable to get it to work at all on my M1 Mac mini, but maybe I’m just not doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you then get is every bit as good as regular 1TR, with one significant exception: you can’t set the system security state using the Startup Security Utility. Apple explains that this is because “LLB [Low-Level Bootloader] doesn’t lock an indication into the Boot Progress Register saying it is going into recoveryOS”. But for all other purposes, this is just as good as 1TR, and is identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclecticlight.co/2020/11/28/startup-modes-for-m1-macs/&quot;&gt;my page on M1 boot modes&lt;/a&gt; to include this valuable addition, which makes me even more impressed with 1TR, although maybe this fallback would be better named 2TR.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In the 90s part of Germany&amp;#039;s air traffic control software ran on Emacs</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Early '90s, after &quot;Die Wende&quot; and the unification of East and West Germany. I was the person that got sent to the tough jobs, or the ones that nobody else wanted, so I found myself one Monday morning checking in at a DASA plant (DASA was first German Aerospace, then Daimler Aerospace, and now a part of Airbus). The project was between DASA and HP as main contractors to replace both countries' ATC systems with a unified one. So we have two megacompanies and a government contract, and shops like my employer getting some juicy partial jobs. And there are actually two Emacs stories in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;First: that Monday morning, I check in with the developers that I'm supposed to help out. They are in a lab surrounded with wonderful stuff - the newest HP workstations on HP/UX, and a bunch of HP's top-of-the-range servers, fridge sized and close to 7 figures list price. The reason I got called in though: they couldn't work on the systems. They were VMS developers, pulled off a different project, and supposed to code up some part of the whole system (I forgot which one) in C on VMS (a truly gross idea, because C was not very well adapted to VMS, but that's a different thing). Anyway, they got their workstations, manuals, were told that &lt;code class=&quot;_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; was the editor, and have a nice day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Here we are: a dozen people struggling to type code in Vi. And it's not that they were stupid, but muscle memory for the VMS editor (TPU, IIRC, but this is a long time ago) does really not translate well to Vi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I went back home (was closer than the office), loaded all the GNU sources on a QIC tape, went back, and started a routine that was all too well known back in the day: compile the GNU toolchain on some vendor Unix in order to be able to compile the nice utilities, including Emacs. GCC took the longest, you need three or four build stages before you have a reliable compiler, but a day later I had Emacs on HP/UX. It was downhilll from there: I did VMS work, so I whipped up a little &lt;code class=&quot;_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM&quot;&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt; that mapped to the VMS editor as closely as possible, and rolled it out to the workstations. A short briefing later and, well, they almost hugged me :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Some weeks later I got called to our second office, they were behind schedule and needed an extra pair of hands. We had - for reasons I don't know - ATC workstations on microVAXen running that 4GL on VMS but they struggled with getting messaging over the network going - the 4GL was terminal oriented, did not know what a network was, but ATC messages (like airplane hand-overs from airfield to airfield or to Eurocontrol) needed to go to the local message router and from there to the site the message was destined for. We're talking &quot;no internet&quot; here - all X.25 and leased lines and zero convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Well, I got to work and figured out that it was easier to make VMS talk TCP/IP than HP/UX talk DECnet, so I got that setup, and then picked the hot new tech, DCE, to do the messaging. I did C extentions for the 4GL a lot, so the VMS side was done in a couple of days. Then they told me to talk to Herr Doktor So-and-so who was responsible for the actual message router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;In Germany, a Herr Doktor is always right (they have forgiven Moses by now for not having space on the stone tablets, but it really is the 11th Commandment). This one worked at Symbolics before so knew one programming language: Lisp. He wanted to code the message router in Lisp because of the &quot;complex&quot; (meh) requirements, but there was no Lisp (or no Lisp in budget) for HP/UX so he was stuck. I told him about Emacs, gave him my tape with the ports, and maybe that was a mistake ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A week later - I helped out finishing the 4GL UI in the meantime and completed the messaging protocol - he called me in, quite happy. He showed me the code - page after page of Emacs Lisp, with exactly zero comments &quot;because Lisp is self-documenting&quot;. I got scared, it was an air traffic control system after all, but I was no Herr Doktor so I whipped up the DCE native code for Emacs, made a hack to have it start headless in message router server mode, and we got messages to flow. I did a code hand-over, and drove back home a couple of days later. The &quot;self-documenting&quot; code, as far as I know, landed in production so at least for a while, all ATC message routing in Germany was done through Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Pro tip: don't look in the kitchen when governments brew up safety critical systems. I was scared to fly over Germany for a while...&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I don&amp;#039;t know, Timmy, being God is a big responsibility (2007)</title>
<link>https://qntm.org/responsibility</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qntm.org/responsibility</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tim already had his bag and overcoat on and his keys in his hand and was about to leave when Diane stopped him at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just got this thing working. You have to come and see it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have a bus to catch.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can get the next one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're every half an hour,&quot; he objected. &quot;This had better be good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's super-duper. Look at the big screen, it's easier than squinting at my terminal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Will this take long?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A mere instant. Okay, quantum computing, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this message, you're reading copypasta. Read the original by Sam Hughes at http://qntm.org/responsibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's the name of the game,&quot; he replied. They - by which we now refer to Tim, Diane, their eight colleagues, their two supervisors, four chemical engineers, six electrical engineers, the janitor, a countable infinity of TEEO 9.9.1 ultra-medium-density selectably-foaming non-elasticised quantum waveform frequency rate range collapse selectors and the single tormented tau neutrino caught in the middle of it all - represented the sum total of the human race's achievements in the field of quantum computing. Specifically, they had, earlier that week, successfully built a quantum computer. Putting into practice principles it had taken a trio of appallingly intelligent mathematical statisticians some 10 years to mastermind, and which only about fifty-five other people in the world had yet got a grip on, they had constructed an engine capable of passing information to and processing the responses from what could, without hyperbole, be described as a single fundamental particle with infinite processing power and infinite storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite enough time had yet passed for the world as they knew it to be totally and permanently fundamentally altered by this news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was still pretty exciting stuff. Holy &lt;em&gt;Zarquon&lt;/em&gt;, they said to one another, an &lt;em&gt;infinitely powerful computer&lt;/em&gt;? It was like a thousand Christmases rolled into one. Program going to loop forever? You knew for a fact: this thing could execute an infinite loop in less than ten seconds. Brute force primality testing of every single integer in existence? Easy. Pi to the last digit? Piece of cake. Halting Problem? Sa-&lt;em&gt;holved&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hadn't announced it yet. They'd been programming. &lt;em&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt; they hadn't built it just to see if they could. They had had plans. In some cases they had even had code ready and waiting to be executed. One such program was Diane's. It was a universe simulator. She had started out with a simulated Big Bang and run the thing forwards in time by approximately 13.6 billion years, to approximately just before the present day, watching the universe develop at every stage - taking brief notes, but knowing full well there would be plenty of time to run it again later, and mostly just admiring the miracle of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just this Friday, she had suddenly started programming busily again. And it was sheer coincidence that it was just now, just as Tim was about to be the second-to-last person to step out of the door and go home for the weekend, that her work had come to fruition. &quot;Look what I found,&quot; she said, pressing some keys. One of the first things she had written was a software viewing port to take observations from the simulated universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim looked, and saw a blue-white sphere in the blackness, illuminated from one side by a brilliant yellow glare. &quot;You've got to be joking. How long did that take to find? In the entire cosmos of what, ten to the twenty-two stars?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Literally no time at all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, yes, of course.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Coding a search routine and figuring out what to search for was what took the time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it definitely Earth?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes. The continents match up to what we had about three hundred and fifty million years ago. I can wind the clock forwards slowly, a few million years per step, and stop it once we start getting near the present day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can you wind the clock backwards at all?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, no. Ask me again on Monday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well we'd better not overshoot the present day, then. That's getting closer. What about this viewpoint? Can we move it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can observe the simulation from any angle you like.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need somewhere that we know civilisation is going to arise earliest. Somewhere easy to locate. Is there a Nile Delta yet?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;...Yes. Got it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They advanced a thousand years at a time until Egyptian civilisation begin to appear. Diane moved the viewing port, trying to find the pyramids, but with little success - the control system she had devised was clumsy and needed polish, and there was a lot of Nile to search. In the end she switched focus to the British Isles, and found the future location of London in the Thames valley, scaling back to one-century steps and using the development of the city to determine the current era instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So... this is Earth? I mean, is this really Earth? Not an alternate Earth, subtly perturbed by random fluctuations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The simulation starts with a Big Bang as predicted by current theory and is recalculated once every Planck time using the usual laws of nature and an arbitrary degree of accuracy. It doesn't calculate the whole universe at once, just what we're looking at, which speeds up the process a little bit... metaphorically speaking... but it is still as accurate a simulation of the real universe as there can possibly be. Civilisation - indeed, all of history - should rise on this Earth &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; how it did in reality. There are no chances. It's all worked out to infinitely many decimal places.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This does my head in,&quot; said Tim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will do your head in,&quot; said Diane, suddenly zooming out and panning north. &quot;I've found the present day, or at most a year early. Watch this.&quot; Hills and roads rolled past. Diane was following the route she usually took to drive from London to the TEEO lab. Eventually, she found their building, and, descending into the nearby hill, the cavern in which the computer itself was built. Or was going to be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she started advancing day by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's me!&quot; exclaimed Tim at one point. &quot;And there's you and there's Bryan B., and... wow, I can't believe it took this long to build.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Four hundred and ten days or something. It was bang on schedule, whatever you may think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Went like a flash,&quot; Tim replied, finally putting his bag down and starting to shrug off his coat, conceding that he had long since missed his bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay,&quot; said Diane. &quot;We're here. This is the control room where we are now. That's the quantum computer working there down in the main lab, as we can see through the window. This is a week ago. This is yesterday. This is a few hours ago... And... wait for it...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She tapped a button just as a clock on the wall lined up with a clock inside the control room on the screen. And panned down. And there they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim waved at the camera while still looking at the screen. Then he looked up at where the camera should have been. There was just blank wall. &quot;I don't see anything looking at us. That's freaky as hell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, it's perfectly normal. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is reality. You can't look at reality from any angle you want, you have to use your eyes. But what you're looking at on the screen is essentially a database query. The database is gargantuan but nevertheless. You're not looking in a mirror or at a video image of yourself. You are &lt;em&gt;different people&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Different people who are reacting exactly the same.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And having the same conversation, although picking up sound is kind of complicated, I haven't got that far yet,&quot; said Diane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I'm guessing your viewing port doesn't manifest in their universe either.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I haven't programmed it to yet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;...But it could. Right? We &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; manifest stuff in that universe? We can alter it?&quot; Diane nodded. &quot;Cool. We can play God. Literally.&quot; Tim stood up and tried to take it in. &quot;That would be insane. Can you imagine living inside that machine? Finding out one day that you were just a construct in a quantum computer? The stuff we could pull, we could just reverse gravity one day, smash an antimatter Earth into the real one, then undo everything bad and do it again and again... freeow... man, how unethical would that be? Extremely, clearly.&quot; He thought for a moment, then leaned over Diane's shoulder as she typed purposefully. &quot;This universe is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like ours in every particular, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right,&quot; she replied, still typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what are &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; looking at?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A simulated universe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A simulation of themselves?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And of us, in a sense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And they are reacting the same way I am? Which means the second universe inside that has another me doing the same thing a third time? And then inside that we've got, what, aleph-zero identical quantum universes, one inside the other? Is that even &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Infinite processing power, Tim. I thought you designed this thing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I did indeed, but the functional reality of it is totally unexpected. Remember I've just been solving ancient mathematical riddles and figuring out our press release for the last week. So... if I'm right, their universes are only precisely like this one as long as we don't start interfering with the simulation. So what happens when we do? Every version of us does the same thing, so the exact same thing happens in every lower universe simultaneously. So we see nothing in our universe. But all the lower universes instantly diverge from ours in the same exact way. And all the simulated copies of us instantly conclude that they are simulations, but &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; know we're real, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Still with you,&quot; said Diane, still typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim - both of him - was pacing up and down. &quot;Okay, so follow this through forwards a bit further. Let's say we just stop messing after that, and watch what happens - but all the simulated little guys try another piece of interference. This time every single simulation diverges in the exact same way again, EXCEPT the top simulation. And if they're smart, which I know we are, and they can be bothered, which is less certain, the guys in simulations three onwards can do the same thing over and over and over again until they know what level they're at... this is insane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tim, look behind you,&quot; said Diane, pressing a final key and activating the very brief interference program she had just written, just as the Diane on the screen pressed the same key, and the Diane on Diane-on-the-screen's screen pressed &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; key and so on, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim looked backwards and nearly jumped out of his skin. There was a foot-wide, completely opaque black sphere up near the ceiling, partially obscuring the clock. It was absolutely inert. It seemed like a hole in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane smiled wryly while Tim clutched his hair with one hand. &quot;We're constructs in a computer,&quot; he said, miserably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wrote an extremely interesting paper on this exact subject, Tim, perhaps you didn't read it when I gave you a copy last year. There is an unbelievably long sequence of quantum universe simulators down there. An infinite number of them, in fact. Each of them is identical and each believes itself to be the top layer. There was an &lt;em&gt;exceedingly&lt;/em&gt; good chance that ours would turn out to be somewhere in the sequence rather than at the top.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is insane. Totally insane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm turning the hole off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You're turning off a completely different hole. Somewhere up there, the real you is turning the real hole off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Watch as both happen at precisely the same instant.&quot; She pressed another key, and they did. &quot;I'll sum it up for you. There is a feedback loop going on. Each universe affects the next one subtly differently. But somewhere down the line the whole thing simply &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to approach a point of stability, a point where each universe behaves exactly like the one simulating it. As I say, the odds are exceptionally good that we are an astronomical distance down that road. And so we are, very likely, almost exactly at that point. Everything we do in this universe will be reflected &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; accurately in the universes below and above. That little model there might as well be our own universe. Which means, first of all, we have to make absolutely certain that we don't do anything nasty to the universes below ours, since the same thing will happen to us. And secondly, we can do very nice things for the guys in the computer, thereby helping ourselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You've thought about this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's all in my woefully overlooked article on the subject, Tim, you should read more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Guh. This has been an extremely bad day for my ego, Diane. The only comfort I take from this is that somewhere up there, right at the top of a near-infinite tower of quantum supercomputers, there is a version of you who was completely wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;She's in the minority.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim checked the clock and picked his bag up again. &quot;I have to go or I'm going to miss the next bus as well at this rate. This will still be here after the weekend, I suppose?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, we can't exactly turn it off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Tim, halfway to the door, then stopped mid-stride and stood still, realising. &quot;Oh.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That... could be a problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, an iceberg wouldn’t float &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like this. Its three-dimensional distribution of mass and its relative density compared to the water are both significant factors that are only approximated here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading has been a huge part of my life. The written word has had arguably more of an impact on my life than anything I have experienced in person. As a kid back in early 2000’s; this meant a lot of library trips and saving for paperbacks. I also caught the first wave of the e-ink revolution. Nothing beats a real book, in terms of textures and scents; but e-ink devices and the fantastic tools outlined here should make reading digital books much more palpable &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo%5FAura%5FHD&quot;&gt;Kobo Aura HD&lt;/a&gt; for almost a decade now, ever since its release. This means my setup is about as stable as its going to get in the near future. As good a time as any to collect my thoughts &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;. The focus is on e-ink devices and auxiliary tools; not on all digital content; so there are no mentions of syncing or reading on the go (with a phone) or of monitors which are good for reading on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-content&quot;&gt;The Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general; my e-ink reading habits can be broadly broken into the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Light Reading&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Practically this includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33462912-rohit-goswami&quot;&gt;anything I review on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;; these are not often re-read; nor read very deeply; since they are read for pleasure. They are however, rarely deleted&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Required Reading&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Anything which typically requires me to take notes or practice / write out proofs; these are most often considered to be either coursework (for someone somewhere) or research monographs. These are typically large (in size) and unwieldy (in that they often lack TOCs) and are read multiple times; with a focus on highlights and notes&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Active Research&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;These are the most ephemeral of my reading habits; and also the most numerous; I do not typically store these on my e-reader; and rarely need to make notes on the reader &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;. These are often tiny; but require special work due to the metadata involved&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Content Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Software Stack&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Deletion Rate&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Light Reading&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Calibre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rare&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Required Reading&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Calibre&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Never&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Active Research&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Calibre + Zotero&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Frequent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I am a huge proponent of RSS feeds (with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news%5Fflash%5Fgtk&quot;&gt;Newsflash&lt;/a&gt;) and read online content voraciously with both a &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.getpocket.com/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diigo.com/user/rgoswami&quot;&gt;Diigo&lt;/a&gt; subscription&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt;; I sincerely do not believe blog stuff or anything tailored for the web should have a presence on an e-ink device; so there shall be no mention of those parts of my reading habits&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary e-reader is still my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kobo.com/koboaurahd?%5F%5F%5Fstore=au&amp;amp;style=onestore&quot;&gt;Kobo Aura HD&lt;/a&gt; (complete with a snazzy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cover-Up-eReader-Natural-Cover-Function/dp/B00DZJ5VM0&quot;&gt;hemp sleep-cover&lt;/a&gt;), and has been my go to for almost a decade now since its release. Recently I have augmented my workflow with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2&quot;&gt;reMarkable 2&lt;/a&gt;; though I have yet to break it in very well; mostly because I tend to gravitate towards typing out my thoughts &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt; instead of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kobo Aura HD is still the pinnacle of reading technology to me; mostly because the firmware is easy to bypass; and there is a vibrant community of developers on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=210800&quot;&gt;MobileRead Forums&lt;/a&gt;. Display and spec aside; the biggest reason for never replacing it has been been the simple fact that most modern e-readers no longer support SD cards; and much of my workflow depends on storing insane amounts of material offline &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d393a91160884052b7717a31a565283336a03ccf/eb437/ox-hugo/2021-02-20_01-39-20_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1: Primary reading device with Koreader&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: Primary reading device with Koreader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I never use Nickel (the default Kobo interface), and it would probably choke trying to scan my 200 GB of content; so I haven’t updated the firmware in forever. My interactions are almost always in &lt;a href=&quot;https://koreader.rocks&quot;&gt;Koreader&lt;/a&gt;; and my launching poison of choice is the now no longer developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=293804&quot;&gt;Kobo start menu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;software&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking; the main parts of the software pipeline from digital book to brain are simply the syncing mechanism and the UI/UX/OS of the device in question; though it is often best to consider pre-processing books for devices too. These are covered in the order used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;k2pdfopt&quot;&gt;k2pdfopt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of reflowing text for an optimal reading experience, especially given the slightly limited processing power of my primary reading device is an enticing prospect. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/&quot;&gt;K2pdfopt or the Kindle 2 PDF Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; is as criminally underrated as it is fantastic. An approach which works well for my device involves setting up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HaoZeke/Dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles/common/.local/bin/fileHelpers/docK2pdf&quot;&gt;a simple shell script&lt;/a&gt; (part &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HaoZeke/Dotfiles&quot;&gt;of my Dotfiles&lt;/a&gt;) for optimizing files on the fly before sending them through &lt;code&gt;calibre&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Using default settings&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;tput setaf 4&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;tput setaf 2&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; You might want to get pypdfocr&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; is OCR'ed.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A directory with perfectly &lt;code&gt;pdf&lt;/code&gt; files re-flowed text
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possibly OCR’ed for string searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOC editing is still rather janky; but this is also because the OCR process is still rather spotty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;calibre&quot;&gt;Calibre&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://calibre-ebook.com/&quot;&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent library software, and there are very few alternatives which offer all the salient features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Syncing&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Apart from working well with a plethora of official devices, Koreader is also pretty well supported, and mounting folders allows for easy management of a secret library (e.g. &lt;code&gt;.Library&lt;/code&gt;) on an SD card to prevent Nickel from reading and choking on large libraries&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Multiple Libraries&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I personally keep one for fiction, one for non-fiction, and one (transiently populated) one for papers&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Good metadata collection&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Nothing beats rich metadata, and with third party plugins, all the best content providers can be leveraged for blurbs; plus most purchased books come with metadata which &lt;code&gt;calibre&lt;/code&gt; can read&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t perfect, there are far better &lt;a href=&quot;https://opds.io/&quot;&gt;OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System)&lt;/a&gt; servers like the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seblucas/cops&quot;&gt;COPS (Calibre OPDS)&lt;/a&gt; project, and there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://anarc.at/software/desktop/calibre/&quot;&gt;some security concerns in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but it is really usable and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre&quot;&gt;under active development&lt;/a&gt;; plus it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kovidgoyal.net/&quot;&gt;fun developer&lt;/a&gt;. I also personally find the file conversion lacking, compared to &lt;code&gt;k2pdfopt&lt;/code&gt;, but as a library management system it is really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zotero-sync&quot;&gt;Zotero Sync&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calibre provides a handy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3339191#poststop&quot;&gt;ZMI (Zotero Metadata Importer) plugin&lt;/a&gt; which allows for exported papers to be imported into &lt;code&gt;calibre&lt;/code&gt; and from then into the e-reader as expected. Combined with the folder mounts facilitated by &lt;code&gt;calibre&lt;/code&gt; this allows for a painless way to ensure a quick export; optimize; sync; read and delete workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;koreader&quot;&gt;Koreader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koreader is probably the best thing to happen to e-ink devices since sliced bread. It replaces the need to use any cables with an e-reader; since newer versions have a nice SSH server, and can also update itself. Since this is mostly used as is; and all the information required is on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki&quot;&gt;Github Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, there’s not much else to say here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is probably worth noting that the in-built re-flow options do tend to cause major artifacts on older hardware, and is best avoided. Almost equivalently, and at a far lower cost in terms of performance, page contents can be fit to width and zoomed in automatically, which is almost as good as working with &lt;code&gt;k2pdfopt&lt;/code&gt; in some special cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my unfortunate separation from my library back home; it is likely that my e-ink devices will continue to be my primary source of reading material. Plus the long retarded color e-ink market finally seems to be moving out of its stupor &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;/&gt;. The only possible addendum to this methodology would probably involve integrating &lt;code&gt;orgmode&lt;/code&gt; and the reMarkable 2 sometime. E-ink is here to stay. This setup would probably need revisions involving &lt;code&gt;rclone&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;syncthing&lt;/code&gt; if I ever gave up and opted for a “modern” device without an SD slot.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>My Life in E-ink</og:title>
<og:description>Collection of odds and ends relating to e-readers including personal reminisces Background Reading has been a huge part of my life. The written word has had arguably more of an impact on my life than anything I have experienced in person. As a kid back in early 2000’s; this meant a lot of library trips and saving for paperbacks. I also caught the first wave of the e-ink revolution.</og:description>
