<title>GitHub Should Start an App Store</title>
<link>https://www.ankshilp.com/time_for_github_app_store/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ankshilp.com/time_for_github_app_store/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Google suspended Elements - matrix chat app - from play store &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25965443&quot;&gt;without any reasonable explanation&lt;/a&gt;. I think this was an automated removal triggered by user reports or some other factors. The matrix team tried to reach out to them for explanation to no avail. We have seen this pattern in many cases now. Either it’s getting overwhelming for Google to monitor apps in its store or they don’t want apps like Elements which is decentralized to be on their store. The later mostly seems like a conspiracy theory and I think former is more true. In any case, it doesn’t make any sense for a single entity to govern what gets installed and not on billions of devices. A decentralized app store whould be best to fight this sort of suspensions but it’s far from reality at the moment. The alternative? GitHub App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-why-github&quot;&gt;But Why GitHub?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few reasons why I think GitHub is our best bet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/&quot;&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/a&gt; debacle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They could finally give the desktop the app store it deserves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will have to create app store applications for major platforms along with provision to host closed source applications on their store and they should be good to go. Honestly I can not imagine any other player being more successful in app stores than GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355663753380032512&quot;&gt;Google has reinstated Elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Robinhood disabled buys but not sells</title>
<link>https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There's been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood's actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that's mainly because it's a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, what happened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that fateful day, Gamestop stock had massive volatility, and given the cries of &quot;Buy!&quot; and &quot;Hold!&quot; from /r/WSBs, I'd assume on Robinhood, a broker targeted at retail investors, it'd be heavily imbalanced towards buy trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As volatility increased, the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp;amp; Clearing Corporation) increased the deposit requirements for brokers. Basically, when you submit a trade on a broker, the exchange of money for stock doesn't actually happen until 2 days later, and the firm that handles that exchange is called a clearing firm. Before then, Robinhood just sends records: John bought 2 GME for $600, Mary sold 1 GME for $290. If that's all that happened that day, then Robinhood would need to provide $310 dollars to the clearing firm, and receive 1 stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a credit risk - what if Robinhood doesn't have the money on settlement? The clearing firm would be on the hook. So the DTCC requires that brokers put up a deposit beforehand. On that day, the DTCC massively increased the deposit requirements for brokers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the DTCC wouldn’t specify how much it required from specific firms but said that by the end of the day industrywide collateral requirements jumped to $33.5 billion, up from $26 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop&quot;&gt;Levine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week&quot;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. And they quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/robinhood-gamestop-reddit/index.html&quot;&gt;scrounged up some capital&lt;/a&gt; so they could continue on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Robinhood's Clearing Firm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood actually has their own clearing firm, Robinhood Securities... for some reason, but it's still a DTCC member and must listen to what the SEC regulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;update 12:32 - On margin?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to be mistaking the situation. It is not about margin accounts - while yes, Robinhood &quot;instant transfers&quot; provides the illusion of being instant effectively with margin, it's not really the issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers cannot use client money to satisfy their clearing fund obligation. So whether or not the accounts had a settled balance didn't matter - as you can see from the other brokers which halted buys and did not have &quot;instant transfers&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is about what's effectively &lt;em&gt;collateral&lt;/em&gt; the brokers must put up so that all parties can mitigate the risk of a broker failing. Of course client money is used when the transaction &lt;em&gt;settles&lt;/em&gt;, but, naturally, you can't use their money, which isn't yours, as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But why ONLY Buys?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposit requirement is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the variable to look at is the 99% 2d VaR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volatility component is designed to capture the market price risk associated with each Member’s portfolio at a 99th percentile level of confidence. The VaR Charge is the volatility component applicable to most Net Unsettled Positions, and usually comprises the largest portion of a Member’s Required Deposit. Procedure XV of the Rules currently provides that the VaR Charge shall be calculated in accordance with a generally accepted portfolio volatility margin model utilizing assumptions based on reasonable historical data and an appropriate volatility range. As such, NSCC currently calculates a Member’s VaR Charge utilizing the VaR model, which incorporates an EWMA volatility estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf&quot;&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when I subtracted John's buys of $600 with Mary's sell of $290 to get $310? That's the broker's net unsettled cash positions. The 99% VaR is basically, &quot;99% of the time the broker's net unsettled will not be higher than X&quot;. You might remember if you took statistics about confidence intervals; this is the upper 99% confidence interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bad Desmos Graphs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's model our risk as a Normal curve, for simplicity's sake. Here I've graphed a normal distribution with a line representing the 95% percentile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Y axis is probability, the X axis is Robinhood's net unsettled positions. The more positive, the more money they'd owe theoretically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what happens if more people buy than sell? Then it'd shift over to the right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r2&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasn't the 95% percentile moved rightward as well? Now, what happens if the market is super volatile (i.e, the std dev of the distribution increases)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r3&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, now it's even more to the right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, &lt;strong&gt;buys make this worse&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sells make it better&lt;/strong&gt;. Robinhood &lt;em&gt;could not&lt;/em&gt; execute buys, because it would increase the deposits they'd need, which they legally must obligate by. Sells, on the other hand, do not have this problem. They would not push the 95% boundary more to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Decision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, it's not a bad decision or good decision that Robinhood halted buys of GME - it wasn't a decision, and it wasn't something they alone did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These brokers halted buys of GME&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robinhood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webull&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M1 Finance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-Trade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While others only halted options&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interactive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schwab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tradeing212&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm, see a pattern? The former group includes companies like Robinhood (2013), WeBull (2017), M1 Finance (2015), while the latter has TDA (1975), Schwab(1971), Trading212 (2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Okay, E-Trade is actually old too, but I guess they're just cash-strapped right now?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like young brokers with a limited capital resources to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay or Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's something to fault Robinhood, it's that they're a young, janky broker (and also you might be getting screwed on the spread by Citadel). If they had more money on-hand they might not have had to stop buys of Gamestop. Perhaps they should have expected this and raised more capital earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's a real reason to stay away from Robinhood. But for the love of god do not swap to WeBull or something if that's your concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't do it because you're abhorred by Robinhood's class warfare or something. Because that didn't happen - it was a mixture of SEC regulations and a cash-strapped startup (well, cash-strapped on big broker scales).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although if you want to get mad at Hedge Funds anyway, feel free! You should always be mad at Hedge Funds. But please pick a real reason - you have no lack of choice to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT&quot;&gt;The MIT License&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular open-source software license. Here’s one read of it, line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;read-the-license&quot;&gt;Read the License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re involved in open-source software and haven’t taken the time to read the license from top to bottom—it’s only 171 words—you need to do so now. Especially if licenses aren’t your day-to-day. Make a mental note of anything that seems off or unclear, and keep trucking. I’ll repeat every word again, in chunks and in order, with context and commentary. But it’s important to have the whole in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIT License (MIT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright (c) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;copyright holders&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the Software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The license is arranged in five paragraphs, but breaks down logically like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Header&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;License Title&lt;/strong&gt;: “The MIT License”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright Notice&lt;/strong&gt;: “Copyright (c) …”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;License Grant&lt;/strong&gt;: “Permission is hereby granted …”
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant Scope&lt;/strong&gt;: “… to deal in the Software …”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;: “… subject to …”
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attribution and Notice&lt;/strong&gt;: “The above … shall be included …”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warranty Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;The software is provided ‘as is’ …&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitation of Liability&lt;/strong&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;In no event …&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;license-title&quot;&gt;License Title&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIT License (MIT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The MIT License” is a not a single license, but a family of license forms derived from language prepared for releases from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has seen a lot of changes over the years, both for the original projects that used it, and also as a model for other projects. The Fedora Project maintains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:MIT?rd=Licensing/MIT&quot;&gt;kind of cabinet of MIT license curiosities&lt;/a&gt;, with insipid variations preserved in plain text like anatomical specimens in formaldehyde, tracing a wayward kind of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spdx.org&quot;&gt;Software Package Data eXchange&lt;/a&gt; groups have standardized a generic MIT-style license form as “The MIT License”. OSI in turn has adopted SPDX’ standardized &lt;a href=&quot;http://spdx.org/licenses/&quot;&gt;string identifiers&lt;/a&gt; for common open-source licenses, with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/code&gt; pointing unambiguously to the standardized form “MIT License”. If you want MIT-style terms for a new project, use &lt;a href=&quot;http://spdx.org/licenses/MIT&quot;&gt;the standardized form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you include “The MIT License” or “SPDX:MIT” in a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; file, any responsible reviewer will still run a comparison of the text against the standard form, just to be sure. While various license forms calling themselves “MIT License” vary only in minor details, the looseness of what counts as an “MIT License” has tempted some authors into adding bothersome “customizations”. The canonical horrible, no good, very bad example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://spdx.org/licenses/JSON&quot;&gt;the JSON license&lt;/a&gt;, an MIT-family license plus “The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.”. This kind of thing might be “very Crockford”. It is definitely a pain in the ass. Maybe the joke was supposed to be on the lawyers. But they laughed all the way to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story: “MIT License” alone is ambiguous. Folks probably have a good idea what you mean by it, but you’re only going to save everyone—yourself included—time by copying the text of the standard MIT License form into your project. If you use metadata, like the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;license&lt;/code&gt; property in package manager metadata files, to designate the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MIT&lt;/code&gt; license, make sure your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; file and any header comments use the standard form text. All of this can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/licensor&quot;&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;copyright-notice&quot;&gt;Copyright Notice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright (c) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;copyright holders&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the 1976 Copyright Act, United States copyright law required specific actions, called “formalities”, to secure copyright in creative works. If you didn’t follow those formalities, your rights to sue others for unauthorized use of your work were limited, often completely lost. One of those formalities was “notice”: Putting marks on your work and otherwise making it known to the market that you were claiming copyright. The © is a standard symbol for marking copyrighted works, to give notice of copyright. The ASCII character set doesn’t have the © symbol, but &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Copyright (c)&lt;/code&gt; gets the same point across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1976 Copyright Act, which “implemented” many requirements of the international Berne Convention, eliminated formalities for securing copyright. At least in the United States, copyright holders still need to register their copyrighted works before suing for infringement, with potentially higher damages if they register before infringement begins. In practice, however, many register copyright right before bringing suit against someone in particular. You don’t lose your copyright just by failing to put notices on it, registering, sending a copy to the Library of Congress, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if copyright notices aren’t as absolutely necessary as they used to be, they are still plenty useful. Stating the year a work was authored and who the copyright belonged to give some sense of when copyright in the work might expire, bringing the work into the public domain. The identity of the author or authors is also useful: United States law calculates copyright terms differently for individual and “corporate” authors. Especially in business use, it may also behoove a company to think twice about using software from a known competitor, even if the license terms give very generous permission. If you’re hoping others will see your work and want to license it from you, copyright notices serve nicely for attribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for “copyright holder”: Not all standard form licenses have a space to write this out. More recent license forms, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&quot;&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GPL 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, publish &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; texts that are meant to be copied verbatim, with header comments and separate files elsewhere to indicate who owns copyright and is giving the license. Those approaches neatly discourage changes to the “standard” texts, accidental or intentional. They also make automated license identification more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIT License descends from language written for releases of code by institutions. For institutional releases, there was just one clear “copyright holder”, the institution releasing the code. Other institutions cribbed these licenses, replacing “MIT” with their own names, leading eventually to the generic forms we have now. This process repeated for other short-form institutional licenses of the era, notably the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-4-Clause&quot;&gt;original four-clause BSD License&lt;/a&gt; for the University of California, Berkeley, now used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause&quot;&gt;three-clause&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause&quot;&gt;two-clause&lt;/a&gt; variants, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isc.org/downloads/software-support-policy/isc-license/&quot;&gt;The ISC License&lt;/a&gt; for the Internet Systems Consortium, an MIT variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case, the institution listed itself as the copyright holder in reliance on rules of copyright ownership, called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://worksmadeforhire.com/&quot;&gt;works made for hire&lt;/a&gt;” rules, that give employers and clients ownership of copyright in some work their employees and contractors do on their behalf. These rules don’t usually apply to distributed collaborators submitting code voluntarily. This poses a problem for project-steward foundations, like the Apache Foundation and Eclipse Foundation, that accept contributions from a more diverse group of contributors. The usual foundation approach thus far has been to use a house license that states a single copyright holder—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&quot;&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html&quot;&gt;EPL 1.0&lt;/a&gt;—backed up by contributor license agreements—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas&quot;&gt;Apache CLAs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA&quot;&gt;Eclipse CLAs&lt;/a&gt;—to collect rights from contributors. Collecting copyright ownership in one place is even more important under “copyleft” licenses like the GPL, which rely on copyright owners to enforce license conditions to promote software-freedom values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, loads of projects without any kind of institutional or business steward use MIT-style license terms. SPDX and OSI have helped these use cases by standardizing forms of licenses like MIT and ISC that don’t refer to a specific entity or institutional copyright holder. Armed with those forms, the prevailing practice of project authors is to fill their own name in the copyright notice of the form very early on … and maybe bump the year here and there. At least under United States copyright law, the resulting copyright notice doesn’t give a full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original owner of a piece of software retains ownership of their work. But while MIT-style license terms give others rights to build on and change the software, creating what the law calls “derivative works”, they don’t give the original author ownership of copyright in others’ contributions. Rather, each contributor has copyright in any &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co.&quot;&gt;even marginally creative&lt;/a&gt; work they make using the existing code as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these projects also balk at the idea of taking contributor license agreements, to say nothing of signed copyright assignments. That’s both naive and understandable. Despite the assumption of some newer open-source developers that sending a pull request on GitHub “automatically” licenses the contribution for distribution on the terms of the project’s existing license, United States law doesn’t recognize any such rule. Strong copyright &lt;em&gt;protection&lt;/em&gt;, not permissive licensing, is the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: GitHub later changed its site-wide terms of service to include an attempt to flip this default, at least on GitHub.com. I’ve written up some thoughts on that development, not all of them positive, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/02/16/Against-Legislating-the-Nonobvious.html&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fill the gap between legally effective, well-documented grants of rights in contributions and no paper trail at all, some projects have adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developercertificate.org/&quot;&gt;Developer Certificate of Origin&lt;/a&gt;, a standard statement contributors allude to using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Signed-Off-By&lt;/code&gt; metadata tags in their Git commits. The Developer Certificate of Origin was developed for Linux kernel development in the wake of the infamous SCO lawsuits, which alleged that chunks of Linux’ code derived from SCO-owned Unix source. As a means of creating a paper trail showing that each line of Linux came from a contributor, the Developer Certificate of Origin functions nicely. While the Developer Certificate of Origin isn’t a license, it does provide lots of good evidence that those submitting code expected the project to distribute their code, and for others to use it under the kernel’s existing license terms. The kernel also maintains a machine-readable &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CREDITS&lt;/code&gt; file listing contributors with name, affiliation, contribution area, and other metadata. I’ve done &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/berneout/berneout-pledge&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/berneout/authors-certificate&quot;&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; adapting that approach for projects that don’t use the kernel’s development flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;license-grant&quot;&gt;License Grant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meat of The MIT License is, you guessed it, a license. In general terms, a license is permission that one person or legal entity—the “licensor”—gives another—the “licensee”—to do something the law would otherwise let them sue for. The MIT License is a promise not to sue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law sometimes distinguishes licenses from promises to give licenses. If someone breaks a promise to give a license, you may be able to sue them for breaking their promise, but you may not end up with a license. “Hereby” is one of those hokey, archaic-sounding words lawyers just can’t get rid of. It’s used here to show that the license text itself gives the license, and not just a promise of a license. It’s a legal &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression&quot;&gt;IIFE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many licenses give permission to a specific, named licensee, The MIT License is a “public license”. Public licenses give everybody—the public at large—permission. This is one of the three great ideas in open-source licensing. The MIT License captures this idea by giving a license “to any person obtaining a copy of … the Software”. As we’ll see later, there is also a condition to receiving this license that ensures others will learn about their permission, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parenthetical with a capitalized term in quotation marks (a “Definition”), is the standard way to give terms specific meanings in American-style legal documents. Courts will reliably look back to the terms of the definition when they see a defined, capitalized term used elsewhere in the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;grant-scope&quot;&gt;Grant Scope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to deal in the Software without restriction,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the licensee’s point of view, these are the seven most important words in The MIT License. The key legal concerns are getting sued for copyright infringement and getting sued for patent infringement. Neither copyright law nor patent law uses “to deal in” as a term of art; it has no specific meaning in court. As a result, any court deciding a dispute between a licensor and a licensee would ask what the parties meant and understood by this language. What the court will see is that the language is intentionally broad and open-ended. It gives licensees a strong argument against any claim by a licensor that they didn’t give permission for the licensee to do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; specific thing with the software, even if the thought clearly didn’t occur to either side when the license was given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No piece of legal writing is perfect, “fully settled in meaning”, or unmistakably clear. Beware anyone who pretends otherwise. This is the least perfect part of The MIT License. There are three main issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, “including without limitation” is a legal antipattern. It crops up in any number of flavors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“including, without limitation”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“including, but not limited to”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many, many pointless variations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these share a common purpose, and they all fail to achieve it reliably. Fundamentally, drafters who use them try to have their cake and eat it, too. In The MIT License, that means introducing specific examples of “dealing in the Software”—“use, copy, modify” and so on—without implying that licensee action has to be something like the examples given to count as “dealing in”. The trouble is that, if you end up needing a court to review and interpret the terms of a license, the court will see its job as finding out what those fighting meant by the language. If the court needs to decide what “deal in” means, it cannot “unsee” the examples, even if you tell it to. I’d argue that “deal in the Software without restriction” alone would be better for licensees. Also shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the verbs given as examples of “deal in” are a hodgepodge. Some have specific meanings under copyright or patent law, others almost do or just plain don’t:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;21.985851110144&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1.4266666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; appears in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2017-title35/USCODE-2017-title35-partIII-chap28-sec271&quot;&gt;United States Code title 35, section 271(a)&lt;/a&gt;, the patent law’s list of what patent owners can sue others for doing without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.4805194805195&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;copy&lt;/em&gt; appears in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2017-title17/USCODE-2017-title17-chap1-sec106&quot;&gt;United States Code title 17, section 106&lt;/a&gt;, the copyright law’s list of what copyright owners can sue others for doing without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;modify&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t appear in either copyright or patent statute. It is probably closest to “prepare derivative works” under the copyright statute, but may also implicate improving or otherwise derivative inventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;merge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t appear in either copyright or patent statute. “Merger” has a specific meaning in copyright, but that’s clearly not what’s intended here. Rather, a court would probably read “merge” according to its meaning in industry, as in “to merge code”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.6917098445596&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;publish&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t appear in either copyright or patent statute. Since “the Software” is what’s being published, it probably hews closest to “distribute” under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2017-title17/USCODE-2017-title17-chap1-sec106&quot;&gt;copyright statute&lt;/a&gt;. That statute also covers rights to perform and display works “publicly”, but those rights apply only to specific kinds of copyrighted work, like plays, sound recordings, and motion pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.61363636363636&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;distribute&lt;/em&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2017-title17/USCODE-2017-title17-chap1-sec106&quot;&gt;copyright statute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sublicense&lt;/em&gt; is a general term of intellectual property law. The right to sublicense means the right to give others licenses of their own, to do some or all of what you have permission to do. The MIT License’s right to sublicense is actually somewhat unusual in open-source licenses generally. The norm is what Heather Meeker calls a “direct licensing” approach, where everyone who gets a copy of the software and its license terms gets a license direct from the owner. Anyone who might get a sublicense under the MIT License will probably end up with a copy of the license telling them they have a direct license, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.4083969465649&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sell copies of&lt;/em&gt; is a mongrel. It is close to “offer to sell” and “sell” in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2017-title35/USCODE-2017-title35-partIII-chap28-sec271&quot;&gt;patent statute&lt;/a&gt;, but refers to “copies”, a copyright concept. On the copyright side, it seems close to “distribute”, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2017-title17/USCODE-2017-title17-chap1-sec106&quot;&gt;copyright statute&lt;/a&gt; makes no mention of sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so&lt;/em&gt; seems redundant of “sublicense”. It’s also unnecessary to the extent folks who get copies also get a direct license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, as a result of this mishmash of legal, industry, general-intellectual-property, and general-use terms, it isn’t clear whether The MIT License includes a patent license. The general language “deal in” and some of the example verbs, especially “use”, point toward a patent license, albeit a very unclear one. The fact that the license comes from the &lt;em&gt;copyright holder&lt;/em&gt;, who may or may not have patent rights in inventions in the software, as well as most of the example verbs and the definition of “the Software” itself, all point strongly toward a copyright license. More recent permissive open-source licenses, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&quot;&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, address copyright, patent, and even trademark separately and specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-license-conditions&quot;&gt;Three License Conditions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;subject to the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s always a catch! MIT has three!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t follow The MIT License’s conditions, you don’t get the permission the license offers. So failing to do what the conditions say at least theoretically leaves you open to a lawsuit, probably a copyright lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the value of the software to the licensee to motivate compliance with conditions, even though the licensee paid nothing for the license, is the second great idea of open-source licensing. The last, not found in The MIT License, builds off license conditions: “Copyleft” licenses like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt; use license conditions to control how those making changes can license and distribute their changed versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;notice-condition&quot;&gt;Notice Condition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you give someone a copy of the software, you need to include the license text and any copyright notice. This serves a few critical purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gives others notice that they have permission for the software under the public license. This is a key part of the direct-licensing model, where each user gets a license direct from the copyright holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes known who’s behind the software, so they can be showered in praises, glory, and cold, hard cash donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensures the warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability (coming up next) follow the software around. Everyone who gets a copy should get a copy of those licensor protections, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing to stop you charging for providing a copy, or even a copy in compiled form, without source code. But when you do, you can’t pretend that the MIT code is your own proprietary code, or provided under some other license. Those receiving get to know their rights under the “public license”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, compliance with this condition is breaking down. Nearly every open-source license has such an “attribution” condition. Makers of system and installed software often understand they’ll need to compile a notices file or “license information” screen, with copies of license texts for libraries and components, for each release of their own. The project-steward foundations have been instrumental in teaching those practices. But web developers, as a whole, haven’t got the memo. It can’t be explained away by a lack of tooling—there is plenty—or the highly modular nature of packages from npm and other repositories—which uniformly standardize metadata formats for license information. All the good JavaScript minifiers have command-line flags for preserving license header comments. Other tools will concatenate &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; files from package trees. There’s really no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;warranty-disclaimer&quot;&gt;Warranty Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every state in the United States has enacted a version of the Uniform Commercial Code, a model statute of laws governing commercial transactions. Article 2 of the UCC—“Division 2” in California—governs contracts for sales of goods, from used automobiles bought off the lot to large shipments of industrial chemicals to manufacturing plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the UCC’s rules about sales contracts are mandatory. These rules always apply, whether those buying and selling like them or not. Others are just “defaults”. Unless buyers and sellers opt out in writing, the UCC implies that they want the baseline rule found in the UCC’s text for their deal. Among the default rules are implied “warranties”, or promises by sellers to buyers about the quality and usability of the goods being sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big theoretical debate about whether public licenses like The MIT License are contracts—enforceable agreements between licensors and licensees—or just licenses, which go one way, but may come with strings attached, their conditions. There is less debate about whether software counts as “goods”, triggering the UCC’s rules. There is no debate among licensors on liability: They don’t want to get sued for lots of money if the software they give away for free breaks, causes problems, doesn’t work, or otherwise causes trouble. That’s exactly the opposite of what three default rules for “implied warranties” do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;6.3003613369467&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.8032407407407&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implied warranty of “merchantability” under &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2314.&amp;amp;lawCode=COM&quot;&gt;UCC section 2-314&lt;/a&gt; is a promise that “the goods”—the Software—are of at least average quality, properly packaged and labeled, and fit for the ordinary purposes they are intended to serve. This warranty applies only if the one giving the software is a “merchant” with respect to the software, meaning they deal in software and hold themselves out as skilled in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.93117408906883&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implied warranty of “fitness for a particular purpose” under &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2315.&amp;amp;lawCode=COM&quot;&gt;UCC section 2-315&lt;/a&gt; kicks in when the seller knows the buyer is relying on them to provide goods for a particular purpose. The goods need to actually be “fit” for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implied warranty of “noninfringement” is not part of the UCC, but is a common feature of general contract law. This implied promise protects the buyer if it turns out the goods they received infringe somebody else’s intellectual property rights. That would be the case if the software under The MIT License didn’t actually belong to the one trying to license it, or if it fell under a patent owned by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=2316.&amp;amp;lawCode=COM&quot;&gt;Section 2-316(3)&lt;/a&gt; of the UCC requires language opting out of, or “excluding”, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose to be conspicuous. “Conspicuous” in turn means written or formatted to call attention to itself, the opposite of microscopic fine print meant to slip past unwary consumers. State law may impose a similar attention-grabbing requirement for disclaimers of noninfringement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers have long suffered under the delusion that writing anything in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ALL-CAPS&lt;/code&gt; meets the conspicuous requirement. That isn’t true. Courts have criticized the Bar for pretending as much, and most everyone agrees all-caps does more to discourage reading than compel it. All the same, most open-source-license forms set their warranty disclaimers in all-caps, in part because that’s the only obvious way to make it stand out in plain-text &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; files. I’d prefer to use asterisks or other ASCII art, but that ship sailed long, long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitation-of-liability&quot;&gt;Limitation of Liability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIT License gives permission for software “free of charge”, but the law does not assume that folks receiving licenses free of charge give up their rights to sue when things go wrong and the licensor is to blame. “Limitations of liability”, often paired with “damages exclusions”, work a lot like licenses, as promises not to sue. But these are protections for the &lt;em&gt;licensor&lt;/em&gt; against lawsuits by &lt;em&gt;licensees&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, courts read limitations of liability and damages exclusions warily, since they can shift an incredible amount of risk from one side to another. To protect the community’s vital interest in giving folks a way to redress wrongs done in court, they “strictly construe” language limiting liability, reading it against the one protected by it where possible. Limitations of liability have to be specific to stand up. Especially in “consumer” contracts and other situations where those giving up the right to sue lack sophistication or bargaining power, courts have sometimes refused to honor language that seemed buried out of sight. Partly for that reason, partly by sheer force of habit, lawyers tend to give limits of liability the all-caps treatment, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling down a bit, the “limitation of liability” part is a cap on the amount of money a licensee can sue for. In open-source licenses, that limit is always no money at all, $0, “not liable”. By contrast, in commercial licenses, it’s often a multiple of license fees paid in the last 12-month period, though it’s often negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “exclusion” part lists, specifically, kinds of legal claims—reasons to sue for damages—the licensor cannot use. Like many, many legal forms, The MIT License mentions actions “of contract”—for breaching a contract—and “of tort”. Tort rules are general rules against carelessly or maliciously harming others. If you run someone down on the road while texting, you have committed a tort. If your company sells faulty headphones that burn peoples’ ears off, your company has committed a tort. If a contract doesn’t specifically exclude tort claims, courts sometimes read exclusion language in a contract to prevent only contract claims. For good measure, The MIT License throws in “or otherwise”, just to catch the odd admiralty law or other, exotic kind of legal claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “arising from, out of or in connection with” is a recurring tick symptomatic of the legal draftsman’s inherent, anxious insecurity. The point is that any lawsuit having anything to do with the software is covered by the limitation and exclusions. On the off chance something can “arise from”, but not “out of”, or “in connection with”, it feels better to have all three in the form, so pack ‘em in. Never mind that any court forced to split hairs in this part of the form will have to come up with different meanings for each, on the assumption that a professional drafter wouldn’t use different words in a row to mean the same thing. Never mind that in practice, where courts don’t feel good about a limitation that’s disfavored to begin with, they’ll be more than ready to read the scope trigger narrowly. But I digress. The same language appears in literally millions of contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;overall&quot;&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these quibbles are a bit like spitting out gum on the way into church. The MIT License is a legal classic. The MIT License works. It is by no means a panacea for all software IP ills, in particular the software patent scourge, which it predates by decades. But MIT-style licenses have served admirably, fulfilling a narrow purpose—reversing troublesome default rules of copyright, sales, and contract law—with a minimal combination of discreet legal tools. In the greater context of computing, its longevity is astounding. The MIT License has outlasted and will outlast the vast majority of software licensed under it. We can only guess how many decades of faithful legal service it will have given when it finally loses favor. It’s been especially generous to those who couldn’t have afforded their own lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen how the The MIT License we know today is a specific, standardized set of terms, bringing order at long last to a chaos of institution-specific, haphazard variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen how its approach to attribution and copyright notice informed intellectual property management practices for academic, standards, commercial, and foundation institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen how The MIT Licenses grants permission for software to all, for free, subject to conditions that protect licensors from warranties and liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen that despite some crusty verbiage and lawyerly affectation, one hundred and seventy one little words can get a hell of a lot of legal work done, clearing a path for open-source software through a dense underbrush of intellectual property and contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m so grateful for all who’ve taken the time to read this rather long post, to let me know they found it useful, and to help improve it. As always, I welcome your comments via &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com&quot;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kemitchell&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kemitchell/writing.kemitchell.com/tree/master/_posts/2016-09-21-MIT-License-Line-by-Line.md&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of folks have asked where they can read more, or find run-downs of other licenses, like the GNU General Public License or the Apache 2.0 license. No matter what your particular continuing interest may be, I heartily recommend the following books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start with this one because, while it’s somewhat dated, its approach is also closest to the line-by-line approach used above. O’Reilly has made it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/osfreesoft/book/&quot;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, by far the best writing on the GNU General Public License and copyleft more generally. This book covers the history, the licenses, their development, as well as compatibility and compliance. It’s the book I lend to clients considering or dealing with the GPL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great first book, also available for free &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rosenlaw.com/oslbook.htm&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best introduction to open-source licensing and related law for programmers starting from scratch. This one is also a bit dated in some specific details, but Larry’s taxonomy of licenses and succinct summary of open-source business models stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these were crucial to my own education as an open-source licensing lawyer. Their authors are professional heroes of mine. Have a read! — K.E.M&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;d303&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb dh hi&quot;&gt;As a long-time user (and active proponent) of Scheme/Common Lisp/Racket, I sometimes get asked why I &lt;span id=&quot;rmm&quot;/&gt;stick with them. Fortunately, I have always headed up my own engineering orgs, so I have never had to justify it to “management”, but there’s the even more important constituency of my own engineering colleagues who have never ever had the pleasure of using these languages. While they never ask for justification, they do ask out of intellectual curiosity, and sometimes out of wonder as to why I’m not going gaga over the next cool feature being dropped into Python or Scala, or whatever their flavor of the month is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dae8&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;While the actual flavor of Lisp used has varied for me (Scheme, Common Lisp, Racket, Lisp-for-Erlang), the core has always remained the same: An s-expression based, dynamically typed, mostly functional, call-by-value λ-calculus based language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3c01&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;I started serious programming in my teens in BASIC on a ZX Spectrum+, although I had previously dabbled in (hand-) writing Fortran programs. It was a defining period for me as it truly defined my career path. Very quickly I was pushing the language to its limits and trying to write programs that were well beyond the limited capacity of the language and its implementation. I moved on to Pascal for a short while (Turbo Pascal on a DOS box), which was fun for a while until I discovered C on Unix (Santa Cruz Operation Xenix!). That got me through a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, but it always left me wanting for more expressiveness in my programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ee6a&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;This was when I discovered Functional Programming (Thank you IISc!) in Miranda (Ugly Haskell’s very beautiful mom) and it opened my eyes to wanting &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;beauty&lt;/em&gt; in my programs. My notion of expressiveness in a programming language began to take very large leaps. My concept for what programs should look like now began encompassing brevity, elegance and readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8e6e&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Miranda wasn’t a particularly fast language, so execution speed was an issue. Miranda was also a statically typed language with Standard-ML style type inference. In the beginning, I was enamored with the type system. Over time, however, grew to despise it. While it helped me catch a few things at compile time, it mostly got in the way (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c401&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;A year or so after that, I ended up studying Programming Languages at Indiana University with Dan Friedman (of The Little Lisper / The Little Schemer fame). It was my introduction to Scheme (and the world of Lisp.) I finally knew that I had found the perfect medium to express my programs in. And it has not changed in those last 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3a0e&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;In this article I’m trying to explain, and perhaps explore, why it has been so. Am I just an old dinosaur who won’t change his ways? Or am I too haughty and contemptuous of new ideas? Or am I just jaded? The answer, I think, is none of the above. I found perfection and &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; has come along yet to unseat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;46b3&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Let’s break it down a little. I said this a few paragraphs back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;ji jj jk&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2f3f&quot; class=&quot;ii ij jh ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;An s-expression based, dynamically typed, mostly functional, call-by-value λ-calculus based language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f691&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;I’m going to start explaining this backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7018&quot; class=&quot;jl jm gm av jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki hi&quot;&gt;λ-calculus based language.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;660a&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il kj im in io kk ip iq ir kl is it iu km iv iw ix kn iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;The fundamental entity in all programs is a &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;. Functions have an intentionality to them that form the foundational basis of the software design process. You’re always thinking about how information is acted upon, how it is transformed, and how it is produced. I have yet to find a foundational framework that captures this inherent intentionality (the ‘how’) that is better than the λ-calculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f37b&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;The word &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;intentionality&lt;/em&gt; perhaps threw some of you guys off. Mathematics has two ways to think about functions. First, as a set of ordered pairs: (&lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;input, output&lt;/em&gt;). While this representation is a great way to prove theorems about functions, it is utterly useless when coding. This is also known as the &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;extensional&lt;/em&gt; view of functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b777&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;The second way to think about functions is as a transformation rule. For example, multiply the input by itself to get the output (which gives us the squaring function, conveniently abbreviated by every programming language as &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;sqr&lt;/em&gt;). This is the &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;intensional&lt;/em&gt; view of functions, which the λ-calculus captures nicely, and provides very simple rules to help us prove theorems about our functions, without resorting to extensionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;12a9&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;Now wait a minute&lt;/em&gt;, I’m sure you’re thinking. &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;I’ve never proved sh*t about my functions&lt;/em&gt;. I’m betting that you have. And that you do &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time. You’re always convincing yourself that your function is doing the right thing. Yours may not be a formal proof (which may be what leads to some bugs), but reasoning about code is something that software developers do all the time. They’re playing the code back in their head to see how it behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;891b&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Languages based on the λ-calculus make it &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; easy to “play back the code” in your head. The simple rules of the λ-calculus mean that there are fewer things to carry in your head and the code is easy to read and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;962f&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Programming languages are, of course, practical tools so the core simplicity has to be augmented in order to suit a broader purpose. This is why I love Scheme (and my current favorite flavor of it, Racket [CS, for those who care about such things]). What it adds to the core λ-calculus is the bare minimum to make it usable. Even the additions follow the basic principles espoused by the λ-calculus so there are few surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9ab4&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;This does mean, of course, that &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;recursion&lt;/em&gt; is a way of life. If you’re one of those people to whom recursion never made sense, or if you still believe “recursion is inefficient”, then it is high time to revisit it. Scheme (and Racket) effectively implement recursion as loops wherever possible. And not only that, the Scheme standard &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2c2a&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;This feature, called &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;tail call optimization&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;or TCO&lt;/em&gt;), has been around for a few decades and it is a sad commentary on the state of our programming languages that none of the modern languages support it. This is especially a problem with the JVM as newer languages have emerged trying to target the JVM as a runtime architecture. The JVM does not support it, and consequently the languages built on top of the JVM have to jump through hoops to provide some semblance of a sometimes applicable TCO. So, I always view any functional language targeting the JVM with great suspicion. It’s also the reason I have not become a fan of Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c89a&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;So that’s reason number one. Scheme/Racket is a very sensible implementation of a programming language based on the λ-calculus. As you might have noticed, I’m not using the word &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt; language to describe Scheme. That’s because while it is primarily functional, it does not skew all the way to non-mutability. As much as it discourages its use, Scheme recognizes that there are genuine contexts where there may be a use for mutations and it permits it without the artifice of auxiliary devices. I won’t argue here with the purists about why or why not this is a good idea, but it ties into something that I’ll talk about later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;9124&quot; class=&quot;jl jm gm av jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki hi&quot;&gt;Call-by-value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2ee1&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il kj im in io kk ip iq ir kl is it iu km iv iw ix kn iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Those of you who know the details of the λ-calculus may have recognized why I chose to make this distinction. Remember my history: I cut my functional teeth on Miranda which is a &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/em&gt; functional language (as is Haskell). This means that expressions are evaluated &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; when their values are needed. It is also how the original λ-calculus is defined. This means that arguments to a function are evaluated when they are used, not when the function is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;000f&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;This distinction is subtle, and it does have some yummy mathematical properties, but it has far reaching implications on “playing back the code” in your head. There are many instances where this hits you as a surprise (even for experienced programmers), but there’s one that you might perhaps relate to more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d27f&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;As a programmer, one of the most difficult bugs to deal with in your career would be the ones where printing something on the screen makes the bug go away. In a lazy functional language, printing something forces the evaluation of an expression where as in the buggy case it was perhaps not being evaluated. So, printing values as a debugging tool becomes suspect, since it critically changes how the program is behaving. I don’t know about you, but for me printing is a tool that someone will have to pry from my cold, dead fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4342&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;There are other subtleties too about lazy evaluation being used everywhere in the language that make it &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;much less appealing&lt;/em&gt; choice for me. I don’t ever want to guess when a certain expression is being evaluated. Either evaluate it or don’t. Don’t make me guess about when, especially if it is going to happen (or not) deep inside some library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7138&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Call-by-value has some implications in how to prove formal theorems about programs, but thankfully there exists a beast called the call-by-value λ-calculus that we can rely on if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c40a&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Scheme allows you to have &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; lazy evaluation, through the use of &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;thunks&lt;/em&gt; and mutations, which can be conveniently abstracted away so that you have call-by-need when you need it. That brings us to the next bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5cd4&quot; class=&quot;jl jm gm av jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki hi&quot;&gt;Mostly Functional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;08d8&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il kj im in io kk ip iq ir kl is it iu km iv iw ix kn iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Functional programming is great. Playing back functional code in your head is simple; the code is easy to read and the lack of mutations reassuring. Except when it isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ae12&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;I’m not a proponent of mutations willy-nilly, but I am a proponent of their judicious use. Like the example above of lazy evaluation, I can fully support the use of mutation to &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;implement&lt;/em&gt; a functional feature. Mutations exist at the periphery of all software. For some abstractions, the most expressive thing to do might be to pull in the mutation into a nice little abstraction. For example, a message passing bus is a mutation filled abstraction, but it can have very elegant purely functional pieces of code hanging off of them without having to carry around spurious state variables or assistive devices like monads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;53d9&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Like any tool, non-mutating code taken to the extreme can be harmful. A language that allows me judicious use of mutations to implement a large body of code in a more elegant fashion will always win high marks over a language that forces a (mostly good) construct in every situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8f5c&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;So, Scheme’s inherent bias towards no-mutations, but its “use it if you must” attitude towards mutations (or &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;side-effects&lt;/em&gt; as they are called) makes it a much more effective tool for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5081&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;I brought up monads above, so it’s a good idea to talk a little about them since they are the pure-functional way of gaining effects. Having written a Ph. D. thesis about them, I think I have some idea about them. I love the elegance and the sheer beauty of the Eugenio Moggi’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://person.dibris.unige.it/moggi-eugenio/ftp/ic91.pdf&quot; class=&quot;dn ko&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;original conception&lt;/a&gt; of Monads. The idea of separating a computation from the value produced by that computation and then reifying that computation into a type is &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;brilliant&lt;/em&gt; in every sense of the word. It’s a great way to mathematically understand the semantics of programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2a6e&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;As a programming tool, I have mixed emotions about it. It’s a complicated way of isolating effects and then threading them through your whole program, when you could easily create simple abstractions that make the rest of your program easier to work with. As an eminent type theorist (who shall remain nameless) once said “Monads are useful only every other Tuesday”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e6da&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Monads are assistive devices that are forced on to functional languages to provide a functional fence around side effects. The problem is that the fence is “infectious” and everything that touches the fence must now also be fenced and so on until you reach the end of the playground. So rather than face up to a side-effect and handling it elegantly in an abstraction, you’re now given a complex abstraction that you’re forced to carry with you everywhere. On top of that they don’t compose very well either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f268&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;I’m not arguing that Monads are completely useless. They do work well in some cases (“every other Tuesday”), and I do use them when they work. But when they are the sole mechanism with which to approach computations, they severely cripple the expressiveness of a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fb7f&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Which brings us to the next, and perhaps the most controversial opinion I hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b169&quot; class=&quot;jl jm gm av jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki hi&quot;&gt;Dynamically Typed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;891c&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il kj im in io kk ip iq ir kl is it iu km iv iw ix kn iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;The world today is going on and on about typed languages. TypeScript is considered a savior in the dogged world of JavaScript. Python and JavaScript are decried for their lack of static typing. Types are considered essential to documentation and communication in large programming projects. Engineering managers throw themselves at the feet of type inferencing to protect them from mediocre software engineers producing poor quality code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c3a1&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;There are two types of static typing. “Old-style” static typing is used in C, C++, Java, Fortran where the types are used by a compiler to produce more efficient code. Type checkers here are very restrictive, but don’t pretend to provide any guarantees beyond your basic type checking. They are, at least, &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;understandable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6c7b&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Then there’s the new kind of static typing with its roots in the Hindley-Milner type system which brought on a new beast: type inferencing. This gives you the illusion that not all types need to be declared, and if you’re playing by the rules, you’ll get the benefits of Old-style static typing, but also some cool new things like polymorphism. This view is also understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f238&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;But it has now taken a new interpretation in the last couple of decades: Static typing is a form of compile-time error checking, so it will help you produce better quality code. It is as if static typing is a magical theorem prover that will verify some deep properties of your program. This is where I call &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;bullsh*t.&lt;/em&gt; I have never had a static type checker (regardless of how sophisticated it is) help me prevent anything more than an obvious error (which should be caught in testing anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;75ea&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;What static type checkers do, however, is get in my way. Always. Without fail. As a programmer, I carry around &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;invariants&lt;/em&gt; (which is a fancy name for properties about things in my program) in my head all the time. Only &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of those invariants is the type of the thing. Having a tool that can verify that invariant is sort of cool, when you first encounter it (as I did with Miranda).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;62be&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;But it is a &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; tool. It can only do so much. So, you now end up with artificial rules about how to satisfy this tool. And things that I know (and can justify or even formally prove for my use cases) are perfectly fine to do are suddenly not. So now I must redesign my program to meet the needs of a limited tool. Most people are perfectly happy with this tradeoff, and they slowly change the way they think about software to fit within the confines of its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5c5d&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;In old Hindi movies, the censor board would not allow showing kissing on screen. So romantic scenes would always cut to flowers bumping against one another or a pair of birds flying away together or something silly like that. This is what static type checkers feel like. We get presented with a beautiful language that promises us the right to freedom of speech, but then we get slapped with a censorship board policing the speech, so then I have to say what I mean in metaphors and symbolisms for what is only marginal benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a763&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;What a &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; tool would do, is allow me to state and prove &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my invariants at compile time. This, of course, is ultimately unsolvable. So given the choice between a crappy tool (static type checkers) and no tool, I have always gravitated towards no tool since I prefer to not have any artificial constraints on my programs. Hence dynamic typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cff2&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;All programs (statically typed or otherwise) must deal with run-time exceptions. Well written programs run into fewer of those, badly written ones run into more of them. Static type checkers move some from the badly written camp to the somewhat well-written camp. What improves (and guarantees) software quality is &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;rigorous testing&lt;/em&gt;. To deliver high quality software, there is no other solution. So whether or not you do static typing only has a marginal effect on the quality of your software and even that effect vanishes when you have well designed programs written by thoughtful programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d290&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;In other words, static typing is pointless. It has, maybe, some documentary value, but it does not substitute documentation on other invariants. For example, your invariant might be something like I’m expecting here a monotonically increasing array of numbers with a mean value of such and such and a standard deviation of such and such. The best any static type checking will let you do is “array[float]”. The rest of your invariant must be expressed in words as a documentation of that function. So why subject yourself to the misery of “array[float]”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fd47&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Dynamic typing allows me to express what I want to express in my programs without getting in my way. I can specify my invariants either as explicit checks or as documentation depending upon the needs of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;62ee&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;But, like everything else, sometimes you need to know types statically. For example, I work a lot with images, and it helps to know that they are “array[byte]”, and I have pre-baked operations that will work magically fast on them. Scheme/Lisp/Racket all provide ways of being able to do this &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;when you need it&lt;/em&gt;. In Scheme it is implementation dependent, but Racket comes with a “Typed Racket” variant that can be intermixed with the dynamically typed variant. Common Lisp allows for types to be declared in specific contexts, primarily for the compiler to implement optimizations where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0efa&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;So, again, Scheme/Lisp/Racket allow me the benefits of types &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;when I need them&lt;/em&gt; but don’t force the constraints on me everywhere. It’s the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5c8f&quot; class=&quot;jl jm gm av jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki hi&quot;&gt;S-expression based&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e5ab&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il kj im in io kk ip iq ir kl is it iu km iv iw ix kn iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;And finally we come to one of the most important reasons for why I use Lisp. For those of you who have never heard the term s-expression before, it stands for a peculiar syntactic choice in Lisp and its children. All syntactic forms are either &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;atoms&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;lists&lt;/em&gt;. Atoms are things like names (symbols), numbers, strings and booleans. And lists look like “( … )” where the contents of the list are also either lists or atoms, and it is perfectly fine to have an empty list “()”. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;addf&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;There are no infix operations, no operator precedence, no associativity, no spurious separators, no dangling else’s, nothing. All function applications are prefix, so instead of saying “(a + b)”, you would say “(+ a b)”, which further allows you the flexibility of saying things like “(+ a b c)”. “+” is simply the name of a function that you can redefine if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;19ec&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;There are “keywords” that direct a given list to be evaluated in a certain way, but the rules of evaluation are hierarchical and well defined. In other words, s-expressions are effectively tree based representations of your programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1002&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;This simplicity of syntax is often confusing for newbies, and has probably turned off a lot of programmers who were unfortunate enough to not be exposed to the beauty of this way of writing programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e225&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;The biggest advantage of this form of syntax is a form of minimalism — you don’t need spurious syntactic constructs to convey concepts. Concepts are conveyed entirely by the function names or the syntactic keywords being used. This produces strangely compact code. Not always compact in terms of number of characters, but compact in terms of the number of concepts you need to keep in mind when reading the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c795&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;And that’s not even the half of it. If your programs are trees, you can write programs to manipulate those trees. Lispers (and Schemers and Racketeers) call these things &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;macros&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;syntactic extensions&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, you can &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/em&gt; the syntax of your language to introduce new abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;30d8&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;There are countless cool syntactic extensions written by generations of Lispers, including object systems, language embeddings, special purpose languages and what not. I have used this to develop syntactic features that allowed me to use Scheme to build things that span the gamut from sensor networks to digital signal processing, to e-commerce pricing strategies. There is not a single other language in the world that even comes close to supporting this level of syntactic extension, and it is something that I (and a host of other Lispers) cannot live without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4fb7&quot; class=&quot;jl jm gm av jn jo jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki hi&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5e63&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il kj im in io kk ip iq ir kl is it iu km iv iw ix kn iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;To boil it down, then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;ji jj jk&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0719&quot; class=&quot;ii ij jh ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;An s-expression based, dynamically typed, mostly functional, call-by-value λ-calculus based language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6b8b&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;This is why I still use Scheme/Racket/Lisp, and will probably use it for the rest of my life. Do I use other languages? Sure. Lots of them. None of them hold a candle to these. &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;Especially the newer ones.&lt;/em&gt; It appears that inventing new languages is an exercise each new generation of ill-informed software engineers goes through when older languages are &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better than any thing they might come up with even in their dreams (I present to you Ruby which although nominally has its roots in Lisp, begs the question: &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;why didn’t you just use Lisp itself&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5268&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Like every bias, mine has shortcomings too. Prior to about 15 years ago, all third party SDK’s were written entirely in C/C++ which could easily interoperate with Lisp. The coming of Java has put a damper on it since the JVM does not interoperate well with Scheme/Lisp/Racket. This has made it harder and harder to incorporate third party libraries into my programs without doing a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4a2b&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;Another shortcoming is that with the rise of API’s on the internet, most vendors release libraries in the common languages of the internet (Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and more recently Go and Rust), but never in Scheme/Lisp/Racket unless it is a community contribution and also equally infrequently in C/C++. So it often leaves me in a position of having to build an API layer myself which of course is not very practical. Racket (which is my current favorite), has a pretty active community that does contribute towards the big things, but it is usually behind the times a little and when it comes to the latest and greatest, I’m often left holding the bag. It might be the big reason I adopt Clojure in the future, but that remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d4f0&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;It has, of course, not deterred me yet. If anything, it has made me more aware that the Lisp community has to spread its word farther and wider and bring on a new generation of Lispers to fortify the eco-system in a rapidly changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4afe&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;And lastly, there’s the issue of performance. First, let’s put the common misconception to rest: Lisp is &lt;strong class=&quot;ik cu&quot;&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an interpreted language. It is &lt;strong class=&quot;ik cu&quot;&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; slow, and all implementations come with lots and lots of levers to tweak performance for &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; programs. In some cases the programs might need assistance from faster languages like &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;jh&quot;&gt;C++&lt;/em&gt; because they are closer to the hardware, but with faster hardware, even that difference is becoming irrelevant. These languages are perfectly fine choices for production quality code, and probably more stable than most other choices out there due to decades of work that has gone into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b3ac&quot; class=&quot;ii ij gm ik b il jc im in io jd ip iq ir je is it iu jf iv iw ix jg iy iz jb dh hi&quot;&gt;I do recognize, learning Scheme/Lisp/Racket is a wee bit harder than learning Python (but a lot easier than learning Java/JavaScript). You will, however, be a much better programmer if you do and you will come to appreciate the beauty of these languages in a way that nothing else will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

The first implementation: Red LackRack with Ethernet switch and table lamp&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First occurrence on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Winter&quot; title=&quot;Eth0:2010 Winter&quot;&gt;eth0:2010 Winterlan&lt;/a&gt;, the LackRack is the ultimate, low-cost, high shininess solution for your modular datacenter-in-the-living-room. Featuring the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270&quot;&gt;LACK&lt;/a&gt; (side table) from Ikea, the LackRack is an easy-to-implement, exact-fit datacenter building block. It's a little known fact that we have seen Google engineers tinker with Lack tables since way back in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LackRack will certainly make its appearance again this summer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Summer&quot; title=&quot;Eth0:2010 Summer&quot;&gt;eth0:2010 Summer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;

When temporarily not in use, multiple LackRacks can be stacked in a space-efficient way &lt;em&gt;without disassembly&lt;/em&gt;, unlike competing 19&quot; server racks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LackRack was first seen on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Winter&quot; title=&quot;Eth0:2010 Winter&quot;&gt;eth0:2010 Winterlan&lt;/a&gt; in the no-shoe Lounge area. Its low-cost and perfect fit are great for mounting up to 8 U of 19&quot; hardware, such as switches (see below), or perhaps other 19&quot; gear. It's very easy to assemble, and thanks to the design, they are stable enough to hold (for example) 19&quot; switches and you can put your bottle of Club-Mate on top! Multi-shiny LackRack can also be painted to your specific preferences and the airflow is unprecedented!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find a howto on buying a LackRack on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://mrngm.com/eth0/LackRack/&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. This includes the proof that a 19&quot; switch can indeed be placed in the LackRack in its natural habitat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

Illustration of the LackRack's modularity&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For assembly in terms of a programming language, this is not the page you need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in order to assemble the LackRack, there are a few prerequisites or tools that are needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 (or more) LACK side table from Ikea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screwdriver (whether muscle-driven or motor-driven, with preference of the latter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wood screws (they should fit in the rack mounts on your appliance, and not exceed 1&quot; in length)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spare time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's all! First, follow the assembly instructions in the Ikea manual in order to assemble the LACK. After that, the installation of your 19&quot; hardware can begin. When assembling a larger number of LACKs, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/IKEA_Hack_a_Lack/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; describes a useful tool for fitting the legs to the tabletop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LackRack is a stackable modular product. Additional elements can be stacked on top easily. Brackets to secure the top element to the bottom one are not included but available from your local non-computer hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you put several LackRacks side by side, the higher levels can be staggered to form a pyramid. This feature is not present in any other of the commercially available rack products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lackrack2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/7/76/Lackrack2.jpg&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;thumbimage&quot; data-file-width=&quot;1536&quot; data-file-height=&quot;2048&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

Due to their light weight design, Lackracks will grow to any required size without compromise&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing hardware in your LackRack is easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional but recommended&lt;/em&gt; - Put the table on its side (which one is your decision) or upside down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount the hardware between the left and right leg
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you mount the first item, it is recommended to install it against the table top for good fit. This happens automatically if you have the LackRack upside down, except in zero gravity environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screw all the screws that fit in the rack mount in the left and right leg (for stability).
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;With deep units, a Z-shaped bracket may be advisable to secure the rear of the unit against the underside of the tabletop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit! (note how &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.rackable.com&quot;&gt;lackable.com&lt;/a&gt; has been bought by sgi recently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current LACK tables have hollow legs; only the top 5 cm (2&quot;) is solid. Fitting equipment below the solid section may require the use of cavity plugs, such as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fischer-international.com/en/products/cavity-fixings/board-fixing/metal-cavity-fixing-hm/519772-hm-5-x-37-s&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Goodies&quot;&gt;Goodies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can put food and/or drink on your rack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can put a small lamp on top of the rack to see your hardware and/or better find the aforementioned food and drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The table can be painted in a color of your preference, or decorated in various ways. The eth0 Design team can advise, for a fee, how to optimally decorate the rack to suit your environment.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to colour-code your datacentre: e.g. &lt;span&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; for critical services, &lt;span&gt;grey&lt;/span&gt; for office automation, &lt;span&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; for file-servers, &lt;span&gt;black&lt;/span&gt; for systems and network management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks good!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Alternative_configuration&quot;&gt;Alternative configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

fitting the equipment to the rear of the front legs&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mounting the equipment to the rear of the front legs is recommended if you plan to fit switches with fiber uplinks; the created tabletop overhang shields the fiber connections from minor mishap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tright&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lack_alt2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/5/57/Lack_alt2.jpg&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; class=&quot;thumbimage&quot; data-file-width=&quot;768&quot; data-file-height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Q: Does the LackRack provide redundant power supply?
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A: Only if you add it yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Can I put my (coffee) mug on top and don't have to worry about it if I spill liquid on the LackRack?
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A: You can spill coffee on the LackRack, since it can be cleaned quite easily. However, if you have appliances &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; the LackRack, there is a chance that these appliances cannot handle the coffee (or any other liquid). You should take precautions in order to protect your appliances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Its size allows both short ends to be used as rack space simultaneously. It's interesting to note that Ikea photographed it from the side; an uncommon artistic approach to 19&quot; server rack photography. It provides for 8 U of hardware: 4 on either side of the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following ICT tradition, the Enterprise Edition is more than three times as expensive, while providing less stability than two of the regular products combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Ikea has strived to keep many of their products rack compatible since so many of them are capable of housing 19&quot; equipment.

<title>CDC website built by Deloitte at a cost of $44M is abandoned due to bugs</title>
<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/30/1017086/cdc-44-million-vaccine-data-vams-problems/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/30/1017086/cdc-44-million-vaccine-data-vams-problems/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Pang says he spent three weeks trying to sign into VAMS, but he constantly ended up in the dashboard for patients instead of clinic administrators. In the meantime, his staff was vaccinating hundreds of people a day and keeping track of their information on paper forms. The college set up a bank of volunteers to sit in a room and copy all the information into VAMS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the local hospital helped him get signed into the system. The clinic used it for three days. On the last day, 20 new volunteers came in ready to work. But they’d already signed into VAMS to get their mandatory shots, and there was no way to switch them from patient accounts to staff ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, they went back to paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A good system is easier to use than it is not to use. If people are writing this on paper, there’s something wrong,” says Stone. “How are you going to do 100 million shots in 100 days and have someone enter it all in by hand?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“There is zero way it’ll happen without help”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“VAMS is fussy&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; There’s days when VAMS works, and days when VAMS doesn’t work,” says Courtney Rowe, a pediatric urologist at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, who has been volunteering to monitor people for reactions after their shots. She takes it as an opportunity to help people get set up for their second appointments. “I basically function as tech support,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online sign-ups are especially challenging for older people, perhaps the worst group to beta-test a new system. Many seniors probably lost their internet access when libraries and senior centers closed; only 59% have broadband connections at home, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/internet-broadband/&quot;&gt;2019 Pew survey&lt;/a&gt;. While many states offer phone lines for making appointments, people around the country have complained about endless waits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s days when VAMS works, and days when VAMS doesn’t work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It won’t work on Internet Explorer; it only works in Chrome. The ‘Next’ button is all the way down and to the right, so if you’re on a cell phone, you literally can’t see it,” says Rowe. “In the first round, people using VAMS mostly had advanced degrees. If you’re 75 and someone asks you to log into VAMS, there is zero way it’ll happen without help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I spoke with Rowe, Connecticut opened up vaccinations to anyone over 70. Her prediction came true immediately. On the first day of a new vaccination clinic in Vernon, Connecticut, 204 vaccines were ready but only 52 seniors had made appointments in VAMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our residents, and those from around the state that we’re serving at this clinic, are frustrated, angry, and confused by the ineffectiveness of this registration system,” town administrator Michael Purcaro &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-elderly-vernon-vaccine-registration-struggles-20210122-yhao4senajd4lnxz4eu32f6okm-story.html&quot;&gt;said at a press conference&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elderly people aren’t the only ones who will struggle if vaccination requires online sign-up. Language barriers will become a significant problem, especially for non-native English speakers doing high-risk essential work. People in rural or poor urban areas often have limited access to the internet in the first place, a problem disproportionately affecting the same Black and Latino communities that have suffered the worst traumas of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are some real equity concerns,” says Stone. “What happens when you go to a city and 20% of the population can’t get the notices?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what went wrong? In an email, a CDC spokesperson defended the system and said that appointments are not randomly canceled, despite what many clinicians have claimed: the problem, she said, was user error. She also outlined several fixes that have been made in response to feedback. VAMS now includes warnings when administrators do something that might change patient appointments, for example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a sunny day in London in 2015, Kirk Rutter rode the Tube to Hammersmith Hospital in hopes of finally putting an end to his depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutter had lived with the condition off and on for years, but the burden had grown since the death of his mother in 2011, followed by a relationship break-up and a car accident the year after. It felt as if his brain was stuck on what he describes as “an automatic circuit”, repeating the same negative thoughts like a mantra: “‘Everything I do turns to crap.’ I actually believed that,” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit to Hammersmith was a preview. He would be returning the next day to participate in a study, taking a powerful hallucinogen under the guidance of Robin Carhart-Harris, a psychologist and neuroscientist at Imperial College London. Years of talking therapy and a variety of anti-anxiety medications had failed to improve Rutter’s condition, qualifying him for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-020-00001-5&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-021-00187-9/d41586-021-00187-9_18786738.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone was super nice, like really lovely, and especially Robin,” Rutter recalls. Carhart-Harris led him to a room with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, so researchers could acquire a baseline of his brain activity. Then he showed Rutter where he would spend his time while on the drug. Carhart-Harris asked him to lie down and played him some of the music that would accompany the session. He explained that he would have on hand a drug that could neutralize the hallucinogen, if necessary. Then the two practised a grounding technique, to help calm Rutter in the event that he became overwhelmed. Without warning, Rutter burst into tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I knew this was going to be unpacking a lot — I was carrying a bit of a load at the time,” Rutter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rutter returned the next day, one of the researchers handed him two pills containing a synthetic form of psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient found in magic mushrooms. Rutter lay down on the bed and put on headphones and an eye mask. Soon, images of Sanskrit text appeared to him. Later, he saw golden bejewelled structures. Then his mind went to work on his grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Imperial study was one of a spate of clinical trials launched over the past few years using illicit psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also known as molly or ecstasy) to treat mental-health disorders, generally with the close guidance of a psychiatrist or psychotherapist. The idea has been around for decades — or centuries in some cultures — but the momentum has picked up drastically over the past few years as investors and scientists have begun to champion the approach again (see ‘Psychedelics take flight’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure__caption sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Source: Dimensions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once dismissed as the dangerous dalliances of the counterculture, these drugs are gaining mainstream acceptance. Several states and cities in the United States are in the process of legalizing or decriminalizing psilocybin for therapeutic or recreational purposes. And respected institutions such as Imperial; Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland; the University of California, Berkeley; and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City have opened centres devoted to studying psychedelics. Several small studies suggest the drugs can be safely administered and might have benefits for people with intractable depression and other psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One clinical trial involving MDMA has recently ended, with results expected to be published soon. Regulators will then be considering whether to make the treatment available with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy could provide needed options for debilitating mental-health disorders including PTSD, major depressive disorder, alcohol-use disorder, anorexia nervosa and more that kill thousands every year in the United States, and cost billions worldwide in lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the strategies represent a new frontier for regulators. “This is unexplored ground as far as a formally evaluated intervention for a psychiatric disorder,” says Walter Dunn, a psychiatrist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who sometimes advises the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on psychiatric drugs. Most drugs that treat depression and anxiety can be picked up at a neighbourhood pharmacy. These new approaches, by contrast, use a powerful substance in a therapeutic setting under the close watch of a trained psychotherapist, and regulators and treatment providers will need to grapple with how to implement that safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00559-2&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-021-00187-9/d41586-021-00187-9_18786722.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The clinical trials that have been reported on depression have been done under highly circumscribed and controlled conditions,” says Bertha Madras, a psychobiologist at Harvard Medical School who is based at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. That will make interpreting results difficult. A treatment might show benefits in a trial because the experience is carefully coordinated, and everyone is well trained. Placebo controls pose another challenge because the drugs have such powerful effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are risks. In extremely rare instances, psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD can evoke a lasting psychotic reaction, more often in people with a family history of psychosis. Those with schizophrenia, for example, are excluded from trials involving psychedelics as a result. MDMA, moreover, is an amphetamine derivative, so could come with risks for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many researchers are excited. Several trials show dramatic results: in a study published in November 2020, for example, 71% of people who took psilocybin for major depressive disorder showed a greater than 50% reduction in symptoms after four weeks, and half of the participants entered remission&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR1&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some follow-up studies after therapy, although small, have shown lasting benefits&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR2&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR3&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes with a therapeutic, you look at the data and think, ‘It slightly moved the needle,’” says Jennifer Mitchell, a neurologist at the Weill Institute for Neurosciences at the University of California, San Francisco, who worked on the recently finished MDMA trial. “Then you see MDMA and you’re like, ‘Never mind that.’ It’s a very different effect size.” Rutter was so moved by his experience with psilocybin that he has consulted for one of the companies sponsoring trials of the compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rave new world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current wave of interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics is something of a renaissance. In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists published more than 1,000 articles on using psychedelics as a psychiatric treatment; the drugs were tested on around 40,000 people in total&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR4&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Then, as recreational use of the drugs spread, they were banned and the FDA constricted supplies for research. Only recently have neuroscientists and psychopharmacologists such as Carhart-Harris had the technology to start unpicking how they work in the brain. That has given them some insights as to how these compounds might help in psychiatric disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers started exploring the biological effects of psychedelics in the late 1990s, using neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR5&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; before and after volunteers used the drugs, or in conjunction with antagonists that dampen some of their effects. The studies show similarities in how brains respond to psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD, as well as to N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the active ingredient in ayahuasca, and to mescaline, a psychedelic compound derived from the peyote cactus. They all act on receptors for serotonin, a neurotransmitter that affects mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is also the target of the predominant class of psychiatric drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. It is now thought that these antidepressants work not by flooding the brain with the neurotransmitter, as was initially assumed, but by stimulating neuroplasticity — the brain’s ability to forge new neuronal connections. There is some evidence that psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, enhance neuroplasticity in animals&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR6&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and limited evidence suggests that the same might happen in human brains&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR7&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00187-9#ref-CR8&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Clinical studies also suggest that the biological effects work best in concert with human guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed intensity--high&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;figure__image&quot; alt=&quot;Re-enactment of a psilocybin therapy session at the COMPASS Pathways study centre in Bristol, UK&quot; data-src=&quot;//media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-021-00187-9/d41586-021-00187-9_18790752.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure__caption sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mr10&quot;&gt;The setting for a psilocybin therapy session (shown in this mock-up) must be carefully replicated for clinical trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: COMPASS Pathways&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs “activate a therapeutic, dreamlike state, intensifying sensory perception, and memories pop up like little films”, says Franz Vollenweider, a psychiatrist and neurochemist at the University Hospital of Psychiatry in Zurich, Switzerland, and one of the pioneers of the modern era of psychedelic research. He thinks that this receptive state of mind provides an opportunity to help people escape from rigid patterns of thought, not unlike Rutter’s automatic circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People get locked into disorders like depression because they develop this system of thinking which is efficient, but wrong,” says David Nutt, a psychopharmacologist at Imperial College London and an outspoken supporter of evidence-based reforms to government policies concerning illegal drugs. Psychiatry has a term for such thinking: rumination. The idea behind psychedelic therapy is that the receptive state that the drug confers opens the door to fresh ideas about how to think about the past and future, which the therapist can reinforce. “There is a growing evidence base to the principle that this is very much about a synergy between drug-induced hyper-plasticity and therapeutic support,” says Carhart-Harris, who trained with Nutt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/psychedelic-compound-in-ecstasy-moves-closer-to-approval-to-treat-ptsd-1.21917&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-021-00187-9/d41586-021-00187-9_18786736.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutter says his journey with Carhart-Harris was focused, but flexible. When Rutter first removed a pair of eye shades after the drug took effect, the therapist appeared “fractured” and seemed to have another eye in the centre of his forehead. “I should imagine I look quite strange to you now,” Carhart-Harris said. Rutter burst out laughing and Carhart-Harris joined him. When the laughter stopped, the two men started talking. Rutter wanted to discuss his resentments, which led to pondering about the word ‘relent’ and its etymology. Carhart-Harris looked it up for him on his laptop. “That was a lovely moment, actually,” Rutter says. He returned for a second session with a stronger dose of the drug, followed by a second MRI and an ‘integration’ session, to discuss the experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment “made me look at grief differently”, Rutter says. “It was a realization that actually it wasn’t helping, and letting go wasn’t a betrayal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing these drugs effectively and translating the clinical research into actual treatments will prove challenging, however. Two of the most closely watched studies have grappled with this. One is the recently completed MDMA trial, which was testing the approach in people with severe PTSD. It was a phase III study, usually the final stage before drug regulators decide whether to approve a treatment, and it involved 90 participants at 15 sites around the world. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a non-profit organization in San Jose, California, sponsored the study, but has not so far released the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the mental-health-care company COMPASS Pathways in London is running a phase IIb trial — testing different dosages of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the results won’t be simple. One concern revolves around controls. Most individuals given a placebo will know that they are not receiving a powerful hallucinogen. Some studies evaluating psychedelics have attempted to address this by giving people in the control group a pill containing niacin, which elicits a physical sensation — usually a flushing response in the skin. Mitchell says that some participants in her MDMA study who’ve been given the drug thought they received the placebo, while some taking the placebo believed that they had been given the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies’ designers must also tackle how important the non-drug aspects of the trial are to the results. These include the mindset of the individual going into the experience, and the environment in which it takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vibe is definitely hotel spa at the treatment rooms for the COMPASS study at Utrecht University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. There’s a Mexican-style blanket folded at the foot of a twin-size bed. Beanbag chairs hug a potted palm in the corner. And a poster of Van Gogh’s &lt;em&gt;Almond Blossom&lt;/em&gt; adorns one wall. All 24 sites in the study are similarly decorated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the training and experience of the therapists guiding both the dosing sessions and the drug-free integration sessions. COMPASS, which became a public company in September and earned a stock-market valuation exceeding US$1 billion, developed a five-tier training programme for therapists in its trial. Company co-founder and chief innovation officer Ekaterina Malievskaia says site investigators must adhere to the training if the company expects to win regulators’ approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madras goes further to say that the conditions of the trial will have to be replicated for any wider roll-out of the drugs. They “have to be approved under the stringent conditions in which they were investigated”, she says. But the path forward for mandating such conditions is unclear. For the US FDA, there is a mechanism to ensure that drugs are administered in a specific way: Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS. Through REMS, the agency can require prescribing physicians and pharmacists to be certified for a treatment strategy designed to mitigate the risks associated with a drug — such as addiction and dependency for opiate prescription. REMS could be used with psychedelics, Dunn says. The effect would be to bundle the delivery of the drug with the therapy component, and potentially certify practitioners. A source working on one of the trials says that discussions are under way with the FDA over whether therapists who administer the drugs ought to be trained, what that training might involve and whether therapist certification should be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certification could mean legitimizing therapists who have been ‘treating’ individuals with the drugs illegally for as long as 30 years. But some of these therapists might resist the advice, or the involvement, of a government that has driven them underground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/first-look-at-lsd-in-action-reveals-acid-trip-biochemistry-1.21377&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-021-00187-9/d41586-021-00187-9_18786724.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approvals still have a long way to go. Towards the end of 2020, MAPS reported in a news release that there are statistically significant differences in the response between the control and placebo groups in its MDMA trial (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.nature.com/362xsvp&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;http://go.nature.com/362xsvp&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;go.nature.com/362xsvp&lt;/a&gt;). But the company won’t say more about the results until it releases the full data some time this year. It is also recruiting for a second phase III study using MDMA therapy for people with moderate-to-severe PTSD, which it aims to complete before the end of the year. COMPASS expects to have results from its phase IIb study on psilocybin by that time, and the company says it is planning a phase III study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Malenka, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Stanford University in California who has studied MDMA’s effects on rodents, says he thinks that some psychedelic drugs will eventually earn approval as treatments for certain conditions. “They have potential to be — I want to use the right analogy — a part of our toolset for treating patients,” he says. But he warns against overzealousness, particularly a brand of evangelism he’s seen among some of the underground purveyors of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. “I don’t think they’re going to be miracle cures,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/magic-mushroom-drug-lifts-depression-in-first-human-trial-1.19919&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-021-00187-9/d41586-021-00187-9_18786730.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argues that the hypotheses for how the drugs might be working in the brain still need further research, and that investigating compounds that provide the same benefits without the hallucinatory effects could prove worthwhile in the long run. Others point out that SSRIs work for many individuals without clinicians fully understanding their mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the clinical work, however, Madras says she’s concerned by the studies’ size and design. She noted that many of them recruit people who have had previous experience taking psychedelics. Those who are attracted to this type of experience, she argues, might be more likely to say positive things about it. Nutt has said that working with experienced users of the drugs minimizes the chance of adverse events. But there are other potential confounders, according to Madras. “The consent forms tell you what the expectations are,” she says. “So there’s bias on the part of the subjects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rutter says that despite all that, he is convinced that the treatment he received in 2015 changed his life for the better. In the weeks after his sessions, he found himself wondering whether the automatic circuit would return. “I was terrified,” he says, “and I realized I’ve got a little bit of control over this, right?” The thought had never occurred to him before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week or so later, he was out with friends at a shopping centre and sensed the return of optimism and openness. “It felt like somebody had opened a window in a stuffy room.” Five years later, his depression has not returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Docker, Django, Traefik, and IntercoolerJS: My go-to stack for building a SaaS</title>
<link>https://www.simplecto.com/docker-django-traefik-intercoolerjs-is-my-stack-for-2021/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.simplecto.com/docker-django-traefik-intercoolerjs-is-my-stack-for-2021/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This article has been updated. It was previously dated for 2020. Very little has changed, but I call it out where needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you are wondering, that SaaS is Curabase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.curabase.com&quot;&gt;https://www.curabase.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;kg-bookmark-content&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curabase: We make it easy to curate, collaborate, and share bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curabase makes group bookmarking easier, the same way that Github eases the pain of software development collaboration easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kg-bookmark-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.curabase.com/static/images/curabase-opengraph-image.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently published some thoughts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplecto.com/docker-django-traefik-intercoolerjs-is-my-stack-for-2020/&quot;&gt;Django being a great framework for applications&lt;/a&gt;. This post expands on that to include the other pieces of infrastructure from development to production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used this stack (or ones that look a lot like it) to build small SaaS apps in 2018, 2019, 2020, and now in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-entire-stack&quot;&gt;My entire stack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux Server/VM Hosted anywhere (I like Azure, Digital Ocean, or Scaleway) &lt;em&gt;(edit: 2021 – I'm in the process of moving everything over to a dedicated server at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hetzner.com&quot;&gt;Hetzner&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker. Just plain docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traefik for reverse proxy and TLS with LetsEncrypt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgresql running in docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django in a container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercoolerjs for easy and slick Ajax-like front-end work &lt;em&gt;(Edit: 2021 - the creator of intercooler has released &lt;a href=&quot;https://htmx.org&quot;&gt;HTMX&lt;/a&gt;, the successor to IntercoolerJS.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentry for catching production bugs (easy three-lines added to your config)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitbucket pipelines for CI/CD &lt;em&gt;(Edit: 2021 - I no longer bother with CI / CD for personal projects. It it too much tooling for no benefit)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZeroTier for VPN/ControlPlane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For smaller projects I run tests locally in docker containers and then push directly into production. I  don't bother with full CI/CD because I don't need the complexity of it all. That said, I do like Bitbucket Pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.simplecto.com/content/images/2020/02/mytechstack.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;A simple diagram of my go-to tech stack
&lt;p&gt;Woah! that is a lot to unpack here. Let's visualize this another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtual Machine
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Docker
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Django
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volume mounted data disks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workers (Long-running django commands)
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volume mounted data disks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgres
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volume-mounted data disks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traefik&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero-Tier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this helpful? Let me know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hosting&quot;&gt;Hosting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your stuff needs a home (yes, even in the &quot;serverless&quot; world. LOL). My personal preferences are &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.com&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.do.co/c/c844c6492d23&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(affiliate link)&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://scaleway.com&quot;&gt;Scaleway&lt;/a&gt;. They each offer enough compute, networking options, storage, and basic services to build out proofs-of-concept or whatever you might need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another honorable mention here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hetzner.com&quot;&gt;Hetzner&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a good level of hardware, service and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-virtual-machines&quot;&gt;The Virtual Machines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those side projects and many enterprise applications, &lt;strong&gt;scale is not an issue&lt;/strong&gt;. That means that I will not serve thousands of simultaneous users or handling terabytes of data. Therefore I can get by on the smaller offerings – usually under $20/month. Even Azure (the most expensive of the three) offer their burstable VMs. Generally I like to go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/&quot;&gt;Scaleway's Developer line of servers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice that Kubernetes is missing from my stack? When scale is not an issue then you don't need Kubernetes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;docker-just-plain-docker-&quot;&gt;Docker. Just plain Docker.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not rely on the OS vendor (Ubuntu) to make sure that I run the latest Docker on new VMs. Therefore I use the nice little &lt;code&gt;curl|bash&lt;/code&gt; technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;curl -s https://get.docker.com | sudo bash&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cure one-liner will get the best and most recent version for your machine running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;traefik-for-reverse-proxy&quot;&gt;Traefik for Reverse Proxy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traefik has been a God-send since I found it. Nginx is great, but it was not built for the Docker universe. Traefik has two killer features that have saved me hours upon hours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automatic TLS with LetsEncrypt. Literally set-it-and-forget-it. With the right API keys and DNS provider you can also do verification with DNS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic no-reload configuration using docker labels. When you spin up new services Traefik will pickup the changes automatically because it listens to all Docker-related events. This makes it incredibly convenient to add, remove, or merge services as needed without any hassle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;My only comment on Traefik is that there is a bit of a learning curve. You have to decide how you want to configure it (config file, command line options, yaml, or docker labels, or use a combination!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another note here: I have already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplecto.com/traefik-2-0-docker-and-letsencrypt/&quot; title=&quot;Traefik 2 production ready configurations&quot;&gt;published my production configuations for Traefik&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;postgres-for-database&quot;&gt;Postgres for Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried and True, PostgreSQL has never let me down. I usually attach one of these containers to a project that needs it without any difficulty. I simply spin up the container, bind the ports, and then bind the data volume to my host disk. Done and Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dockercomposeyml&quot;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;version: '3.1'

services:

  db:
    container_name: postgres
    hostname: postgres
    image: postgres:11
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secretsonly
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    networks:
      - web

networks:
    web:
        external: true
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dockerized-django-for-web&quot;&gt;Dockerized Django for Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker deploys nicely in a container, and I have been doing it for a few years now. The benefits of matching your development environment to your production one cannot be overstated, and I have Docker to thank for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: 2021, I've got a reference Django project up that I use as my template for new projects: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation&quot;&gt;https://github.com/simplecto/django-reference-implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;django-commands-for-asynchronous-tasks&quot;&gt;Django commands for Asynchronous tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for asynchronous tasks I simply use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-management-commands/&quot;&gt;custom Django commands&lt;/a&gt; which are a part of the standard framework. The pattern here is a simple &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop with a &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; period. It polls the database for relevant actions and then does it's thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: 2021 - This has paid off in a big way. I have been running a website screenshot project for over a year now with this pattern. It takes about 1500 website screenshots per day. All of it is scheduled and managed by a Django command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That project lives here: https://github.com/simplecto/screenshots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;intercoolerjs-because-who-needs-the-complexity&quot;&gt;IntercoolerJS, because who needs the complexity?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to say about this, but that will have to go into a series of posts. The tldr; here that I use this lovely little javascript library along with jQuery (&lt;em&gt;yeah, it is 2020, and I still use jQuery&lt;/em&gt;) to make parts of my applications &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like single-page-apps but not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntercoolerJS keeps that old-school &quot;Ajax&quot; (remember that word) goodness and allows me to update the DOM with HTML from the backend. It is seamless, smooth, and really convenient for things like logins and small form updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly suggest you check it out: &lt;a href=&quot;https://intercoolerjs.org&quot;&gt;Learn more about IntercoolerJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit 2021: The creator has released &lt;a href=&quot;https://htmx.org&quot;&gt;HTMX&lt;/a&gt;, the successor to IntercoolerJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sentry-to-catch-production-errors&quot;&gt;Sentry to catch production errors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make mistakes. Lots of mistakes--but there is no need to show them to my users, right? Sentry gives me an easy and convenient way to capture production bugs as they happen. Some cool things about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open source-ish (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry&quot;&gt;relicensed here&lt;/a&gt;), so you can host yourself if that is your thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy few lines added to your &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; file in Django and that is it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tight integration to your Git repos and Issue tracking systems for full production defect traceability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nice thing is that you can disable it for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitbucket-pipelines-for-ci-cd&quot;&gt;Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: 2021 - I no longer use CI/CD for deployment of my one-man projects. It is too much tooling and complexity. I simply run tests with PyCharm and ship directly to production from my development machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many CI/CD offerings out there today, but I have been happy with Bitbucket's offering called Pipelines. They offer you a few hundred minutes free every month with the option to top-up as needed for a small fee. I have rarely had problems, and I really enjoy their YAML configuraiton / directive files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;bitbucket-pipelines.yml&lt;/code&gt; file I have been able to do full end-to-end testing by spinning up multiple docker containers, loading the databases, and running hundreds of test in just a few minutes. This was key in speeding things up in our team and enabling 5+ pushes to production per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org&quot;&gt;Checkout Bitbucket here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zerotier-for-vpn-control-plane&quot;&gt;ZeroTier for VPN/Control Plane&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to the bit of tech that is largely optional but nice to have.  Zerotier is a unique kind of network/VPN that I use to link all my personal machines. It works though firewalls (at home, in office) and offers an easy 1 minute setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ZeroTier in my last company we were able to remove the SSH Jump Servers which caused a headache in terms of key management and shared bandwidth on a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zerotier work on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone, so you are pretty much covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one downside to ZeroTier is that I don't entirely understand how it works. It is a lot like MacOS or iPhone in that it &quot;just works&quot; as expected and I rarely (never) have problems. That is a strength from a user experience perspective but a WTF? from a CTO perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this deeper-dive will prompt some interest and curiosity about Docker, Django, Traefik, and especially IntercoolerJS. It is simple, easy to work with, and allows you to grow out of it when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit 2021 - As you can see not a lot has changed. I've been able to add more code to my public repositories that flesh out the ideas expressed here over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
