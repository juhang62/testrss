<title>Cosmoteer: A starship design, simulation, and battle game</title>
<link>https://cosmoteer.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cosmoteer.net/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultimate starship designer,&lt;br/&gt;powered by a deep game simulation...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmoteer is a starship design, simulation, and battle game.&lt;/strong&gt; Design a fleet of ships by placing individual modules including weapons, shields, engines, and hallways. Battle A.I. starships to earn bounties or test your design skills against other players. A dynamic crew and combat simulation makes every design decision important and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;video&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeO9vsoqWrA?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;feature&quot;&gt;Best-In-Class Starship Designer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/gifs/ship_designer.gif&quot; class=&quot;inline_gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design the greatest starship ever made&lt;/strong&gt; using an interface that is easy-to-learn yet incredibly flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build your ship by placing individual modules&lt;/strong&gt; onto a grid—weapons, shields, engines, reactors, crew's quarters, and more! Few restrictions and no pre-defined, creativity-limiting hull shapes mean you can create almost any ship you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The exterior of a ship is like an artist's canvas,&lt;/strong&gt; but it requires no drawing ability to make your ship look great! Simply pick a color and texture to customize your ship's basic appearance, then optionally add decals such as shapes, symbols, and letters to give it extra visual flourish. Painting your ship is free and has no effect on gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/shipdesigner1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/shipdesigner1_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/shipdesigner2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/shipdesigner2_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/shipdesigner3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/shipdesigner3_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/painter1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/painter1_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;feature&quot;&gt;Intelligent Crew Simulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/gifs/crew_sim.gif&quot; class=&quot;inline_gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every starship is operated by a crew&lt;/strong&gt; numbering from half-a-dozen to hundreds—sometimes more than a thousand—of individually-simulated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ship's crew is its lifeblood.&lt;/strong&gt; Crew not only operate its controls, but they also carry supplies such as ammunition and power batteries to weapons and systems. When a weapon wants to shoot, the crew go pick up ammo or batteries at an ammo factory or reactor and bring them to the weapon—all simulated in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crew are pretty smart&lt;/strong&gt; and act mostly on their own, which is a good thing since there can be so many. Your crew are smart enough to figure out what controls need operating, what systems need ammo or power, and how best to get around your ship. They're even smart enough to avoid routes that are already jammed with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crew simulation is what makes starship design so interesting&lt;/strong&gt;, because how fast a cannon can shoot or how long a shield can stay charged &lt;em&gt;depends directly on how quickly crew can deliver ammo or power to it&lt;/em&gt;. As a player, you'll have to think carefully about how you design your ship's layout so that it operates at peak efficiency without exposing its more vulnerable (and sometimes explosive!) modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim1_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim3_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim2_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/crewsim4_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;feature&quot;&gt;Physics-Driven Flight &amp;amp; Combat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/gifs/combat.gif&quot; class=&quot;inline_gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every ship is part of a 2D physics simulation&lt;/strong&gt;, and the position and orientation of its thrusters realistically affects its movement. Small ships with lots of thrusters are fast and nimble, while large ships with proportionally fewer thrusters are naturally slower and more difficult to maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapons obey the laws of the physics simulation.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether or not a cannon or laser hits an enemy depends not on a dice roll but upon the trajectory of the shot and the size and speed of the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage is tracked module-by-module&lt;/strong&gt;, and each module can be individually targeted &amp;amp; destroyed. Some modules can explode, causing collateral damage to the surrounding modules, so you'll have to think carefully about where you place your reactors and munitions. Too close to the edge and they'll be exposed to enemy fire; too far and your weapons won't fire fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ships can break apart&lt;/strong&gt; into multiple pieces when their connecting modules are destroyed. Usually this will be a crippling blow, but any piece that has a control room, power, and thrusters can continue to operate independently, potentially remaining a threat to the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle1_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle4_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle3_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/battle2_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;feature&quot;&gt;Single-Player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/gifs/bounty_hunter.gif&quot; class=&quot;inline_gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a bounty hunter&lt;/strong&gt;, traveling from sector to sector, hunting down renegade enemies and destroying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earn money for every enemy vanquished&lt;/strong&gt;. Use your income to repair and upgrade your own fleet, growing bigger and more powerful with every victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore a galaxy&lt;/strong&gt; in search of bigger and more powerful enemies. The galaxy will crumble before your almighty armada!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or play in a creative sandbox mode&lt;/strong&gt; with unlimited credits if being a bounty hunter isn't your cup of Earl Grey—the only limit is your imagination! (And the power of your computer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty1_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty3_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty4_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/bounty2_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;feature&quot;&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/gifs/tactics.gif&quot; class=&quot;inline_gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle your friends and enemies in real-time&lt;/strong&gt;, pitting your designs against theirs. Compete to be the master &quot;Starship Architect &amp;amp; Commander&quot; against up to 7 other players in Team vs Team and Free For All battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure a variety of game options&lt;/strong&gt; by specifying number of ships, total funds, game speed, and other options. Play tiny skirmishes, massive fleet battles, or anywhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play online&lt;/strong&gt; in public or private lobbies. Local Area Network and direct I.P. address connections are also supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiplayer is NOT SUPPORTED between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer1_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer2_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer3_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;thumb&quot; src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/screenshots/multiplayer4_thumb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;feature&quot;&gt;And more!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cosmoteer.net/gifs/ships.gif&quot; class=&quot;inline_gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything you should expect from a PC game,&lt;/strong&gt; including customizable controls, windowed and borderless display modes, support for high-resolution displays, no mandatory locked framerates, and dozens of other options to tailor the game to your own preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's easy to share your ship designs&lt;/strong&gt; with friends and other players. Ships are saved as simple PNG image files and can be easily shared on social media like Twitter, Discord, and the official forums—just drag-and-drop the image from your browser right into Cosmoteer and the ship will be instantly playable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A powerful modding framework&lt;/strong&gt; lets mods change almost any part of the game data, opening up a universe of possibilities beyond the base game. A mods manager makes it easy to install and uninstall mods created by the Cosmoteer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unobtrusive tutorials&lt;/strong&gt; that don't interrupt gameplay and are easy to dismiss or turn off altogether. There's no special &quot;tutorial level&quot; you need to play through—the context-sensitive tips are built-in to the main Bounty Hunter mode.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>United States Files Civil Lawsuit Against Edward Snowden</title>
<link>https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/united-states-files-civil-lawsuit-against-edward-snowden</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/united-states-files-civil-lawsuit-against-edward-snowden</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;ALEXANDRIA, Va. – The United States today filed a lawsuit against Edward Snowden, a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), who published a book entitled &lt;em&gt;Permanent Record&lt;/em&gt; in violation of the non-disclosure agreements he signed with both CIA and NSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Snowden published his book without submitting it to the agencies for pre-publication review, in violation of his express obligations under the agreements he signed. Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that Snowden has given public speeches on intelligence-related matters, also in violation of his non-disclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;The United States’ lawsuit does not seek to stop or restrict the publication or distribution of &lt;em&gt;Permanent Record&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, under well-established Supreme Court precedent, &lt;em&gt;Snepp v. United States,&lt;/em&gt; the government seeks to recover all proceeds earned by Snowden because of his failure to submit his publication for pre-publication review in violation of his alleged contractual and fiduciary obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;The lawsuit also names as nominal defendants the corporate entities involved in publishing Snowden’s book. The United States is suing the publisher solely to ensure that no funds are transferred to Snowden, or at his direction, while the court resolves the United States’ claims. Snowden is currently living outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;“Intelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “This lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;“Edward Snowden has violated an obligation he undertook to the United States when he signed agreements as part of his employment by the CIA and as an NSA contractor,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “The United States’ ability to protect sensitive national security information depends on employees’ and contractors’ compliance with their non-disclosure agreements, including their pre-publication review obligations. This lawsuit demonstrates that the Department of Justice does not tolerate these breaches of the public’s trust.  We will not permit individuals to enrich themselves, at the expense of the United States, without complying with their pre-publication review obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;This lawsuit is separate from the criminal charges brought against Snowden for his alleged disclosures of classified information. This lawsuit is a civil action, and based solely on Snowden’s failure to comply with the clear pre-publication review obligations included in his signed non-disclosure agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;This matter is being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;The claims asserted by the United States are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtejustify&quot;&gt;A copy of this press release may be found on the website of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao/vae&quot;&gt;U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Emergent Tool Use from Multi-Agent Interaction</title>
<link>https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We've observed agents discovering progressively more complex tool use while playing a simple game of hide-and-seek. Through training in our new simulated hide-and-seek environment, agents build a series of six distinct strategies and counterstrategies, some of which we did not know our environment supported. The self-supervised emergent complexity in this simple environment further suggests that multi-agent co-adaptation may one day produce extremely complex and intelligent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;btns&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/emergent-tool-use/paper/Multi_Agent_Emergence_2019.pdf&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-padded icon-paper&quot;&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/multi-agent-emergence-environments&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-padded icon-code&quot;&gt;Environment Generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/mujoco-worldgen&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-padded icon-code&quot;&gt;Worldgen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our environment, agents play a team-based hide-and-seek game. Hiders (blue) are tasked with avoiding line-of-sight from the seekers (red), and seekers are tasked with keeping vision of the hiders. There are objects scattered throughout the environment that hiders and seekers can grab and lock in place, as well as randomly generated immovable rooms and walls that agents must learn to navigate. Before the game begins, hiders are given a preparation phase where seekers are immobilized to give hiders a chance to run away or change their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Only the team that locked an object can unlock it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no explicit incentives for agents to interact with objects in the environment; the only supervision given is through the hide-and-seek objective. Agents are given a team-based reward; hiders are given a reward of &lt;samp&gt;+1&lt;/samp&gt; if all hiders are hidden and &lt;samp&gt;-1&lt;/samp&gt; if any hider is seen by a seeker. Seekers are given the opposite reward, &lt;samp&gt;-1&lt;/samp&gt; if all hiders are hidden and &lt;samp&gt;+1&lt;/samp&gt; otherwise. To confine agent behavior to a reasonable space, agents are penalized if they go too far outside the play area. During the preparation phase, all agents are given zero reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;autocurriculaandemergentbehavior&quot;&gt;Autocurricula and emergent behavior&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As agents train against each other in hide-and-seek, &lt;strong&gt;as many as six distinct strategies emerge&lt;/strong&gt;. Each new strategy creates a previously nonexistent pressure for agents to progress to the next stage. Note that there are no direct incentives for agents to interact with objects or to explore; rather, the emergent strategies shown below are a result of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00742.pdf&quot;&gt;autocurriculum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; induced by multi-agent competition and the simple dynamics of hide-and-seek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;traininghideandseekagents&quot;&gt;Training hide-and-seek agents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the same training infrastructure and algorithms used to train &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/&quot;&gt;OpenAI Five&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity&quot;&gt;Dactyl&lt;/a&gt;. However, in our environment each agent acts independently, using its own observations and hidden memory state. Agents use an entity-centric state-based representation of the world, which is &lt;em&gt;permutation invariant&lt;/em&gt; with respect to objects and other agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each object is embedded and then passed through a masked residual self attention block, similar to those used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf&quot;&gt;transformers&lt;/a&gt;, where the attention is over objects instead of over time. Objects that are not in line-of-sight and in front of the agent are masked out such that the agent has no information of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agent policies are trained with &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/competitive-self-play/&quot;&gt;self-play&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/&quot;&gt;Proximal Policy Optimization&lt;/a&gt;. During optimization, agents can use privileged information about obscured objects and other agents in their value function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that large scale training was critical in agents progressing through the various stages of emergence. Below we show both the time and number of episodes it takes agents to reach stage 4 (ramp defense) for various batch sizes. We find increasing batch size gives a drastic speedup in wall-clock time to convergence, though doesn’t affect the sample efficiency greatly at or above 32k. However, we found that batch sizes of 8k and 16k never reached stage 4 in the allotted number of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;increasingbatchsizespeedsuptimetoconvergence&quot;&gt;Increasing batch size speeds up time to convergence&lt;/h5&gt;

Note: We report batch size in number of contiguous chunks of transitions used in backpropagation through time, each of which contains 10 transitions, meaning that a reported batch size of 64k actually contains 640k transitions.

&lt;p&gt;In this work we show evidence that agents learn complex strategies and counterstrategies through a self-supervised autocurriculum in hide-and-seek. Another method to learn skills in an unsupervised manner is &lt;em&gt;intrinsic motivation&lt;/em&gt;, which incentivizes agents to explore with various metrics such as model error or state counts. We ran count-based exploration in our environment, in which agents keep an explicit count of states they’ve visited and are incentivized to go to infrequently visited states. The primary modeling choice to tune in this setting is the state representation; for instance, in our first baseline we only include 2-D box positions in the state, such that agents are only incentivized to interact with and move boxes to novel positions. We then compare this to a count-based policy which takes the full state given to the agents that play hide-and-seek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, agents trained in hide-and-seek qualitatively center around far more human interpretable behaviors such as shelter construction, whereas agents trained with intrinsic motivation move objects around in a seemingly undirected fashion. Furthermore, as the state space increases in complexity, we find that intrinsic motivation methods have less and less meaningful interactions with the objects in their environment. For this reason, we believe multi-agent competition will be a more scalable method for generating human-relevant skills in an unsupervised manner as environments continue to increase in size and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;transferandfinetuningasevaluation&quot;&gt;Transfer and fine-tuning as evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, we qualitatively compare behaviors learned in hide-and-seek to those learned with intrinsic motivation. However, as environments increase in scale, so will the difficulty in qualitatively measuring progress. Tracking reward is an insufficient evaluation metric in multi-agent settings, as it can be ambiguous in indicating whether agents are improving evenly or have stagnated. Metrics like ELO or Trueskill can more reliably measure whether performance is improving relative to previous policy versions or other policies in a population; however, these metrics still do not give insight into whether improved performance is caused by new adaptations or improving previously learned skills. Finally, using environment-specific statistics such as object movement can also be ambiguous (for example, the choice to track absolute movement does not illuminate which direction agents moved), and designing sufficient metrics will become difficult and costly as environments scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose using a suite of domain-specific intelligence tests that target capabilities we believe agents may eventually acquire. Transfer performance in these settings can act as a quantitative measure of representation quality or skill, and we compare against pretraining with count-based exploration as well as a trained from scratch baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;d-flex h-100 flex-column justify-content-between&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;color-fg&quot;&gt;Sequential lock&lt;/strong&gt; The agent must lock boxes in an order unobserved to the agent. Boxes can only be locked in the correct order, so the agent must remember the status of boxes it has seen.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;d-flex h-100 flex-column justify-content-between&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;color-fg&quot;&gt;Blueprint construction&lt;/strong&gt; The agent must move boxes to the target locations.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the hide-and-seek agent performs better on many of the transfer tasks, it does not drastically improve performance or convergence time. From viewing its behavior, we know it has the latent skill to move objects in a precise manner to construct shelter in the hide-and-seek game; however, it does not have the capability to use this skill in other contexts when trained with a low number of samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the cause for the mixed transfer results is rooted in agents learning skill representations that are entangled and difficult to fine-tune. As future environments become more diverse and agents must use skills in more contexts, we believe we will see more generalizable skill representations and more significant signal in this evaluation approach. We additionally open-source the evaluation tasks as a way to evaluate learning progress in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;surprisingbehaviors&quot;&gt;Surprising behaviors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve shown that agents can learn sophisticated tool use in a high fidelity physics simulator; however, there were many lessons learned along the way to this result. Building environments is not easy and it is quite often the case that agents find a way to exploit the environment you build or the physics engine in an unintended way.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox moving to 4 week releases</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/moving-firefox-to-a-faster-4-week-release-cycle/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/09/moving-firefox-to-a-faster-4-week-release-cycle/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We typically ship a major Firefox browser (Desktop and Android) release every 6 to 8 weeks. Building and releasing a browser is complicated and involves many players. To optimize the process, and make it more reliable for all users, over the years we’ve developed a phased release strategy that includes ‘pre-release’ channels: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox Nightly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Developer Edition&lt;/a&gt;. With this approach, we can test and stabilize new features before delivering them to the majority of Firefox users via general release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today’s announcement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today we’re excited to announce that we’re moving to a four-week release cycle! We’re adjusting our cadence to increase our agility, and bring you new features more quickly. In recent quarters, we’ve had many requests to take features to market sooner. Feature teams are increasingly working in sprints that align better with shorter release cycles. Considering these factors, it is time we changed our release cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Q1 2020, we plan to ship a major Firefox release every 4 weeks. Firefox ESR release cadence (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/enterprise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Extended Support Release&lt;/a&gt; for the enterprise) will remain the same. In the years to come, we anticipate a major ESR release every 12 months with 3 months support overlap between new ESR and end-of-life of previous ESR. The next two major ESR releases will be ~June 2020 and ~June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorter release cycles provide greater flexibility to support product planning and priority changes due to business or market requirements. With four-week cycles, we can be more agile and ship features faster, while applying the same rigor and due diligence needed for a high-quality and stable release. Also, we put new features and implementation of new Web APIs into the hands of developers more quickly. (This is what we’ve been doing recently with CSS spec implementations and updates, for instance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain quality and minimize risk in a shortened cycle, we must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure Firefox engineering productivity is not negatively impacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed up the regression feedback loop from rollout to detection to resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to control feature rollout based on release readiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure adequate testing of larger features that span multiple release cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have clear, consistent mitigation and decision processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Firefox rollouts and feature experiments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a shorter Beta cycle, support for our pre-release channel users is essential, including developers using Firefox Beta or Developer Edition. We intend to roll out fixes to them as quickly as possible. Today, we produce two Beta builds per week. Going forward, we will move to more frequent Beta builds, similar to what we have today in Firefox Nightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staged rollouts of features will be a continued best practice. This approach helps minimize unexpected (quality, stability or performance) disruptions to our release end-users. For instance, if a feature is deemed high-risk, we will plan for slow rollout to end-users and turn the feature off dynamically if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to foster a culture of feature experimentation and A/B testing before rollout to release. Currently, the duration of experiments is not tied to a release cycle length and therefore not impacted by this change. In fact, experiment length is predominantly a factor of time needed for user enrollment, time to trigger the study or experiment and collect the necessary data, followed by data analysis needed to make a go/no-go decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the shorter release cycles, we will do our best to localize all new strings in all locales supported by Firefox. We value our end-users from all across the globe. And we will continue to delight you with localized versions of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firefox release schedule 2019 – 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox engineering will deploy this change gradually, starting with Firefox 71. We aim to achieve 4-week release cadence by Q1 2020. The table below lists Firefox versions and planned launch dates. Note: These are subject to change due to business reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-33809&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/09/4-week-release-cycle-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;a table showing the release dates for Firefox GA and pre-release channels, 2019-2020&quot; width=&quot;852&quot; height=&quot;990&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/4-week-release-cycle-blog.png 852w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/4-week-release-cycle-blog-250x290.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/4-week-release-cycle-blog-768x892.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/09/4-week-release-cycle-blog-500x581.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process and product quality metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we slowly reduce our release cycle length, from 7 weeks down to 6, 5, 4 weeks, we will monitor closely. We’ll watch aspects like release scope change; developer productivity impact (tree closure, build failures); beta churn (uplifts, new regressions); and overall release stabilization and quality (stability, performance, carryover regressions). Our main goal is to identify bottlenecks that prevent us from being more agile in our release cadence. Should our metrics highlight an unexpected trend, we will put in place appropriate mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, projects that consume Firefox mainline or ESR releases, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;SpiderMonkey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; will have to do more frequent releases if they wish to stay current with Firefox releases. These Firefox releases will have fewer changes each so they should be correspondingly easier to integrate. The 4-week releases of Firefox will be the most stable, fastest, and best quality builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, we hope you’ll enjoy the new faster cadence of Firefox releases.

&lt;p id=&quot;bzdropcap&quot;&gt;Raising prices should not be an 18-month project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is faced with the decision to raise prices at some point. It sucks, but in some cases you have to do it. Most companies, especially SaaS businesses, will look at their revenue forecasts, see a dip, run a calculation predicting the difference between the revenue increase and how many customers might leave, and then raise prices if the math looks favorable. Backblaze is not most companies — here’s how we did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February of 2019, we made the announcement that one month later, our prices for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Personal Backup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/business-backup.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Business Backup services&lt;/a&gt; would be going up by $1: our first price increase for our Computer Backup service since launching the service over a decade ago. What was announced in February 2019 actually started in December 2016, more than two years before the actual price increase would take effect. Why the long wait? We wanted to make sure that we did it right, not just mechanically (there’s a lot of billing code that has to change), but also in how we communicated to our customers and took them through the process. Oh, and a big reason for the delay was our main competitor leaving the consumer space, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I’ll dive in to our process for how we wanted the price increase to go, why we decided to build the extension program for existing customers, what went in to our communication strategy, and what the reactions were to the price increase, including looking at churn numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Raising Prices a Smart Move?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising prices, especially on a SaaS product where you’ve built a following, is never an easy decision. There are a ton of factors that come into play when considering what, if any, is the best course of action. Each factor needs to be considered individually and then as a whole to determine whether the price increase will actually benefit the business long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Raise Prices?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why companies raise prices. Typically it’s to either increase revenue or adjust to the market costs (the total cost associated with providing goods or services) in their sector. In our case it was the latter. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-computer-backup-pricing-change/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;price increase announcement&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed our reasoning in-depth, but it boiled down to two things: 1) adjusting to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-cost-per-gigabyte/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;market cost of storage&lt;/a&gt; (it was no longer decreasing at the rate it was when we first launched the product), and 2) we had spent years enhancing the service and making it easier for people to store more and more data with us, thereby increasing our costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core values of Backblaze is to make backup &lt;em&gt;astonishingly easy and affordable&lt;/em&gt;. Maintaining a service that is easy to use, has predictable pricing, and takes care of the heavy lifting for our customers was and is very important to us. When we started considering increasing prices we knew that we were going to be messing with the &lt;em&gt;affordable&lt;/em&gt; part of that equation, but it was time for us to adjust to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Raise Prices?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies say that they love their customers, and many actually do. When we first started discussing exactly how we were going to raise prices we rejected the easiest path, which was to create a pricing table, update the website, and flip a switch. That was the easy way, but it was important for us to do something for the customers who have trusted us with their important files and memories throughout the years. We would still need to build out the pricing table (&lt;em&gt;fun fact&lt;/em&gt;: from 2008 to 2017 our prices were hard-coded) but we started thinking about creating an extension program for our existing customers and fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Extension Program&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension program was a way for existing Backblaze users to prepay for one year of service, essentially delaying their price increase. They would buy 12 months of &lt;em&gt;backup credits&lt;/em&gt; for $50 for each computer on their account, and after those credits were used up, the new prices would go into effect on their next renewal. It was a way to say thank you to our existing customers, but there was just one problem — it didn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the extension program became a six month project in and of itself. First we needed to build a crediting system. Then, we needed to build the mechanism for our customers to actually &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; that block of credits and have them applied to their account. Afterwards, we’d need FAQs, confirmation emails, and website changes to help explain the program to our customers. This became a full-time job for a handful of our most senior engineers, and resulted in a six month project &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; we were ready to put it through our QA testing. The long development time of the project was a large point of consideration, but there were also financial implications that we had to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension program was great for customers, but good/bad for Backblaze. Why? By allowing folks to sign up for an extension we were essentially delaying their price increase, therefore delaying our ability to collect the additional revenue. While that was not ideal, the extension program brought in additional revenue from people purchasing those extensions, which was good. However, since those purchases were for credits, that additional revenue was deferred, and we still had to provide the service. So, while good from a cash flow perspective (we moved up about $2M in cash), we had to be very careful about how we accounted for and earmarked that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Continuing to Provide Value&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions were only part of the puzzle. We didn’t want customers to feel like we were simply raising prices to line our pockets. Our goal is to continue making backup easy and affordable, and we wanted to show our fans that we were still actively developing the service. The simplest way to show forward progress is to make…forward progress. We decided that before the announcement date we needed to have a product release that substantially improved the backup service, and that’s when we started to plan Backblaze Version 5.0, what we dubbed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-backup-5-0-rapid-access/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rapid Access Release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the development time of creating extensions were the projects to speed up both the backup and restore functions of the Backblaze app (those changes were good for customers, but actually increased our cost of providing the service). In addition, customers could now preview, access, and share backed up files by leveraging our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;B2 Cloud Storage product&lt;/a&gt;. To top it off we strengthened our security by adding ToTP as a two-factor verification method. All those features were rolled up into the 5.0 release and were released a few weeks before we were set to announce our price increase, which was scheduled to be announced on August 22nd, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Oversharing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of our core values is open communication, which we equate to being as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/transparency-in-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;open as possible&lt;/a&gt;. If you have followed Backblaze over the years, you know that we’ve open sourced our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/open-source-data-storage-server/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;storage pod&lt;/a&gt; design, shared our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;hard drive failure statistics&lt;/a&gt;, and have told entertaining stories about how we survived the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/farming-hard-drives-2-years-and-1m-later/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Thailand drive crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and the time we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-online-backup-almost-acquired-breaking-down-the-breakup/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;almost acquired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Most companies would never talk about topics like these, but we don’t shy away from hard conversations. In keeping with that tradition, we made the decision to be honest in our announcement about why we were raising prices (market costs and our own enhancements). We also made the decision to not mention one valid reason: inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our price back in 2008 was $5/month. With the inflation rate, in 2019 that would be around $5.96, so our price increase to $6 was right in-line with the inflation rate. So why not talk about it? We wanted the conversation to be about &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; business and the benefits that we’re providing for our customers in building a service that they feel is a good value. Bringing up global economics seemed like an odd tactic, considering that we weren’t even keeping up with inflation and ultimately customers got there on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Mikie 🇪🇺 (@mikieos) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikieos/status/1096014896955822080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disaster and Opportunity Strike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started down the increase path in 2016. In 2017, we designed and released version 5.0, we built and tested our extension program, we lined up our blog post, we wrote up FAQs, and we created customer service emails to let people know what was happening. After all that, we were ready to announce the following month’s price increase at 10am Pacific Time on August 22nd, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 22nd, at 8am, we pulled the plug and cancelled the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Happened?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early that morning news broke that our main competitor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16184430/crashplan-home-shutting-down&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Crashplan, was leaving the consumer backup space&lt;/a&gt;. You may be saying: Wait a minute, a main competitor is leaving the market and you have a mechanism to increase your prices in place — that sounds like the perfect day to raise prices! Nope. Another one of our values, is to be fair &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; good. Raising prices on a day when consumers found out that there were fewer choices in the market felt predatory and ultimately gross. Once we saw the news, we got in a room, quickly decided that we couldn’t raise prices for at least 6 months, and instead we would write a quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/crashplan-alternative-backup-solution/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; inviting orphaned customers to give us a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year following Crashplan’s announcement we saw a huge increase in customers, which is simultaneously good and bad. It was good because of the increased revenue from our newfound customers, but less ideal from an operations perspective, as we were not anticipating an influx of customers. In fact, we were anticipating an increase in churn coinciding with our cancelled price increase announcement. That meant we had to scramble to deploy enough storage to house all of the new incoming data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wouldn’t revisit the price increase until a year after the Crashplan announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That decision was not without financial repercussions. Put simply, we gave up $10 per customer per year. And, the decision affected not only our existing customers on August 22nd, but also all of those we would gain over the coming months and years. While this doesn’t factor in potential churn and other variables, when the size of our customer base is fully accounted for, the revenue left on the table was significant. In purely financial terms, raising prices on the day when the industry started having fewer options would have been the right &lt;em&gt;financial&lt;/em&gt; decision, but not the right &lt;em&gt;Backblaze&lt;/em&gt; decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hindsight Is 20/20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, releasing version 5.0 earlier that month was a happy accident. What originally was intended to show forward progress to our existing customers was now being looked at by a lot of new customers and prospects as well. The speed increase that we built into the app as part of the release made it possible for people exiting Crashplan’s service to transition to us and get fully backed up more quickly. Because these were people who understood the importance of keeping a backup, having no downtime in their coverage was a huge benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking Up Where We Left Off — The Price Increase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around August of 2018, we decided that enough time had passed and we were comfortable dusting off our price increase playbook. The process proved harder than we thought as we uncovered edge-cases that we had missed the first time around — another happy accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem With Long Development Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new plan was to announce the price increase in December and raise prices in January 2019. When we started unpacking our playbook and going over the plan, we realized that the simple decisions we had made over a year ago were either flawed or outdated. A good example of this was how we would treat two-year licenses. At one point in the original project spec, we decided that we were simply going to slide the renewal date by one year for anyone with a two-year license that purchased an extension, pushing their actual renewal date out a year. Upon thinking about it again, we realized this would cause a lot of customer issues and had to re-do the entire plan for two-year customers, a large part of our install base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we did have project sheets and spec documents, we also realized that we had lost a lot of the in the moment knowledge that comes in project development. We found ourselves constantly saying things like, “why did we make this choice,” and “are we sure that’s what we meant here?” The long gap between the original project start date and the day we picked it back up meant that the ramp-up time for the extension program was a lot longer than we expected. We realized that we wouldn’t be able to announce the price increase in December, with prices going up at the start of the year: we needed more time, both to QA the extension program and create version 6.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Version 6.0&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the original playbook was to provide value for customers by releasing version 5.0, and we wanted to stick to the original plan. We started thinking about what it would take to have another meaningful release and version 6.0, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-cloud-backup-v6/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Larger Longer Faster Better release&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we doubled the size of physical media restores, allowing people to get back more of their data more quickly and affordably (this was an oft-requested change, and one that is an example of a good-for-the-customer feature that incurs Backblaze extra costs). We leveraged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;B2 Cloud Storage&lt;/a&gt; again and built in functionality that would allow people to save their backed up data to B2, building off of the previous year’s preview and share capabilities. We made the service more efficient, increased backup speeds again, and also added network management tools. Looking past the Mac and PC apps, we also revamped our mobile offerings by refreshing our iOS and Android apps. All of that added development time again, and our new time table for the price increase was a February 2019 announcement, with the price increase going into effect in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wait a Minute…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be saying, you released version 5.0 in a run-up to a price increase, then scrapped it, and then released version 6.0 in a run-up to a price increase. Does that mean that every new version number increase will be followed by a price increase? Absolutely not. The first five versions of Backblaze didn’t precipitate a price increase, and we’re already hard at work on version 7.0 with no planned price increases on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Price Increase Announcement&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been subjected to price increases that were clandestine, then abruptly announced and put into effect the same day, or were not well explained. That never feels great and we really wanted to give customers one month of warning before the prices actually increased. That would give people time to buy the extensions that we worked so hard to build. Conversely, if people were on monthly licenses, or had a renewal date coming up after the price increase went into effect, it would give them an opportunity to cancel their service ahead of the increase. Of course we didn’t want anyone to leave, but realized that any change in our subscription plans would cause a stir and people who were more price-sensitive would likely have second thoughts about renewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goal was to be as communicative as possible. We wanted our customers to know exactly what we were doing, why we were doing it, and we didn’t want anyone to fall through the cracks of not knowing that this was happening. That meant writing a blog post, creating emails for all Personal Backup customers and Group administrators, and even briefing some members of the press and reviews sites who’d need to update their pricing tables. It might seem silly to &lt;em&gt;pitch&lt;/em&gt; the press on a price increase (something that is usually a negative event), but we’ve had some wonderful relationships develop with journalists over the years and it felt like the right thing to do to let them know ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all of those things were in back in place, it was time to press go, this time for real. The price increase was announced on February 12th and went into effect March 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Reaction &amp;amp; Churn Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Customer Reaction — Plan for the Worst, Hope for the Best&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t expect the response to be positive. Planning is great, but you never know exactly what’s going to happen until it’s actually happening. We were ready with support responses, FAQs, and a communications plan in case the response was overwhelmingly negative, but were lucky and that didn’t turn out to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers wrote to us and said, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;. Some people went out of their way to express how relieved they were that we were finally going to raise prices, concerned that we had been burning cash over the years. Other sentiments made it clear that we communicated the necessity for the increase and priced it correctly, saying that a $1 increase after 12 years is more than fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the press picked up the story, they had similar sentiments. Yes, it was news that Backblaze was increasing prices, but the reports were positive and very fair. One of the press members that we sent the news to early responded with: “Seems reasonable…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were of course some people who were angry and annoyed, and while some of our customers did come to our defense, we did see an increase in churn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Churn Rate Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months we monitored churn carefully to see the true impact on our existing customers from the price increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time a person leaves Backblaze we send one final email thanking them for their time with us, wishing them well, and asking if they have any feedback. Those emails go directly into our ticketing system where I read all of them every month to get a picture of why people are leaving Backblaze. Sometimes they are reasons we cannot address, but if we can, they go on our roadmap. After the price increase we’ve seen about a 30 percent increase in people saying that they are leaving for &lt;em&gt;billing reasons&lt;/em&gt;. It makes sense that more people are citing the price increase as they leave Backblaze, but we’ve had a lot of positive feedback as well from the issues we addressed in versions 5.0 and 6.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the people who didn’t necessarily write back to our email? We dove deep into the analytics and found that our typical consumer backup service churn rate six months before announcing the price increase was about 5.38 percent. The six months after announcement saw a churn rate of 5.75 percent, which indicates an increase in churn of about 7 percent. In our estimates we anticipated that number being a bit higher for the first year and then coming back down to historical averages after the bulk of our customers had their first renewal at the new price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Customer Acquisition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People leaving the service after you increase prices is only half of the equation. The other half lies in your new customer acquisition. Due to the market having competition, raising prices can cause prospective customers to look elsewhere when comparing products. This number was a bit hard for us to calculate since the year prior our biggest competitor for our consumer service went out of business. The best comparable we had was to look at 2017 versus. 2019. We went back to 2017 to look at the historical data and found that even with the increase, and six months afterwards, two year growth rate of our Personal Backup service was a healthy 42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned From Raising Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot during this whole process. One of the most important lessons is treating your customers well and not taking them for granted. At the outset we’d sometimes say things like, “it’s only a dollar, who is going to care,” and we’d quickly nip those remarks in the bud and take the process seriously. A dollar may not seem like much, but to a lot of people and our global customers, it was an increase that they felt and that was evidenced in the churn going up by 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might think, well a 7 percent increase in churn isn’t so bad, you could have raised prices even more, but that’s the wrong lesson to take away. Any changes to the plan we had in place could have yielded very different results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Extensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension program was a hit for our existing customers and a welcome option for many. Taking the time to build it resulted in over 30,000 Backblaze Personal Backup accounts buying extensions, which resulted in about $1.8M in revenue. There is a flip-side to this. If those 30,000 accounts had simply renewed at the increased price, we would have made $2.2M, resulting in $366,000 of lost revenue. But that’s only if you assume that all of those customers would have renewed. Some may have churned, and by buying an extension they signaled to us that they were willing to stay with us, even after the price increase goes into effect for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;As a customer, def happy with the way you handled this. Appreciated the opportunity to buy an extension at the old pricing, comms was clear &amp;amp; direct, and the increase is reasonable. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Being Engaged Helps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/social-media-marketing-strategy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;good foundation of community&lt;/a&gt; and an open dialog with your customers is helpful. When we made the announcement, we weren’t met with the anger that we were somewhat anticipating. In large part this was due to our customers trusting us, and knowing that this was not something we were doing because we simply wanted to make a few extra bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your community trusts you, they are willing to hear you out even when the news is not great. Build a good rapport with your customers and it will hopefully buy you the benefit of the doubt once or twice, but be careful not to abuse that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Over-Sharing Helps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to having a good community relationship, explaining the why of what is happening helps educate customers and continues to strengthen your connection with them. When I was on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/apub9v/backblaze_hiking_prices_for_first_time_on_31119/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-computer-backup-pricing-change/#disqus_thread&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;blog post comments&lt;/a&gt; discussing the price increase, the people on reddit and on our blog who have grown accustomed to our answering questions were comfortable asking some pretty hard ones, and appreciated when we would respond with thoughtful and long-form answers. I cannot stress enough how much we enjoy the conversations we have on these platforms. We learn a lot about who is using Backblaze, what their pain points are, and if there’s something we can do to help them. These conversations really do affect how we create and consider our product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; readability=&quot;10.975308641975&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;So many companies raise their prices chasing profits, keeping it on the low, so it was refreshing to get an email from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/backblaze?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@backblaze&lt;/a&gt; explaining why they have decided to increase theirs for the first time ever – transparent, decent, fair &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TDG5mknSLp&quot;&gt;https://t.co/TDG5mknSLp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/howbusinessshouldbe?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#howbusinessshouldbe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Darren (@Darren_Ware) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Darren_Ware/status/1095459924811890693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 12, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts on Raising Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rarely does anyone &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to increase their prices — especially when it affects customers who have been with them for a decade. Many companies don’t want to discuss their decision making process or playbooks, but there are a lot of organizations that face the need to raise prices. Unfortunately, there are few resources to help them thread the needle between something they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do, and something that their current and future customers will understand and accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share our journey through our price increase process in hopes that people find it both informative and interesting. Thinking about your customers first may sound like a trope, but if you spend the time to really sit back and consider their reactions and what you can do as a way to thank your existing customers or clients, you can be successful, or at the very least mitigate some of the downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever raised prices at your company, or have examples of companies that have done a great job (or a bad job), we’d love to hear those examples in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;1ebd&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l mv ne my ef nf&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;W&quot; class=&quot;ng nh ni nj nk nl ge n o gd ab&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/158/1*gjgl0CpStYLxYnGLJ1HxTg.png&quot; width=&quot;79&quot; height=&quot;79&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ef df&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;hen you buy a product like Philips Hue’s smart lights or an iPhone, you probably assume the people who wrote their code are being paid. While that’s true for those who directly author a product’s software, virtually every tech company also relies on thousands of bits of free code, made available through “open-source” projects on sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0154&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Often these developers are happy to work for free. Writing open-source software allows them to sharpen their skills, gain perspectives from the community, or simply help the industry by making innovations available at no cost. &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.google.com/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, which maintains hundreds of open-source projects, open source “enables and encourages collaboration and the development of technology, solving real-world problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9079&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;But when software used by millions of people is maintained by a community of people, or a single person, all on a volunteer basis, sometimes things can go horribly wrong. The catastrophic Heartbleed bug of 2014, which compromised the security of hundreds of millions of sites, was caused by a problem in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://it.slashdot.org/story/14/05/03/0129250/free-can-make-you-bleed-the-underresourced-open-source&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;open-source library called OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;, which relied on a single full-time developer not making a mistake as they updated and changed that code, used by millions. Other times, developers grow bored and abandon their projects, which can be breached &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;while they aren’t paying attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f315&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;It’s hard to demand that programmers who are working for free troubleshoot problems or continue to maintain software that they’ve lost interest in for whatever reason — though some companies certainly try. Not adequately maintaining these projects, on the other hand, makes the entire tech ecosystem weaker. So some open-source programmers are asking companies to pay, not for their code, but for their support services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7f35&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Daniel Stenberg&lt;/a&gt; is one of those programmers. He created cURL, one of the world’s most popular open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;76ed&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Developers use cURL to transfer information between two systems, generally in an “API” where a service needs to ask for or send data from another system. According to Stenberg, cURL is included in billions of smartphones, “several hundred million” TVs, and at least 100 million smart cars, every iPhone ever produced, and almost every other modern connected device and service you touch every day. The scale of its use is staggering considering that Stenberg does the lion’s share of the work maintaining it, with assistance from a community of volunteers. Yet few of the companies that rely on his code even realize it’s his code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bbf4&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Stenberg, who lives near Stockholm, Sweden, invented cURL in 1998 and still maintains the project for free, though he did recently take a job at a company called wolfSSL, which now pays him to work on it “as full-time as possible.” Companies that rely on a specific piece of open-source software occasionally hire those projects’ creators to build upon the projects — in this case, wolfSSL has tasked Stenberg with not only maintaining cURL but building service contracts for providing personal support of cURL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1e5a&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Stenberg never expected cURL to gain so much popularity. In fact, it took many years to learn that it was even being widely used. Because the code is available to use for free, without any commercial licensing, there’s no reason that companies need to tell him that they’re using it. He only realized the software he’d invented was becoming popular because people started telling him that they saw his name in the “about” window of software, or buried in documentation. “The temperature raised so slowly we never saw it coming,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;nm&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;d8ee&quot; class=&quot;nn no np ap jw b kn nq nr ns nt nu mt&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jw b nv nw at&quot;&gt;“I think I get annoyed when it feels like people try to take advantage of us instead of contributing their share to the project when they are getting so much out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3712&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj nx ml ny mn nz mp oa mr ob mt&quot;&gt;During the first 20 years of cURL’s existence, Stenberg says he worked on it in his spare time and earned his keep at his “real job” doing other software development. Maintaining the project took a lot of work: he’s spent thousands of hours improving cURL, fixing bugs, and improving his code. Of the 25,000 “commits,” or updates, made to the GitHub repository for cURL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/curl/curl/graphs/contributors&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Stenberg created 14,000 of them&lt;/a&gt;. No other developer contributing to the software has made more than 2,586 commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f7a8&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Survival of cURL is thanks to a set of sponsors who fund the project’s hosting and other costs — though Stenberg says no major company pitches in — and contributors like Stenberg that give their time away for free. Stenberg says he believes that it’s important that open source exists and that he has never regretted making cURL open source. What frustrates him is when companies demand his help when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;da0c&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Last year, a company overseas contacted him in a panic after they paused a firmware upgrade rollout to several million devices due to a cURL problem. “I had to explain that I couldn’t travel to them in another country on short notice to help them fix this […] because I work on cURL in my spare time and I have a full-time job,” Stenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;95dc&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Because he cares about the project, he scrambled to find a friend to help. His friend flew out and helped solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3542&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;To compensate open-source programmers for this kind of service, Stenberg believes that large companies should pay for support contracts from the developers of a library, which would compensate them for their time and help ensure a project is actually maintained for the long haul. With his work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolfssl.com/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;wolfSSL&lt;/a&gt;, he hopes to convince companies like Apple to pay up in exchange for dedicated support, but the effort is still in an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;012e&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Support contracts don’t come cheap, often ranging in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14446516&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for dedicated help for using projects and support when something goes wrong. However, the type of companies that need such a service are typically well-funded, or have broad reach, especially in the case of cURL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0bf2&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;It’s still not clear that companies would be interested in such a contract. When Stenberg asked the company that needed him to fly to a different country to troubleshoot their problem to pay for one, they refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f749&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;This frustrates him. “I think I get annoyed when it feels like people try to take advantage of us instead of contributing their share to the project when they are getting so much out of it,” he says. But he still sees support contracts as a long-term solution to maintaining open source: “Money needs to trickle down to the authors and not just get sucked up by the curators or the huge open-source projects/companies that tend to get most open-source money today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1a75&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Many in the open-source community are opposed to the idea that they should be paid in any way, which remains a controversial topic. Some in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/tim-oreilly-open-source-purists-trying-to-answer-the-wrong-question/&quot; class=&quot;ct bt jq jr js jt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the open-source community&lt;/a&gt; believe that monetization defeats the purpose of “free” — but the reality is that the people working for free need to eat and feed families, just like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;08b1&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;Today, when a developer or company emails Stenberg for help as fast as possible, he says that “my attitude has shifted more toward ‘well maybe, just maybe, this could be a case where you could consider paying for a support contract.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b4d4&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;When I ask Stenberg whether he’ll continue to maintain cURL forever — it’s already been 20 years — he says he has no plans to abandon the project that has become a major part of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b614&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;“Of course, assuming I also manage to get paid,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e9e4&quot; class=&quot;mg mh dr ap mi b mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;mi oc&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;od&quot;&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;od&quot;&gt;This article has been edited to reflect that after Stenberg, the most commits a single developer has made to cURL is 2,586.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Gitlab More Than Doubles Valuation to $2.75B Ahead of Planned 2020 IPO</title>
<link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/09/17/gitlab-doubles-valuation-to-nearly-3-billion/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2019/09/17/gitlab-doubles-valuation-to-nearly-3-billion/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d80c8216de3150009a4436d/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Sid Sijbrandij is having no difficulty finding investor suitors ahead of a 2020 IPO.&quot; data-height=&quot;737&quot; data-width=&quot;718&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Sid Sijbrandij is having no difficulty finding investor suitors ahead of a planned 2020 IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;GitLab&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;Some tech companies shy away from putting a date on going public—or even making a decision about whether they plan to list their businesses at all. At GitLab, Sid Sijbrandij already has a date set: November 18, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s symbolic meaning behind it: Two days before is the birthdate of the twin children of the CFO of GitLab, a leader in the expanding area of tech known as DevOps. But that’s a Monday. Better to go out midweek, Sijbrandij thought—and on his grandfather’s 100th birthday. “You talk about how you are going to achieve things, and internally we can say, this is where we are going,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tech “unicorn” setting such specifics is unusual. But GitLab isn’t feeling any pressure. Investors are eager to pour funds into the company, which says its annualized revenue is growing at a rate of 143% year-to-year, with net retention of customer spending at 153%. The latest: a $268 million Series E funding round that values GitLab at $2.75 billion. The round more than doubles GitLab’s valuation from its previous funding round, when it was valued at $1.1 billion, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, GitLab is backed by a consortium of investors who are eager to see its founder’s IPO plans come to fruition soon. Iconiq Capital, the lead investor in its previous raise, co-led the round with Goldman Sachs, itself a major GitLab customer. Y Combinator’s growth fund also joined, as well as a group intended to help guide the company from private to public that includes Coatue, Franklin Templeton, Tiger Global Management and Two Sigma Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing at No. 32 on the 2019 Forbes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#523a367d5f94&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Cloud 100 list&lt;/a&gt;, GitLab is unusual not just for its blunt IPO plans but also for its mostly no-office expansion (its official address in San Francisco is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mnunez/2019/09/11/a-truck-tracker-a-coder-toolbox-and-a-unicorn-from-down-under-inside-this-years-cloud-100/#1149a8b75653&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;a UPS store&lt;/a&gt;). As a leading startup in DevOps, GitLab works behind the scenes, helping customers like Delta, Nvidia and Ticketmaster ship their own software faster. With big businesses often using ten or more applications to build and release their own software, Sijbrandij opted for a platform approach that put specialists in product, development, security and operations all working together in one app. At Goldman Sachs, for example, more than 7,500 people use GitLab on a daily basis, GitLab says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d80c8a56de3150009a44370/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;With no formal office, GitLab meetings happen virtually over tools like Zoom.&quot; data-height=&quot;1271&quot; data-width=&quot;2311&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;With no formal office, GitLab meetings happen virtually over tools like Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;GitLab&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep up with it all, GitLab’s employee ranks have swelled to more than 800 in 55 countries. The funding fuels plans to hire hundreds more. And as it hires, GitLab plans to beef up its monitoring, planning and security tools in upcoming months. The company also must provide support for a growing base of more than 100,000 organizations using its tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though GitLab is reaching public-company scale, Sijbrandij still operates the business in his own unusual way. On a call ahead of the funding, he warns that we’re not alone —in addition to a public relations professional, there are two other managers on the call, one from marketing and one from product. They’re part of a shadow program in which employees spend two weeks sitting in on their CEO’s meetings, feedback sessions and media or analyst calls. Sijbrandij instituted the program six months ago while looking for a chief of staff. The program, he says, can teach employees the ins and outs of the business at “higher velocity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who back GitLab are signing up for such experiments and Sijbrandij’s unique brand of leadership. So far, there’s plenty of demand—even for GitLab publicizing its IPO target date. “Since we were clear about our ambition, that gave them extra faith that we will succeed,” Sijbrandij says.&lt;/p&gt;

We will focus this report on geography and gender, a subcategory of demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div data-first-letter=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;text-card-with-content__main-text-container&quot; data-v-0af51911=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-card-with-content__main-text text-card-with-content__main-text--no-image&quot; data-v-0af51911=&quot;&quot;&gt;We were born in a wealthy country to white, well-off parents who lived in thriving communities and were able to send us to excellent schools. These factors, among many others, put us in a great position to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-card-with-content__main-text text-card-with-content__main-text--no-image&quot; data-v-0af51911=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are billions of people on the other side of these dividing lines, however. For hundreds of millions of people around the world, hardship is all but guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting Out Ahead Title&quot; class=&quot;image-with-caption__image&quot; data-v-32222415=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting Out Ahead&quot; class=&quot;figure-with-carousel__image&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div slot=&quot;placeholder&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;gkLoader__label&quot; data-v-dadc03a0=&quot;&quot;&gt;Loading...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;figure-with-carousel__carousel&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
If you think about life as a journey, every single disadvantage makes the journey harder. Our path forward has been relatively clear of obstacles. For a girl born in the Sahel, one of the poorest regions in the world, getting to a healthy, productive life requires overcoming hurdle after hurdle after hurdle.
&lt;hr class=&quot;figure-with-carousel__divider&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;25.987012987013&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;We believe that’s wrong. Every person should have an equal opportunity to lead a healthy, productive life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;For the past 20 years, we’ve invested in health and development in low-income countries, because the worst inequality we’ve ever seen is children dying from easily preventable causes. In the United States, we’ve invested primarily in education, because a good school is a key to success, but you’re less likely to have access to one if you’re low-income, a student of color, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Goalkeepers is our annual report card on the world’s progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 17 ambitious goals the member states of the United Nations committed to reaching by 2030. As we write, &lt;a href=&quot;/goalkeepers/report/2019-report/#ExploreTheData&quot;&gt;billions of people are projected to miss the targets that we all agreed represent a decent life.&lt;/a&gt; If we hope to accelerate progress, we must address the inequality that separates the lucky from the unlucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sub-hero&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sub-hero__contents&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;(Tsiyinu, Ghana)&quot; class=&quot;mosaic-item__image mosaic-item__image--hidden&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div slot=&quot;placeholder&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;gkLoader__label&quot; data-v-dadc03a0=&quot;&quot;&gt;Loading...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title&quot;&gt;let’s take a closer look at the layers of inequality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-first-letter=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;23.933985330073&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Each time we zoom, we see yet another layer of disadvantage. These disadvantages don’t need to pile up on top of one another to make life hard—but when they do, as for the marginalized girl in Chad, the effect is brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;What is her life like? The data says she has probably been close to starving to death several times. The odds are that she never got the nutrients her &lt;a href=&quot;/goalkeepers/report/2019-report/progress-indicators/stunting/&quot;&gt;body and brain needed to develop fully.&lt;/a&gt; It is likely that she can’t read or write, and that she will get pregnant well before she turns 20, although her body won’t be ready for the rigors of childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;And when the time comes, there is a good chance &lt;a href=&quot;/goalkeepers/report/2019-report/progress-indicators/maternal-mortality/&quot;&gt;she will give birth alone.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;She deserves a better life. And we believe she can have one, as long as the world understands the many challenges she faces and gets to work on addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-WhereYouAreBorn&quot; class=&quot;section-hero&quot; data-v-649ff828=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Kal Amin kebele, Ethiopia&quot; class=&quot;mosaic-item__image&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The series of charts that follow tell you a lot about geography and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;We plotted health and education because they are the key components of what economists call &lt;span title=&quot;The World Bank’s Human Capital Index measures how much a country is losing out in future economic productivity when their children are not receiving complete education and full health.&quot;&gt;human capital&lt;/span&gt;, which we highlighted in last year’s Goalkeepers Report as “the best way for a country to unlock productivity and innovation, cut poverty, create opportunities, and generate prosperity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Investments in human capital today help people increase their incomes tomorrow. But without human capital—that is, for those who are unhealthy and uneducated—it is virtually impossible to escape poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title&quot;&gt;health and education are improving everywhere in the world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;graphicacy-graph-sticky page-report__graphicacy-graph-sticky&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;47.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress1&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;We are plotting developing countries by child mortality and years of schooling in 2000 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress2&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The first thing you can see is universal progress. Think of the most challenged country you can imagine. The people there are healthier and better educated than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Inequality between countries has narrowed but remains large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The second thing you see, however, is that in many countries, even though life is better, it is still bad. The gap between Chad and Finland is closing, but it remains enormous. More children die every single day in Chad than die in Finland in an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress3&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The third thing you see is that this pattern, big progress and big gaps, also holds true inside countries. Let's look at India and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress4&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;For the first time ever, we have human capital data at the district level. (Different countries have different names for this political subdivision. In the United States, they are counties; in India, districts; and in Nigeria, local government areas, or LGAs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress5&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Human capital has increased in more than 99 percent of districts in developing countries in the past 17 years. No matter how many times you hear the opposite, life is getting better, even for the very poorest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;However, the inequality between districts in countries is massive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress6&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Consider India. In Kollam district in Kerala state, 1 percent of young children die, and the average person has more than 14 years of education, almost comparable to the most developed countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress7&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;By comparison, in Budaun district in Uttar Pradesh state, more than 8 percent of children die, and the average person has approximately six years of education. Budaun, by the way, is not small. Approximately 4 million people live there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress8&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;In Nigeria, the data says the same thing: world-class achievement juxtaposed to serious deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress9&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;For example, the average person in Ado-Ekiti, in Ekiti state, has more than 12 years of education, whereas the average person in Garki, in Jigawa state, has five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress10&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Let's go back to the country level dots for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress11&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;When we model these charts into the future, you see that many countries are not catching up fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-ChildMortalityandEducationProgress12&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block graphicacy-graph-sticky__copy-item chapter-copy-block--vertical&quot; data-v-1c42613c=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Very few developing countries are projected to meet the health and education SDGs. Nearly two thirds of the children in low- and low-middle income countries live in districts that, at their current rate of progress, won’t reach the SDG target for child mortality by 2030. One third live in districts that won’t even reach it by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;If we are serious about the SDGs, then we have to accelerate the fight against geographical inequality and make sure that more districts are excelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-InequalityStacksTheDeck&quot; class=&quot;section-hero&quot; data-v-649ff828=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;(Tamale, Ghana)&quot; class=&quot;mosaic-item__image&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div data-first-letter=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Gender inequality cuts across every single country on Earth. No matter where you are born, your life will be harder if you are born a girl. If you are born in a poor country or district, it will be even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Adolescence is when girls’ and boys’ futures really start to diverge. Boys’ worlds expand. They rely less on their parents, venture farther and farther from home, and enroll in high school or college or get a job, which puts them in contact with wider society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;At the same time, girls’ worlds contract. They transition, sometimes at a very young age, from being subservient to their parents to being subservient to their husbands. Although they enjoyed some measure of freedom while attending primary school, they are expected to return to the confines of the home, to devote themselves to cooking, cleaning, and raising children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;image alternative text&quot; class=&quot;figure-with-carousel__image&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div slot=&quot;placeholder&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;gkLoader__label&quot; data-v-dadc03a0=&quot;&quot;&gt;Loading...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;figure-with-carousel__carousel&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;23.957537154989&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The proportion of girls who do at least two hours per day of unpaid domestic work almost doubles after they reach the age of 15; by the time she is an adult, &lt;a href=&quot;/goalkeepers/report/2019-report/progress-indicators/gender-equality/&quot;&gt;the average woman spends more than four hours every day doing unpaid work.&lt;/a&gt; Men, by comparison, average just over one hour per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;These obligations inside the home are just one example of social norms that conspire to limit girls’ opportunities as they approach adulthood. Across sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, girls average two fewer years of education than boys. And even when girls are well educated, they are much less likely to translate their years of schooling into a job in the formal work force. Globally, there is a 24 percentage-point gap between men’s and women’s labor force participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;This lack of access to education and jobs is destructive for everyone. It keeps women disempowered, limits their children’s life chances, and slows down economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title chapter-copy-block__title--image&quot;&gt;education is necessary but not sufficient to close the gender gap in economic opportunity.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Botswana has three times more women in the formal work force than Ghana, despite both countries averaging approximately eight years of education among females. One reason why is more progressive gender-related laws and policies in Botswana &lt;img alt=&quot;Gender Data Chart&quot; class=&quot;image-with-caption__image&quot; data-v-32222415=&quot;&quot;/&gt;  The first thing this chart tells you is that, on average, girls are more likely to get better jobs the longer they stay in school. However, you also see that in some countries, girls tend to be well-educated yet under-represented in the workforce. In other words, until you address discriminatory norms and policies, women won’t have equal access to high-quality job opportunities.
&lt;hr class=&quot;image-with-caption__divider&quot; data-v-32222415=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;ExaminingInequality-LearningFromExemplars&quot; class=&quot;section-hero&quot; data-v-649ff828=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;(Sondari Pakartoli Village, India)&quot; class=&quot;mosaic-item__image&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div data-first-letter=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The large and lingering gaps between countries, between districts, and between boys and girls prove that although the world’s investments in development are working, the lives of the lucky and unlucky aren’t converging fast enough. We believe the development community needs to start doing business differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;In last year’s Goalkeepers Report, we argued that human capital is critical to economic growth in poor countries. This year, we argue that human capital investments should be designed to reach girls and prioritize those countries and districts that have to make up the most ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;That’s not an easy thing to do. Inequality, as we have said, is exceedingly complex. There is no silver bullet that will make geography, gender, and other random factors stop mattering. But guaranteeing that every single child has access to good health and education systems is a very good start in that direction. This is not just a moral aspiration; we believe it to be an achievable goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;In the case of education, not that long ago, conventional wisdom held that poor children didn’t really need to be educated. That idea has been discredited in every region in the world in the past 50 years, and most countries in the world are approaching universal primary school enrollment. The priority now is to make sure that all schools provide a &lt;a href=&quot;/goalkeepers/report/2019-report/progress-indicators/education/&quot;&gt;high-quality education&lt;/a&gt;. There are proven approaches to teaching literacy and numeracy in a single classroom, but there is not yet consensus about what it will take to improve basic skills at the massive scale of every single child in every single school in every single country. Last year, this report highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;/goalkeepers/report/2018-report/case-studies/quiet-hope/&quot;&gt;promising innovations being tried&lt;/a&gt; in Côte d’Ivoire, India, and Zambia, as well as Vietnam’s nationwide success. All the human capital in the world, though, won’t lead to equality and prosperity if healthy, well-educated girls are subject to social norms that disempower them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Harmful norms can be hard even to see, much less change, but countries are taking steps to help women confront them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;A big part of the solution is policies that help women and girls carve out new paths for themselves. For example, in places like Peru, where women have the right to own land and other assets and have ready access to contraceptives so they can plan their families, women’s labor force participation goes up. Later in the report, &lt;a href=&quot;/goalkeepers/report/2019-report/#DigitalInclusion&quot;&gt;Arshi Aadil&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on digital financial inclusion, writes about policy reforms in India that are not only improving government services for the poor but also chipping away at the foundations of male supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-hero__copy&quot;&gt;When we started our foundation, we focused on discovering and developing new tools and technologies. We quickly learned that we also needed to focus on delivering them to the people who need them. Primary health care is by far the most important health delivery system in the world. A strong primary health system reaches everybody, including the poorest and most vulnerable, and provides the vast majority of services a person needs to stay healthy. We know that, as governments invest more in primary health care systems, overall health outcomes improve, but unfortunately, low- and middle-income countries spend an average of just 36 percent of their health budgets on primary care. Some governments prioritize advanced health care for a minority of citizens, forcing the majority of citizens to pay out of pocket to meet their basic needs. This inequality feeds the vicious cycle of poverty and sickness. More—and more efficient—investment in primary care can help break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;region-card__phrase&quot; data-v-adf35e30=&quot;&quot;&gt;I spend a lot of my time trying to reconcile a big idea and a small number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author-card__author region-card__author-card&quot; data-v-07247bdd=&quot;&quot; data-v-adf35e30=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image alternative text&quot; class=&quot;author-card__author-photo&quot; data-v-07247bdd=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The big idea is that health should not be a luxury—that all people should receive the care they need without suffering financial hardship. This is called Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2012 calling on member states to prioritize UHC, and the idea has been gaining momentum ever since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;The small number is 51. That’s my own personal back-of-the-envelope calculation of how many dollars the average sub-Saharan African country would have available to spend on health care per person under ideal circumstances. (My definition of “ideal circumstances” is a country collecting 20 percent of its GDP in taxes and spending 15 percent of its budget on health; the reality in most African countries is far from ideal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;To be clear, I am not saying most countries currently spend $51 per person (they don’t) or that, if they did, it would be enough (it wouldn’t). I am merely demonstrating that compared to richer countries that can spend thousands of dollars per capita on health, sub-Saharan African countries have to figure out how to get by with very little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;figure-with-carousel__carousel&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;60&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;So, how do countries buy UHC when they have less than $51 to spend? The answer is: by investing in primary health care—that is, basic services near where people live and work. A good primary health system is just and equitable, is easily accessible to everybody, doesn’t make the poor pay anything out of pocket, and addresses the vast majority of people’s lifetime health needs. Its goal is to keep people healthy, because sickness is expensive for the individual, the family, the community, and the state!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;When I think about primary health care, I remember walking hand in hand with my mum to our local dispensary in rural Kenya, which was about one kilometer away. That’s where I got vaccinated. It’s where my mum got prenatal care when she was pregnant with our last-born sister. And it’s where everybody we knew went when they were sick and seeking advice or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Since the turn of the millennium, several African countries have invested in building far-reaching, high-quality primary health systems. Ethiopia and Rwanda, for example, have recruited tens of thousands of community health workers, women who are chosen by their neighbors and trained by the government to take care of people’s health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Community health workers go to the people, instead of the other way around. And they don’t interact with people only when they are sick. They also promote healthy behavior (like proper diet and hygiene) and provide or promote preventive care (like immunizations) to keep people from getting sick in the first place. And then, of course, they are trained to treat common illnesses (like diarrhea and malaria), provide basic family planning services, and refer patients to health facilities if they need more sophisticated care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;As a result of these investments, Ethiopia and Rwanda are among the leaders in the region in reducing maternal and child mortality. And by the way, the GDP per capita in both countries is well below the regional average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Many other African countries have yet to make the necessary investments. My own country, Kenya, is much richer than Ethiopia and Rwanda, but the primary care system is weaker (though there is finally high-level political commitment to strengthening it). What matters are the choices that politicians make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title&quot;&gt;here are three choices they can make to achieve better health results with limited budgets:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;PrimaryHealthcare&quot; data-section-type=&quot;subsection&quot; data-subsection-parent=&quot;StoriesOfProgress&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title&quot;&gt;spend a little more&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;In 2001, all 54 member states of the African Union committed to spend 15 percent of their state budgets on health. A precious few have ever met that commitment, and those who meet it year after year can be counted on one hand. Governments must balance countless priorities, so finding more money for health is not easy. But when you are making do with such small budgets, every extra dollar counts. Kenya currently spends $36 per person per year, or 7 percent of its budget, on health. If that went up to, say, $51, the universe of the possible would expand significantly. At $86, according to an analysis based on WHO data, governments of low-income countries could fully fund primary health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title&quot;&gt;spend on right priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Many countries spend more on what is known as secondary and tertiary care than on primary care. That makes sense in one respect, because MRIs, X-rays, and many other features of secondary and tertiary care are expensive. But African governments can’t afford to spend most of their money to meet some of some people’s needs. In Thailand, which has one of the best primary care systems in the world, the government temporarily reallocated all its health infrastructure spending to rural areas because the health gap between rural and urban areas was so big. Now there is at least one health center in every single Thai village. African governments need to say, “Until we are sure primary health care has the investment it needs, we’ll make do with what we have for secondary and tertiary care.” It’s a difficult position to take, but it’s what countries that care about UHC have to do when there is so little money available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;46&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title&quot;&gt;spend more efficiently&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Primary care systems can do a lot to stretch the dollars they spend. For example, they can invest in digital health, especially electronic medical records. Or they can focus on managerial innovation, like new ways for a continent with many countries and a large geographical area to pool purchasing and improve supply chains. This would ensure that the right products are available at the right prices and delivered to the right places at the right times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Finally, it is crucial to use data to answer two key questions about UHC: What and who?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;When you know you can’t provide every service, choices about what to provide make a big difference. For African countries, I boldly prescribe prioritizing sexual and reproductive health and rights. But you still have to decide where to put your resources, based not on generic global calculations but on actual conditions on the ground. For example, vasectomies may look cost-effective on paper, and they are good and encouraged, but the return will be less in a country where few providers can perform them, men are resistant, or the biggest challenge is a burgeoning adolescent population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Next, the who. To make sure no one suffers financial hardship, you need to subsidize the most marginalized and vulnerable, including women, children, and girls, as well as the indigent. However, in countries where most people work in the informal economy and data is unreliable, it’s hard to know precisely who the indigent are. Kenya, with 80 percent of its population employed informally, is working on developing rigorous methodologies to target services more effectively. Ideally, as primary health systems begin to get the same results for less money, they’ll invest what’s left over in getting even better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sub-hero page-report__sub-hero&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;30.626617375231&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sub-hero__contents&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;41.807763401109&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;(Iloodariak Dispensary, Kiserian, Kenya)&quot; class=&quot;mosaic-item__image mosaic-item__image--hidden&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div slot=&quot;placeholder&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-hero__copy&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I was seven, the World Health Assembly announced its commitment to “health for all.” The tragedy is that when it turned out to be hard to pay for, the world stopped thinking about it, even as a moral principle. Today I am 49, and we finally believe in health for all again. With the global dialogue about UHC, we are also thinking practically about how to achieve it. In other words, we have a second chance. Now leaders in Africa and around the world have to take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-hero__copy&quot;&gt;Some pessimists warn that technology will usher in a dystopian future. Some naïve optimists predict it will create a utopia. The truth lies somewhere in between. Technology is disruptive, and countries need to invest to maximize the positive disruptions and manage the negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Few countries have been as innovative and thoughtful about using digital technology to make people’s lives better as India. The government understood early on that technology made it possible to connect directly with citizens instead of working through layers and layers of bureaucracy. Then it started creating smart policies built around digital technology that improved both the quality and reach of government services. This essay, which describes the reform of cooking gas subsidies, demonstrates how aligning technology and policy can create a surprising domino effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-first-letter=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;But it’s about cooking gas only in the narrowest sense. In a wider sense, it’s about how digital technology helped the government of India design a series of innovative policies that have empowered 75 million marginalized women. In the very widest sense, it’s about how governments can serve citizens better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;For decades, Indian households bought the liquid petroleum gas they cooked with at a fixed, low price guaranteed by the government. This subsidy was poorly targeted, because everybody, including the rich, could receive it. (According to the IMF, the wealthiest 10 percent of Indian households received seven times more of the subsidy than the poorest 10 percent.) It was inefficient, because a lot of subsidized gas was sold in the black market to hotels, restaurants, and other businesses that should have paid market price. Finally, it was expensive; various gas subsidies could cost the government almost $10 billion per year, depending on the global price of gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Now comes the turning point of this story: India’s pioneering of what is known as “the JAM trinity.” The J stands for Jan Dhan Yojana, an Indian government program to help poor people open bank accounts. The A stands for Aadhaar, a program to provide every Indian resident with a unique ID linked to biometric authentication like fingerprints. And the M stands for mobile phones, which are quickly becoming ubiquitous in India. Together, accounts, ID, and phones make it possible for the government to deposit money directly into people’s bank accounts and verify the recipients’ identity. This in turn enables the government to be much more precise and ambitious about policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__title chapter-copy-block__title--image&quot;&gt;The JAM Trinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;JAM Trinity&quot; class=&quot;image-with-caption__image&quot; data-v-32222415=&quot;&quot;/&gt;  In an analog world, government benefits reached poor people through an inefficient network of intermediaries. In a digital world powered by the JAM trinity, the government can reach people directly—and people can reach back.
&lt;hr class=&quot;image-with-caption__divider&quot; data-v-32222415=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Starting in 2012 and continuing through 2015, the government used the JAM trinity to shift gradually from subsidizing the price of gas to transferring cash directly into people’s bank accounts after they had bought the gas at market price. The fully redesigned subsidy, launched nationwide under the name PAHAL in 2015, is the world’s largest cash transfer program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;PAHAL has addressed all three major problems with the old subsidy. Using Aadhaar, the government was able to remove 36 million duplicate or ghost recipients from the rolls, decreasing diversion to the black market and increasing overall efficiency. After a government campaign encouraging better-off people to stop claiming the subsidy, another 10 million Indians removed themselves from the rolls, improving targeting. As a result, PAHAL reduced the financial burden on the government: Although estimates vary, the government puts the savings at almost $9 billion since the PAHAL launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;But the government hasn’t just pocketed the savings. It’s used them to create a brand new, third-generation cooking gas program, also powered by the JAM trinity, called Ujjwala. This program has been carefully designed to help poor women transform their lives in profound ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;JAM Generations&quot; class=&quot;figure-with-carousel__image&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div slot=&quot;placeholder&quot; data-v-7deeae9e=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Most poor families, especially in rural areas, don’t cook with gas; even if it’s subsidized, it’s still more expensive than building fires with wood or animal dung. However, wood and dung fires fill kitchens with hazardous smoke (household air pollution is responsible for nearly 500,000 deaths per year in India). To address this crisis, Ujjwala provides qualifying rural households with a 50 percent subsidy to purchase a gas connection and stove. (The other 50 percent can be paid in installments.) So far, approximately 75 million women have benefitted from Ujjwala. The government is now considering additional reforms to encourage Ujjwala recipients to refill their gas canisters, which are not necessarily affordable enough or easy enough to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-hero__copy&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot;&gt;But Ujjwala’s impact doesn’t stop at health. The program is also helping women chip away at discriminatory social norms that have limited their horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;61.650638617581&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;For example, the average Indian woman spends more than 40 hours per week doing domestic work, leaving precious little time for anything else. Using cooking gas saves women several hours per day they had been spending gathering firewood, building and managing fires that made them sick, and then cleaning up the ashes and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Moreover, the government made an important decision about how the benefits would be disbursed that is disrupting traditional power dynamics in the home. Unlike with traditional benefits programs in India, it is women—and not their husbands— who are eligible for Ujjwala. To receive the gas subsidy, women need to sign up for a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Merely having and using a bank account changes women’s lives, by giving them decision-making power over the family’s finances. A randomized control trial of a different Indian social benefit program, a work guarantee program, found that when women received payments directly into their own accounts (instead of accounts in their husband’s names) and received training on how to use the accounts, they worked more and earned more. Their husbands also said they were more comfortable with their wives working outside the home. In other words, helping women gain control over financial resources ends up changing everyone’s sense of who they are and what they are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;There is yet another way that policies designed around the JAM trinity are empowering the poor—by making government more accountable. For example, with the new cooking gas subsidy, government officials in 640 Indian districts receive daily progress reports on PAHAL, including enrollment, cash transfer, and error rates, so they can identify and address problems as soon as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Various states are also experimenting with ways to proactively solicit citizens’ input whenever they interact with government. In one state, for example, beneficiaries receive an automated call soliciting feedback on the quality of the service: Was the customer treated courteously? Did she receive the benefits she expected? Did she receive them without having to pay a bribe? Negative responses roll over into a human system to generate formal complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;On its own, the JAM trinity doesn’t do much. It needs to be paired with smart, pro-poor policies and services built around digital technology. Even then, digitally powered policies and services by themselves won’t end poverty and gender inequality. They need to be accompanied by analog reforms like changing discriminatory laws and policies. When all these pieces come together, though, the status quo can change fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-hero__copy&quot;&gt;The global climate change debate is mostly focused on how to limit carbon emissions. We are still waiting for the big technology and policy breakthroughs we need. Meanwhile, the climate is already changing. It is a terrible injustice that the people who suffer the most are the poorest farmers in the world. They didn’t do anything to cause climate change, but because they rely on rain for their livelihoods, they are at the front lines of coping with it. These farmers already have no margin for error. They don’t have the resources to adapt to droughts and floods, disease outbreaks among their herds, or new pests devouring their harvest. In Ethiopia, the government and millions of farmers have embarked on an impressive crash course in building resilience, and it is working. As State Minister Kaba writes, the 2015 drought didn’t cause anywhere near the death or destruction of the infamous 1984 drought. Ethiopia’s success offers hope. Worldwide, we need greater investment in developing and distributing improved crop varieties that tolerate stresses like extreme heat or floods. The world’s agricultural research system needs more support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bill and Melinda Gates Signature&quot; class=&quot;image-with-caption__image&quot; data-v-32222415=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ClimateAdaptation-The1984Famine&quot; class=&quot;region-card&quot; data-v-adf35e30=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Region: Africa, Country: Ethiopia&quot; class=&quot;region-card__image&quot; data-v-adf35e30=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-v-adf35e30=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;region-card__phrase&quot; data-v-adf35e30=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 1984 famine is a dark history that we have gone through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author-card__author region-card__author-card&quot; data-v-07247bdd=&quot;&quot; data-v-adf35e30=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Dr. Kaba Urgessa&quot; class=&quot;author-card__author-photo&quot; data-v-07247bdd=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-first-letter=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;But sometimes—although it feels strange to say— there’s opportunity in crisis. Shortly after the famine, we established a disaster management policy and built up food reserves so that when droughts happened, we could at least save the lives of our people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;As the years passed, we invested heavily in the productivity and resilience of our agriculture sector. We had to, because more than 80 percent of our people live in rural areas. In 2003, the African Union met in Maputo, Mozambique, and governments committed to spend 10 percent of their budgets on agriculture; we spend more than that. In 2015, we suffered a drought just as severe as the one that led to the 1984 famine, but the world never heard about it because we had built better systems to help farmers cope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Our thriving agriculture sector is part of why Ethiopia’s overall economic growth has been so impressive, and why we are on track to become a middle-income country by 2025. But there is one thing that could derail us: climate change. Climate change is caused by the actions of richer countries, but the most vulnerable people in poorer countries are feeling it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sub-hero__copy&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since I was a boy, the temperature here has increased by about 1 degree Celsius. But the rain is a much bigger problem. Overall, there is less of it—20 percent less in some places. What rain is left is less predictable. It comes late and leaves early. When it does come, it can come in destructive torrents. Every calculation a farmer makes is based on weather. Smallholder farmers are very good agronomists, but they have spent their lives learning things about a climate that is ceasing to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Fortunately, the work we’ve been doing for the past 20 years will help our farmers respond to the changing climate in the next 20. In 2005, we launched a very large program that pays people to work on agriculture-related public works projects. The impact is twofold: The poor have the means to purchase food and other necessities when emergencies strike, and they build community assets like bench terraces, bunds, check dams, deep trenches, and microbasins that conserve water, prevent soil erosion, and ultimately contribute to higher yields. Three years later, we launched another program to foster a mass movement around sustainable land management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;We have also hired one of the largest cadres of agricultural extension agents in the world. They are a source of timely information; for example, they provide early warnings about droughts and advice about how farmers might adjust. They also focus on longer-term education. Our network of extension agents is one reason why Ethiopian farmers are more likely to use fertilizer, improved seeds, or irrigation than farmers in many neighboring countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;We have no illusions about what we are up against. Several years ago, we launched our Climate Resilient Green Economy strategy, which recognizes that our future prosperity is riding on proper stewardship of our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;We cannot stop the droughts. We can flourish in spite of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Twenty years ago, when I started farming this land, the weather was better. But it keeps getting hotter. July should be a cold month; this year it’s much hotter than usual. And the rains are not dependable. One year there are good rains, and the next year there's drought. It usually begins raining in late May or early June. This year, it’s already late July and it hasn’t rained yet. We’re still waiting. We try to sow at the best times, but we can’t control the rain. If it doesn’t start raining until July and stops before October, we won’t get anything from our fields. If things get bad, I have some sheep I can sell or trade. I am thinking about investing in beehives for honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Even though the weather is worse, our farming is much better now. When I was growing up on my parents’ farm, the land was destroyed. They didn’t get any kind of help from the government. When the famine came in 1984, moving the family to Sudan was the only option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;Now, we get information and education from agricultural experts who come to our community. Before, we didn’t use modern seeds. Now I use the best wheat seeds. I plant wheat that’s ready to harvest earlier, so it does better in a drought. Before, we didn’t use fertilizer, herbicides, or pesticides. Now I can use all three. I know about weeding. I know how to protect my field from drying out in the sun. My yields have almost doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;ClimateAdaptation-WeatherInOurArea&quot; class=&quot;sub-hero page-report__sub-hero&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sub-hero__contents&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;(Kal Amin kebele, Ethiopia)&quot; class=&quot;mosaic-item__image&quot; data-v-a2944f28=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;sub-hero__subheadline&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot;&gt;conditions here and overcome.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sub-hero__copy&quot; data-v-6064c636=&quot;&quot;&gt;This year, we were told that the rains would be less, and we received training about what to do. We harvest rainwater by collecting the runoff and storing it for later. With all our strength and ability, we try to keep the ground moist. We do that in many different ways: applying mulch, digging trenches, plowing, mending gullies. When a little rain starts to fall, every household works hard to make sure it stays in the soil. No one sits in the house if there is rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div lazyloaded=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;chapter-copy-block&quot; readability=&quot;12.646739130435&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chapter-copy-block__copy&quot;&gt;We try to adapt to the conditions here and overcome. I want my children to get an education. I didn’t get one when I was a child; I didn’t go to school a day in my life. But all three of my children are enrolled. I must make sure that they are fed. If I grow wheat early this year, I will switch to barley during the next growing season because I want barley for my kids to eat. My children can’t learn and study with empty bellies. Every decision I make is about what my family needs.&lt;/p&gt;
