<title>A Julia Interpreter and Debugger</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://julialang.org/blog/2019/03/debuggers</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;19 Mar 2019&lt;/span&gt;  |  &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy&quot;&gt;Tim Holy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KristofferC&quot;&gt;Kristoffer Carlsson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pfitzseb&quot;&gt;Sebastian Pfitzner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Keno&quot;&gt;Keno Fischer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are pleased to announce the release of a fully-featured debugger for Julia. You can now easily debug and introspect Julia code in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.9792207792208&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step into functions and manually walk through your code while inspecting its state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set breakpoints and trap errors, allowing you to discover what went wrong at the point of trouble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactively update and replace existing code to rapidly fix bugs in place without restarting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the full-featured IDE in &lt;a href=&quot;http://junolab.org/&quot; title=&quot;Juno&quot;&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt; to bundle all these features together in an easy to use graphical interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debugger is itself a collection of tools that enable those features. The core is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl&quot; title=&quot;JuliaInterpreter&quot;&gt;an interpreter&lt;/a&gt; that can faithfully run Julia code while allowing various front-ends to control its execution. Each front-end is its own package: &lt;a href=&quot;http://junolab.org/&quot; title=&quot;Juno&quot;&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt; incorporates the debugger into its IDE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/Rebugger.jl&quot; title=&quot;Rebugger&quot;&gt;Rebugger&lt;/a&gt; provides a REPL text UI, and the traditional step/next/continue command-line interface is provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Debugger.jl&quot; title=&quot;Debugger&quot;&gt;Debugger&lt;/a&gt;. All these new debugging capabilities seamlessly integrate with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl&quot; title=&quot;Revise&quot;&gt;Revise&lt;/a&gt;, so that you can continuously analyze and modify code in a single session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To orient potential users to the debugger front-ends, here we include a couple of screen shots that highlight the new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;juno&quot;&gt;Juno&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juno provides a rich user interface around the interpreter and allows you to set breakpoints and step through directly in the source code. The debugger REPL can execute arbitrary code in a local context and the Workspace allows you to inspect local variables. The screenshot below shows a small debugging session for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://julialang.org/images/blog/2019-03-19-debuggers/juno.png&quot; alt=&quot;Juno&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Juno.@run&lt;/code&gt; macro interprets your code and drops you in a debugging session if it hits a breakpoint, while &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Juno.@enter&lt;/code&gt; allows you to step through starting from the first line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;debugger-and-rebugger&quot;&gt;Debugger and Rebugger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different favorite editor than Atom—or sometimes work in remote sessions through a console interface—you can alternatively perform debugging via the REPL. There are two REPL interfaces: Debugger offers a “step, next, continue” interface similar to debuggers like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;, whereas Rebugger aims to provide a console interface that is reminiscent of an IDE. Debugger has some capabilities that none of the other interfaces offer (e.g., very fine-grained control over stepping, the ability to execute the generator of generated functions, etc.), so it should be your go-to choice for particularly difficult cases. Below is a screenshot of a short session using Debugger.jl, showing some of its features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://julialang.org/images/blog/2019-03-19-debuggers/debugger_jl_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Debugger.jl&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the screenshot, the function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;closestpair&lt;/code&gt; is debugged by prepending the call with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@enter&lt;/code&gt; macro. Execution is then suspended on the first line of the function (line 4) and it is possible to see a breakpoint on line 8. Upon running the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (short for “continue”), execution is resumed until a breakpoint is encountered. At this point, the command &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fr&lt;/code&gt; (short for “frame”) shows all the local variables and their values at the point where the execution of the code suspended due to the breakpoint. Finally, a “Julia REPL mode” is entered using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;`&lt;/code&gt; key. This gives a normal Julia REPL mode with the addition that the local variables are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebugger enters calls via a key binding. To try it, type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcd(10, 20)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;em&gt;without hitting enter&lt;/em&gt; type Meta-i (Esc-i, Alt-i, or option-i). After a short pause the display should update; type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; to see the possible actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://julialang.org/images/blog/2019-03-19-debuggers/rebugger_interpret.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rebugger&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebugger also features an “edit” interface. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://timholy.github.io/Rebugger.jl/dev/&quot;&gt;Rebugger’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With several packages making their initial debut, and some old ones getting new capabilities, we felt it would be appropriate to provide an overview of the underpinnings of the new ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;juliainterpreter&quot;&gt;JuliaInterpreter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl&quot; title=&quot;JuliaInterpreter&quot;&gt;JuliaInterpreter&lt;/a&gt; is the lynch pin of the entire stack; it contains the logic needed to evaluate and inspect running Julia code. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)&quot;&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt; lends itself naturally to step-wise code evaluation and the implementation of breakpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter descended from an original package &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/ASTInterpreter2.jl&quot;&gt;ASTInterpreter2&lt;/a&gt; written by Keno Fischer. In its original form (prior to Jan 2019), ASTInterpreter2 was a fairly small but sophisticated package, capable of handling many advanced aspects of Julia’s internal representation of code. It was in need of updating to the many changes in Julia 1.0, although most of that work had already been done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Roboneet&quot;&gt;Neethu Joy&lt;/a&gt; in late 2018. When we began our own efforts, we finished the updates and decided to extend it in many ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;36.196786016352&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter became recursive-by-default, interpreting calls all the way down to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ccall&lt;/code&gt;s, intrinsic functions, and builtin functions that define Julia’s lowest levels. By running virtually all code through the interpreter, it became more straightforward to implement breakpoints and trap errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14.389623601221&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter received numerous performance enhancements, and now can run step-wise through code at roughly 50× its original speed. These optimizations reduce—but come nowhere close to eliminating—the most serious disadvantage of running all code in the interpreter: slow performance. It is hoped that the performance gap between compiled and interpreted code, which can be many orders of magnitude, will narrow in the coming months. However, the interpreter will always be slower than compiled code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that there are cases where the interpreter feels faster, at least on initial execution. Julia’s JIT compiler produces excellent results, but all that code-analysis takes time; there is interest in exploring whether running more code in the interpreter could reduce latency, a.k.a. the “time to first plot” problem. JuliaInterpreter is a potential tool for exploring that trade off, and it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl/issues/44&quot;&gt;not much additional work would be needed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;35.156428119063&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter gained the ability to interpret “top-level code”, for example the code used to define packages and create test suites. This was a major change, partly because top-level code uses an expanded vocabulary, but mostly because top-level code can define new modules, structures, and methods, which in turn introduces the need to manage “world age,” the counter that determines the visibility of methods to callers. (If this fails, you see errors like “method is too new to be called…”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporting top-level code allowed JuliaInterpreter to achieve two goals: the ability to serve as the foundation of new code-parsing abilities for Revise, and the ability to run test suites originally designed for compiled Julia code. Once we had top-level execution partially working, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/JuliaInterpreter.jl/issues/13&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate JuliaInterpreter against the most extensive single test suite available, that of Julia itself. This revealed dozens of bugs in areas like the calling of C libraries (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ccall&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@cfunction&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cglobal&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;llvmcall&lt;/code&gt;, keyword-argument functions, generated functions, anonymous functions, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; definitions, global variables, the handling of try/catch, locks and threads, and the treatment of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@eval&lt;/code&gt;ed code. Some of these problems were isolated for us from the test suite failures by two additional contributors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GunnarFarneback&quot;&gt;Gunnar Farnebäck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/macd&quot;&gt;Don MacMillen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, most of the cleanly-isolated problems have been fixed. While we are still far from perfect, the pursuit of such a demanding goal has contributed extensively to the robustness of these young packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JuliaInterpreter gained support for breakpoints. While not strictly a feature of interpreters, they are necessary to build a capable debugger and can be viewed as an additional form of control-flow within the interpreter itself. These breakpoints can be set manually with functions &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;breakpoint&lt;/code&gt; and a macro &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@breakpoint&lt;/code&gt;, manipulated in Juno, Rebugger, or Debugger, or added directly to code with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@bp&lt;/code&gt; macro. Existing breakpoints can be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;disable&lt;/code&gt;d, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/code&gt;d, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt;d. We support setting of breakpoints at specific source lines or on entry to a specific method, conditional and unconditional breakpoints, and can automatically trap errors as if they were manually-set breakpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the interpreter in its own right, you can start like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;using JuliaInterpreter
A = rand(1:10, 5)
@interpret sum(A)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all is working well, you should see the same answer you get from running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sum(A)&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@interpret&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;loweredcodeutils&quot;&gt;LoweredCodeUtils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JuliaDebug/LoweredCodeUtils.jl&quot; title=&quot;LoweredCodeUtils&quot;&gt;LoweredCodeUtils&lt;/a&gt; is the most specialized and opaque of the new packages. Its purpose is to build links between multiple cooperating methods. For example, the seemingly-simple definition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mymethod(x, y=0; z=&quot;Hello&quot;, msg=&quot;world&quot;) = 1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;actually creates 5 methods: one “body method” (here, simply returning &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;), two “positional-argument” methods (ones that do not accept any keyword arguments), and two “keyword function” methods (ones that get called when you supply at least one keyword argument, then fill in defaults and standardize order). Because all five of these arise from the same user-supplied expression, they need to be implicitly linked in order to provide a satisfying user experience. In particular, changes to source files cause the line numbers of compiled methods to become outdated; if we didn’t correct that, Juno might open a file to the outdated line number when stepping through code. LoweredCodeUtils does the source-level analysis to discover these associations and handle differences that arise when parsing the same file multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever wanted to be able to parse Julia code and extract the signatures of the methods it defines (without redefining the methods), LoweredCodeUtils is the package for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;codetracking&quot;&gt;CodeTracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/CodeTracking.jl&quot; title=&quot;CodeTracking&quot;&gt;CodeTracking&lt;/a&gt; was designed to act as a simple, lightweight “query API” for retrieving data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl&quot; title=&quot;Revise&quot;&gt;Revise&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, LoweredCodeUtils performs analysis, Revise manages changes that occur over time, and CodeTracking informs the rest of the world. For CodeTracking to do anything interesting, you need to be running Revise; to allow CodeTracking to be a lightweight dependency, it relies on Revise to populate its own internal variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/timholy/CodeTracking.jl&quot; title=&quot;CodeTracking&quot;&gt;CodeTracking’s README&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;revise-and-rebugger&quot;&gt;Revise and Rebugger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a rewrite based on JuliaInterpreter, Revise and Rebugger are better (in some cases, much better) at their core tasks. In particular, if you used an earlier version of Rebugger, you may have noticed that it was defeated by many language constructs (e.g., functions containing keyword arguments, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@eval&lt;/code&gt;-generated methods, etc). Most of the underlying causes were resolved by LoweredCodeUtils, which is in turn used by Revise, which then feeds the necessary data to CodeTracking for consumption by Rebugger. As one measure of the difference, of the more than 10,000 methods in Base, Revise 1.1.0 fails to capture 1,425 method signatures (a failure rate of 13%). In contrast, Revise 2.0.0 misses only 10 (&amp;lt;0.1%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, in addition to the new “interpret” interface, the new Rebugger is much better at its original “edit” interface, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revise (and consequently Rebugger) has also gained some other new abilities, like handling methods defined at the REPL. In the longer term, the deep analysis of code permitted by JuliaInterpreter and LoweredCodeUtils may support features that were formerly out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been only a high-level overview. Some of the individual packages have extensive documentation, and interested readers are encouraged to work through it. For anyone looking to develop a deeper understanding of the internals of Julia’s code, the new packages provide a powerful set of tools for introspection and analysis. And of course, we hope that the new debugging capabilities further accelerate Julia’s rapid development, and make it that much more fun of a language to use.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tesla sues former employees for allegedly stealing data, Autopilot source code</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-lawsuit/tesla-sues-former-employees-for-allegedly-stealing-data-autopilot-source-code-idUSKCN1R21P9</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-lawsuit/tesla-sues-former-employees-for-allegedly-stealing-data-autopilot-source-code-idUSKCN1R21P9</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Tesla Inc filed a lawsuit on Thursday against a former engineer at the company, claiming he copied the source code for its Autopilot technology before joining a Chinese self-driving car startup in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineer, Guangzhi Cao, copied more than 300,000 files related to Autopilot source code as he prepared to join China’s Xiaopeng Motors Technology Company Ltd, the Silicon Valley carmaker said in the lawsuit filed in a California court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Tesla lawyers on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against four former employees and U.S. self-driving car startup Zoox Inc, alleging the employees stole proprietary information and trade secrets for developing warehousing, logistics and inventory control operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Xiaopeng spokeswoman Marie Cheung said the company was not aware of Cao’s alleged misconduct and that the company has started an internal investigation on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company “fully respects any third-party’s intellectual property rights and confidential information. The company has been complying and will comply [with] all applicable laws and regulations,” she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cao and Zoox could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is building a vehicle assembly facility in Shanghai, putting it in direct competition with Xiaopeng and other Chinese companies in the world’s largest electric vehicle market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its Autopilot is a driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks and allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel, although the company stresses it still requires driver supervision and does not make the vehicle autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cao's LinkedIn profile shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/guangzhi-cao-a667574&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; he has been working with Xiaopeng since January as &quot;head of perception.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xiaopeng, which debuted an electric car in Las Vegas last year, counts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Foxconn Technology Co Ltd among its investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, also known as Xpeng Motors, employs at least five former Tesla employees, the U.S. carmaker alleged in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc last year accused &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1K02RR-OCATC&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; one former employee of stealing trade secrets related to self-driving cars and joining Xiaopeng's U.S. subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies are racing to develop the technology required to make cars drive on their own and lawsuits against former employees have become common as firms strive to keep proprietary information in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit took &lt;a href=&quot;https://in.reuters.com/article/alphabet-uber-trial/waymo-accepts-245-million-and-ubers-regret-to-settle-self-driving-car-dispute-idINKBN1FT2C6&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; Uber Technologies to court after a former employee stole thousands of confidential documents and became chief of Uber's self-driving car project. Uber later paid $245 million to settle the case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Remastering Star Trek: Deep Space Nine with Machine Learning</title>

<description>As a little side-project, I have been working on putting the artificial neural networks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://topazlabs.com/ai-gigapixel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AI Gigapixel&lt;/a&gt; to the test and having them upscale another favorite thing of mine... Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9).&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iOeQ-HxfULM/XIhCDO6J5fI/AAAAAAAAGbw/EptoBlhqLIc34OW9jKJk4DjH9CFvE6lLACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/logo.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iOeQ-HxfULM/XIhCDO6J5fI/AAAAAAAAGbw/EptoBlhqLIc34OW9jKJk4DjH9CFvE6lLACK4BGAYYCw/s640/logo.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The State of Deep Space Nine&lt;/h2&gt;
Just like Final Fantasy 7, of which I am upscaling the backgrounds, textures, and videos in &lt;a href=&quot;https://captrobau.blogspot.com/p/about.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Remako mod&lt;/a&gt;, DS9 was also relegated to a non-HD future. While the popular Original Series and The Next Generation were mostly shot on film, the mid 90s DS9 had its visual effects shots (space battles and such) shot on video.&lt;p&gt;While you can rescan analog film at a higher resolution, video is digital and can't be rescanned. This makes it much costlier to remaster this TV show, which is one of the reasons why it hasn't happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remastering Star Trek: Deep Space Nine With Machine Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
This is where neural networks could come in, I thought. With tools like AI Gigapixel, I knew it might be possible the low definition frames of DS9 can be scaled up to a higher definition such as 1080p or 4K. It would never be the same as proper remastering, but it would a step in the good direction.&lt;p&gt;So I tried my hand at frame or two, to see what it could do. The results were great. AI Gigapixel uses neural networks trained on real photos. So while it did okay with upscaling the video game renders of Final Fantasy, it did amazing upscaling real-life footage and the bigger budget CGI effects of DS9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bifHhKh38to/XIgWomGKoMI/AAAAAAAAGa4/4aS2yRUzb4QeQfeEiFgP3UT_fXXadZ0IACK4BGAYYCw/s1600/f9115.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bifHhKh38to/XIgWomGKoMI/AAAAAAAAGa4/4aS2yRUzb4QeQfeEiFgP3UT_fXXadZ0IACK4BGAYYCw/s640/f9115.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original 480p definition (click to enlarge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PtX8doJgPXU/XIgXP7OYktI/AAAAAAAAGbE/Szn99tjxj4I-YurqUYRh27LhjInqY_nBwCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/f9115.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PtX8doJgPXU/XIgXP7OYktI/AAAAAAAAGbE/Szn99tjxj4I-YurqUYRh27LhjInqY_nBwCK4BGAYYCw/s640/f9115.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hYxS5AigRyU/XIge5wBE8aI/AAAAAAAAGbc/hkDXHf54d6wKN-rO9nmmoGJiuC8O7WkhwCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/thumb0636.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hYxS5AigRyU/XIge5wBE8aI/AAAAAAAAGbc/hkDXHf54d6wKN-rO9nmmoGJiuC8O7WkhwCK4BGAYYCw/s640/thumb0636.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DS9 Enhanced 1080p definition (click to enlarge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These still frames showed promise. In the first set of images, the maintenance crewmen in their spacesuits were nothing more than a few pixely blobs. The upscaling process turned the blobs into much more defined figures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The close-up of the hand also improved. The creases and folds of the fingers and hand look much more detailed, and the baseball really shows off its sheen and the intricate stitching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real test, however, was going to be if the upscaling process held up with a sequence of frames aka as a video. Would there be artifacts or other unsightly issues? AI Gigapixel was after all made for upscaling single images so it wouldn't take into account the relation between the individual frames of a moving image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I set about upscaling a portion of an episode. I settled on the season six episode: &quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot;. A great Dominion War episode that had both epic space battles and more personal face-to-face moments. And so I set out to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will go into greater detail about my process in a future blog post, but it took me about two days to get everything extracted, upscaled and put it back together in a way that was pleasing. This resulted only in the first five minutes of the episode being done (the episode recap, the opening scene, and the intro). Still pretty good time for a mid-to-high end PC with software that isn't just available to professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result left me pretty awestruck. It looked better than I had hoped. No weird issues or anything. It looked pretty much like an HD version of DS9. Since (moving) pictures are worth more than a thousand words, here are two comparison videos that show off the improvement I was able to get with this machine learning based upscaling technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shows off the before-and-after situation with still frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second puts the two videos side by side. Take note how much clearer and sharper the Enhanced version looks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;I highly recommend watching all these videos through your YouTube app on your TV if possible. It gives you more of a sense of how it would feel watching an enhanced DS9 on your TV.&lt;p&gt;Comparisons are all well and good, but what does it look like if you were to watch it normally? Below is a video of the first five minutes of the episode in full 1080p:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What About 4K?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Honestly, I don't know. While I can upscale the image to a 4K resolution, I don't have a TV or monitor with a 4K native resolution to see if it looks better. I have nonetheless made this video and I am interested to hear from people with people with 4K equipment if it looks better over the 1080p version of the intro.&lt;p&gt;This nearly melted my computer, as it is a lot more intense to upscale than 1080p so I'll stick to this single video for 4K examples of DS9 Enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/49oj2JUtn0A&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;Since I do not own DS9, I can not just do what I want with it. While I would love to release full episodes, this is just not legally possible. These videos serve more as a proof of concept for CBS to look into machine learning and neural networks to help remaster DS9 and move it a bit closer to the HD era.&lt;p&gt;Imagine what a real team could do, with more powerful equipment, custom trained neural networks (perhaps training the network on TNG vs. TNG Remastered images) and access to the original SD files instead of a DVDRip like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I will do is go into further detail about my process, which will be the subject of a future blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Facebook Stored Hundreds of Millions of User Passwords in Plain Text for Years</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of millions of &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; users had their account passwords stored in plain text and searchable by thousands of Facebook employees — in some cases going back to 2012, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Facebook says an ongoing investigation has so far found no indication that employees have abused access to this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-30789&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/facebook_dislike_china_-_Google_Search.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;392&quot; height=&quot;362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is probing a series of security failures in which employees built applications that logged unencrypted password data for Facebook users and stored it in plain text on internal company servers. That’s according to a senior Facebook employee who is familiar with the investigation and who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook source said the investigation so far indicates between 200 million and 600 million Facebook users may have had their account passwords stored in plain text and searchable by more than 20,000 Facebook employees. The source said Facebook is still trying to determine how many passwords were exposed and for how long, but so far the inquiry has uncovered archives with plain text user passwords dating back to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Facebook insider said access logs showed some 2,000 engineers or developers made approximately nine million internal queries for data elements that contained plain text user passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The longer we go into this analysis the more comfortable the legal people [at Facebook] are going with the lower bounds” of affected users, the source said. “Right now they’re working on an effort to reduce that number even more by only counting things we have currently in our data warehouse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Facebook software engineer &lt;strong&gt;Scott Renfro&lt;/strong&gt; said the company wasn’t ready to talk about specific numbers — such as the number of Facebook employees who could have accessed the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renfro said the company planned to alert affected Facebook users, but that no password resets would be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve not found any cases so far in our investigations where someone was looking intentionally for passwords, nor have we found signs of misuse of this data,” Renfro said. “In this situation what we’ve found is these passwords were inadvertently logged but that there was no actual risk that’s come from this. We want to make sure we’re reserving those steps and only force a password change in cases where there’s definitely been signs of abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A written statement from Facebook provided to KrebsOnSecurity says the company expects to notify “hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users, tens of millions of other Facebook users, and tens of thousands of Instagram users.” Facebook Lite is a version of Facebook designed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/348076/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-facebook-and-facebook-lite/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;low speed connections and low-spec phones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-says-bug-exposed-account-passwords/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/05/twitter-to-all-users-change-your-password-now/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; were forced to admit similar stumbles in recent months, but in both of those cases the plain text user passwords were available to a relatively small number of people within those organizations, and for far shorter periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renfro said the issue first came to light in January 2019 when security engineers reviewing some new code noticed passwords were being inadvertently logged in plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This prompted the team to set up a small task force to make sure we did a broad-based review of anywhere this might be happening,” Renfro said. “We have a bunch of controls in place to try to mitigate these problems, and we’re in the process of investigating long-term infrastructure changes to prevent this going forward. We’re now reviewing any logs we have to see if there has been abuse or other access to that data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s password woes come amid a tough month for the social network. Last week, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-data-deals-investigation.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into data deals Facebook struck with some of the world’s largest tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in March, Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/03/facebook-phone-number-look-up/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; from security and privacy experts for using phone numbers provided for security reasons — like two-factor authentication — for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1101402001907372032&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;other things&lt;/a&gt; (like marketing, advertising and making users searchable by their phone numbers across the social network’s different platforms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:43 a.m.:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook has posted a statement about this incident &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/keeping-passwords-secure/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I turned down my Y Combinator interview</title>
<link>https://www.facetdev.com/blog/posts/why-i-turned-down-my-y-combinator-interview/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.facetdev.com/blog/posts/why-i-turned-down-my-y-combinator-interview/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It had been 2 months since I left the second company I founded, Numetric. In just 3 short years I’d built the company from nothing to a working product, dozens of customers, 40 employees and enough recurring revenue to raise over $16M in venture funding from some of the world’s top VCs. And then I got fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting fired from the company you founded sucks - but that’s a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last day at Numetric, I was excited to get started building my next company. I spent a couple of months going through the list of ideas I had filed away during my time at Numetric. Most of them were off the table because of the non-compete with Numetric, but one felt sufficiently novel that I decided to focus on it. On my third day at my new company, I completed my Y Combinator application and sent it off. Sure, I didn’t have much of a company yet, but I had a pretty strong resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later I got an email from interviews@ycombinator.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.facetdev.com/blog/uploads/y-combinator-email.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Y Combinator acceptance email&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled! I’d made a ton of progress since applying and I was excited to pitch my new startup. It’s always validating to get confirmation from VCs, especially a VC as prestigious as YC, that you startup has merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I started to reflect on my experience as a founder/CEO over the past 8 years. I’d spent the first four years building a bootstrapped company and it was amazing! We were profitable, we were growing fast, and I was working just 40 hours a week. The next three and a half years I spent building a VC backed startup were complete hell, and I’m not sure if I’ll ever see any payoff for all my hard work. Did I really want to put myself through that again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I didn’t. I’d also experienced first hand many of the drawbacks of raising VC funding. So I emailed the wonderful folks at YC and told them I wasn’t ready and thanked them for the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, bootstrapping is a better choice for most software engineers, especially if you are first time founder. Let me explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-startup-isn-t-going-to-become-a-unicorn&quot;&gt;Your startup isn’t going to become a unicorn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.facetdev.com/blog/uploads/rainbow-unicorn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Rainbow unicorn&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I had lunch with my buddy Dan. He’s always pretty up-beat, but he seemed happier than usual. That was probably because he recently sold his company for $100M! We talked about the tradeoffs of raising VC funding vs bootstrapping a company. “One of the problems with VCs,” I say, “is that they don’t have the same amount of skin in the game that you have as a founder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan replies, “No, it’s not that they don’t have the same amount of skin in the game, it’s that &lt;strong&gt;they are playing a completely different game!&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s right. There’s only one of you. You are going to be investing the next five to ten years of your life building ONE company. All your eggs are in this one basket. You’ll make a small salary, but the majority of your reward will come when you sell your company. That means you need to do everything you can to increase the odds of success, and decrease the risk of failure. You need a 100% win rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VCs don’t. VCs can spread their bets across multiple companies. They only need a small percentage of their investments to succeed. It’s totally acceptable for them to invest $10M in a company and see that money completely evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture capital firms make money by managing large sums of money for wealthy individuals, pension funds, etc. They charge their customers, called limited partners (LPs), 2% per year to manage their money. For example, Sequoia Capitals most recent fund is $8B. They earn $165M/year in management fees, even if they produce no return for their LPs. They also get a 20% cut of all the profit the fund earns. If Sequoia produced a 50% return on their latest fund, then they earn an extra $800M. If they fail to produce a return, then they still get their management fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture backed companies only have about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbinsights.com/research/unicorn-conversion-rate/&quot;&gt;1% chance of reaching a $1B valuation&lt;/a&gt;. VCs have built a business model that allows them to be successful with such a low founder success rate. Your VC partner will have a fantastic salary, while at the same time encouraging you to pay yourself as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire system of venture capital is designed to produce a small number of very large companies. Everything, from the advice on selecting startup ideas to the expectation for hyper growth, is tainted by this bias. They rely on the overly optimistic nature of startup founders who think they are the one the special one, they are the 1 in a 100. I’m sorry, but you aren’t the 1. You are the 99 and your startup isn’t going to become a unicorn. Let that sink in - your startup isn’t going to become a unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why play a game that has such terrible odds of winning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-pies-are-better&quot;&gt;Small pies are better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.facetdev.com/blog/uploads/pie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pie&quot;/&gt; You’ll hear VCs say all the time: “A small piece of a big pie is better than a large piece of a small pie.” The problem with that claim is that it leaves risk out of the equation. &lt;strong&gt;The risk profile of your company increases dramatically when you take VC funding&lt;/strong&gt;. You start spending more money than you are earning, your focus shifts to raising your next round, and your VC now has veto authority over the sale of your company. Your company is now a ticking time-bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “big pie” idea also ignores the fact that it is several orders of magnitude harder to create a “big pie” than it is to create a small pie, even with their funding. Company sizes follow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law&quot;&gt;power law&lt;/a&gt; distribution. There just aren’t as many $1B markets out there in the world. In fact, it’s comparatively easy to build a $10M business versus a $100M or $1B business. How big of a piece of pie do you really need to meet your goals? $10M? $50M?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most founders over estimate how much of the company they will still own when the company exits. If you start with 50%, there’s a good chance you’ll end up owning only 5-10% of your company after your Series C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question you should be asking yourself is, “Would I rather have a large piece of a small pie or &lt;em&gt;a chance at&lt;/em&gt; a small piece of a much bigger pie?” Sounds much less appealing if you look at it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first time founder, you should be shooting for a small pie. Small pies are great! A “small” exit of $10M or $30M would completely change your life. After you’ve gotten your small pie exit, you can comfortably afford to take a big risk with your next company. You’ll be able to self-fund your next startup and you’ll also be able to negotiate better terms if you decide to raise funding. Or you could just retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;profitable-companies-are-better&quot;&gt;Profitable companies are better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can increase your chances of success by building a company that produces a profit. I feel stupid writing that last sentence, but I feel like the software industry is so caught up in the cult of VC that we’ve lost sight of this most basic principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you raise venture capital, you will have to spend the money you raise. That means increasing the amount of money you are spending to be greater than the amount of money you are earning. You’ll hire people, get a bigger office, spend on marketing and hope that your revenue catches up with your new spending level or hope that you can raise more money, before your bank account is $0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first job as CEO is to not run out of money. Let me tell you, even if all the other metrics are going up and to the right, if your bank account is decreasing, you will feel it. The stress and anxiety is immense and it takes a toll on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse is also true. If your bank account is increasing, you will feel it - and it feels great! There is nothing like knowing you have created a &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; business that actually &lt;strong&gt;makes money&lt;/strong&gt;. Imagine you own a machine that legally prints money. Seriously, take a second and envision it in your mind. That’s literally what it feels like owning a company that is profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit gives you options. Want to spend more money on marketing? You can! Want to hire more devs? Do it! Want to give your employees better health insurance? Yep. Want to hold an executive meeting in the Bahamas? That’s fine. Want to write yourself a check for $200,000? Ok! It’s your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit also makes it easier to sell your company. It turns out that people like buying businesses that produce a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fundraising-is-a-full-time-job&quot;&gt;Fundraising is a full-time job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job as the founder and CEO will be much different if you raise venture capital. You are responsible for raising the venture capital. Each round of fundraising takes 3-6 months and will consume almost all of your time until the money is in the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking about fundraising with the CEO of a VC backed company who had just taken his company public. His advice was to spend as little time as possible fundraising. I dug deeper. “So fundraising takes 6 months on average. You raise enough to last for 24 months, but you always end up needing twice as much as you were expecting. That means you need money again 12 months after you finished your last raise. If it takes 6 months to close a round of funding, that means you should start fundraising again just 6 months after you closed your last round.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reply, “Hmm, yeah, you’re pretty much always fundraising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably spent 40-50% of my total time at Numetric fundraising. Not exactly what I had in mind when I started the company. I wanted to be designing product, meeting customers, and building a team. When you are fundraising, your focus is off your business and the business suffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-personal-motivations&quot;&gt;Other personal motivations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are a few of the biggest reasons I chose not to go through YC or raise any venture capital this time around. There are other things that are important to me that I didn’t want to give up, like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have total control over my company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t be fired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have better work/life balance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have less managerial overhead (no board meetings or investor reports)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can grow at a comfortable pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I decided to go back to the first company I ever started and see if I could turn it around. I’ve been back at the helm of Facet for 3 months now. My goal is to build a profitable small pie business that I can one day sell for a $50M. I’m going to be sharing the intimate details of our journey, including our goals, plans, strategies, revenue and profit numbers. If you want to watch us bootstrap Facet, you can subscribe to the blog at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tl-dr-you-don-t-need-venture-capital&quot;&gt;tl;dr You don’t need venture capital&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture capital gets so much attention in the media that it’s easy to forget that it’s not actually necessary. Software is pretty magical - you can produce so much value at such a low cost. As a software engineer, you have all the tools and skills you need to build a product and deliver it to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping a profitable company has never been easier for software engineers. You can even bootstrap your company while still working at your full-time job or doing contract work (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facetdev.com&quot;&gt;through Facet!&lt;/a&gt;). Once you have a product that customers are paying for, and the risk is much lower, you can go all in.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Why I Turned Down My Y Combinator Interview</og:title>
<og:description>It had been 2 months since I left the second company I founded, Numetric. In just 3 short years I’d built the company from nothing to a working product, dozens of customers, 40 employees and enough recurring revenue to raise over $16M in venture funding from some of the world’s top VCs. And then I got fired. Getting fired from the company you founded sucks - but that’s a story for another day.</og:description>

<title>There is no reason to cross the U.S. by train, but I did it anyway</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The whale sighting&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;happened&lt;/strong&gt; right away, minutes into Day 1. Jon, Dave and I had just been dropped off on a remote Alaskan shoreline, an hour and a half by boat from the closest speck of a town. Jon was working as a sea-kayaking guide that summer in Glacier Bay National Park, and he had invited us up for a seven-day excursion during his week off. As the boat that delivered us vanished, the drone of its engine dampening into a murmur and then finally trailing off, it became unthinkably quiet on the beach, and the largeness and strangeness of our surroundings were suddenly apparent. It was a familiar phenomenon for Jon from the start of all his trips: a moment that people instinctually paused to soak in. To me, it felt like those scenes of astronauts who, having finally rattled free of the earth’s atmosphere, slip into the stillness of space. Except we weren’t in space. We were on earth — finally, really on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;We were only starting to move around again, packing our gear into the kayaks, when we heard the first huff of a blowhole, not far offshore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon was ecstatic. It seemed to him as if the animal were putting on a show, swimming playfully in the kelp, diving, resurfacing, then plowing its open mouth across the surface to feed. He took it as a good omen. Though I had no idea at the time, he was anxious that Dave and I might feel intimidated about making the trip; such a big payoff, so quickly, would get us excited and defuse any apprehensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;For Dave, the whale-sighting had exactly the opposite effect. Once, when he was a kid, his dad took him scuba diving with dolphins. They were friendly, awe-inspiring creatures, purportedly, but they terrified Dave instead. He could still conjure the feeling of hanging defenselessly in that water while the animals deftly swirled around him, less like solid objects than flashes of reflected light, while he could move only in comparative slow-motion. Ever since, he had harbored a fear of large sea creatures — a niche phobia, particularly for a young man who lived in the Bronx, but a genuine one still. And so, even as Dave understood that a chance to see whales up close like this was a major draw of a kayaking trip in Alaska, and though he feigned being thrilled, some second thoughts were kicking in: We were going out there, he realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The whale left me exhilarated and gleeful, like Jon; but deeper down, I also remember feeling shaken, like Dave. Nothing about the animal registered to me as playful or welcoming. It just appeared in the distance, then transited quickly past us, from left to right. My uneasiness had something to do with the whale’s great size and indifference — its obliviousness — as it passed. Watching it made me feel profoundly out of place and register how large that wilderness was, relative to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;At the time, I was working at a literary magazine in New York City called The Hudson Review, picking poems out of the slush pile and mailing them to an outside panel of editorial advisers. I was trying hard in my letters to impress one of them: Hayden Carruth, a gruff and irreverent 81-year-old poet who lived far upstate. I loved Carruth’s work but was more enamored with his persona: his yeoman life in the woods, his intolerance for phoniness and, most of all, the precision with which he articulated common suffering, including one strain of his own suffering that I related to, particularly in those years, but wouldn’t have had the courage, or clarity, to examine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I had always been aware,” Carruth once wrote of his youth, “that the Universe is sad; everything in it, animate or inanimate, the wild creatures, the stones, the stars, was enveloped in the great sadness, pervaded by it. ... Never then or now have I been able to look at a cloudless sky at night and see beauty there. A kind of grandeur, yes — but not beauty. The profusion and variety of celestial lights have always frightened me. Why are they there? Why these instead of others? Why these instead of nothing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;That was how I felt, watching the whale from the beach: afraid that everything was accidents. Then again, maybe it’s just hard to picture the start of the trip in retrospect without amplifying some feeling of foreboding. Something else Carruth wrote that has always stuck with me: “The wilderness begins at the edge of my body, at the edge of my consciousness, and extends to the edge of the universe, and it is filled with menace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/22/magazine/voyages-kayaking-across-ocean-at-70.html&quot;&gt;[Read about Aleksander Doba, the 71-year-old who kayaked across the Atlantic 3 times.]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was mid-August&lt;/strong&gt; 2002, and we were 23, 24 and 25. We had graduated from college together two years earlier. Dave, whom I also grew up with, shot out of undergrad knowing he wanted to be a doctor and had just finished his first year of medical school. Any similar momentum I had after graduation was instantly sapped. Three nights after I returned to my parents’ house from school, I found myself driving my father to the emergency room. Three weeks after that, he died. My grief was disorienting and total; at a moment in life when everything is supposed to feel possible, making any single decision became impossible. I gave into that sadness for the better part of a year, resettling at home in New Jersey with my widowed mother and sliding back to the summer job I worked during school, glumly breaking down beef at a butcher shop two towns over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I coped with my fatherlessness and confusion in ways I’m not proud of and still don’t understand. I read a lot of books about Ronald Reagan, for example, even the collection of his love letters to Nancy. I also lashed out at Dave, who was living at home that summer, too, studying for the MCAT. He withdrew awkwardly after the funeral, and I suppose I was happy to hold that against him. It triggered some longstanding jealousy. A part of me always resented how he seemed unfairly exempt from the self-doubt and heaviness that I was prone to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon, meanwhile, was teaching at a rustic little boarding school in Switzerland, where his mother was from. The summer after graduation, before starting the job, he set out for Alaska with a friend, sleeping in the bed of their old pickup. In the minuscule town of Gustavus, the gateway to Glacier Bay, he picked up seasonal work in the warehouse of a kayak-tour company. Jon had little actual experience of sea kayaking but had always felt drawn to the ocean in the abstract. In college, he and another friend plotted out a paddling expedition near Glacier Bay, across the border in Canada and applied for a grant from our school to fund it. The grant was set up in memory of an alumnus who died in an avalanche while mountaineering. It was meant to encourage the “responsible and conscientious pursuit of wilderness expeditions.” Safety was key. But the committee rejected Jon and his partner’s application. They seemed insufficiently prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;That wasn’t surprising. Jon grew up doing a lot of backcountry camping and was a competent outdoorsman, but putting together a grant application required a kind of administrative fastidiousness he didn’t always possess. He was bright but scatterbrained, forever picking up things and putting them down, both figuratively (music projects, conversations) but also literally. I can still picture him hustling around the house we shared in college, hunting for his keys or his soldering iron, having gotten in over his head rewiring some device. He was an artist; one piece I remember consisted of a half-peeled banana, implanted with circuitry and suspended in a jar of formaldehyde. Once, he grew grass in our upstairs bathroom — a living bathmat, he said — until the turf became muddy and flooded the downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;This was Jon’s third summer in Alaska, and he’d worked his way up to leading expeditions, taking out vacationers for days at a time. Our trip, however, would venture beyond the typical circuit, into a remote corner of the park that he’d never been to. Jon had no serious concerns about our safety, but he felt he bore responsibility for our emotional well-being. To enjoy ourselves, we would need to feel comfortable, not just in the wilderness but also with him as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He suspected we wouldn’t trust him entirely. We didn’t. We knew him before he became a professional guide, and our perception of his expertise lagged behind the reality. “With Jon,” Dave told me, “it was always unclear to what extent he’d thought everything through.” Dave remembered landing in Gustavus the night before we got underway and casually asking Jon a lot of questions: Where are we going, exactly? Do we have everything we need? Jon seemed to have solid answers for all of them. As we headed back to his place for a good night’s sleep, he told us to wait in the yard. He was living alone for the summer in a house that an acquaintance was building in the woods. The structure was framed-up but largely wall-less, and Jon, to be safe, needed to check that no moose had wandered in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After a spectacular&lt;/strong&gt; first day of paddling, we came ashore on a rocky tidal flat about two miles from where we were dropped. Jon gave us his detailed tutorial about bear safety while we set up our campsite. He taught us, for example, to holler “Hey, bear!” if we heard any rustling but also preventively, ahead of us, when we walked through the woods. The last thing you wanted was to come across a brown bear unannounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Hey, bear!” Jon kept hollering, by way of demonstration. He said it goofily, like a children’s TV host greeting some down-on-his-luck ursine neighbor at the doorway to their clubhouse. This was intentional. Jon had noticed that the people on his trips often resisted bellowing “Hey, bear!” into the wilderness. It was essential for their safety, but it felt silly or vulnerable somehow, like singing in public. So he learned to turn it into a shtick, spinning it into a stream-of-consciousness narration: Hey, bear, I’m coming into the trees now. Hope you’re having a fantastic evening, Mr. Bear! It loosened everyone up. They were performing for their friends now; the whole group was in on the joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I had never seen a wild bear, though I have backpacked in bear country a handful of times. I felt comfortable with the animals in the abstract. But here, the bears weren’t abstract; they breached the material plane. There were bear trails everywhere, leading from the tree line to the water, and disquietingly close, I felt, to where we were pitching our tent. We found heaps of their scat. We saw trees where the animals had slashed off the bark to eat the inner layer, tufts of fur from their paws still plastered in the sap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I pretended I was having fun. But that evening I grew increasingly petrified, almost delirious. My eyes tightened, scanning for bears. The sound of the wind became bears, and so did the mossy sticks cracking under our feet. I gave myself a migraine, then phased in and out of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;At sunrise, I woke feeling foolish. While Jon cooked pancakes, I reasoned with myself, privately, in a notebook I brought on the trip. I tried to conceive of the situation as a geometry problem. Yes, some number of bears roved this landscape, I wrote: relatively tiny, independent blips, going about their business randomly, just like us. In all that empty space and confusion, a lethal collision of their moving blips and our moving blips would be an improbable coincidence. I’d been distorting those odds, mistaking myself for “the absolute focus of all bears’ attention,” I wrote. It was embarrassing, really. “To be afraid of bears,” I concluded, “is to be narcissistic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I was reminding myself that freakishly horrible things are, by definition, unlikely to happen. Even now, my reasoning feels sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/22/magazine/voyages-joshua-tree-lost-hiker.html&quot;&gt;[Read about the search for a missing hiker in Joshua Tree’s wild interior.]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2 was&lt;/strong&gt; a slog. We paddled through a spitting drizzle in an endless straight line, along the high granite walls of the coast. We talked less and less, just pushed through the emerald chop. Then eventually we gave up, hauling in our boats and making camp in a wide, crescent-shaped cove, short of the site that Jon originally picked out on his map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;We had entered Dundas Bay, a rarely visited pocket of the national park that, I’ve since learned, has a storied history as a hide-out for solitary misanthropes. In the 1930s, one prospector built a cabin not far from our campsite and brandished a gun at the Alaska Natives who passed through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;We intuited that the scenery was beautiful, but we could see very little of it through the fog. Our guidebook explained that “the east side of the bay” — where we were — “can get extremely rough during foul weather, since large waves roll in ... and batter this shoreline.” That was happening now: The weather that plinked at us all afternoon was roiling into a storm. Soon, the big rain started. We rushed through dinner, then loafed in our tent until, eventually, the loafing turned to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A local newspaper would later describe the storm as “short but intense.” In Gustavus, a creek swelled to about a foot higher than its previous record. Gale winds, with gusts up to 59 miles per hour, turned back two cruise ships in Skagway, about 85 miles north. Around 2 a.m., we woke to discover the wind had shorn the rain fly off our tent. Jon’s sleeping bag and mine were soaked, while Dave was snug and dry between us. We heard torrents of water lashing down and the waves crashing in the cove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;We got up three or four hours later. The rain and wind no longer felt ferocious but were still too gnarly to paddle through; there was no question, Jon said, that we were staying put. We cooked breakfast and took turns playing chess in the tent. By late morning, the storm seemed to have passed. We were antsy. We figured we would take a look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The terrain was crammed with thickets of alder and spruce, underlain by ferns and a furor of prickly things. Jon pointed out devil’s club: three or four feet tall and leafy, armored up and down with spines. The plant pierced fleece and hurt like fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;There were no trails. We’d been trudging for some time when we reached a fast-moving stream, maybe 10 feet wide. Jon was surprised; it wasn’t on his map, most likely just a drainage bloated by the storm. We followed it downstream, looking for a way across, and eventually found it bridged by a hefty tree trunk. It seemed like an easy crossing. Jon stepped up and led the way, and Dave and I waited in a single-file line on the stream bank behind him. The creek was loud, like a factory with all its gears and rollers churning. Looking down, Jon realized there was more water than he’d thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;That’s when I heard the snap in the woods behind me. After all my paranoia, I instantly understood that the many bears I’d thought I heard before were absolutely not bears — were nothing — because this sound was so unmistakable and crisp, so explicitly something. I turned and hollered, “Hey, bear!” then waited a beat. Maybe I said “Hey, bear!” again; I’m not sure. But I must have scanned those trees long enough to feel satisfied and safe, because I know I was turning my head, to go back to my friends, when I saw the dark shape rushing forward in my peripheral vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I heard&lt;/strong&gt; must have been roots popping. If a tree is large enough, you can apparently hear them cracking underground like gunfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The thud was seismic. The trunk crashed down right next to me. Mapping out bits of evidence later, we concluded that the tree must have been about 80 feet tall and perhaps two feet in diameter. It was some kind of conifer — a spruce or cedar. I screamed, involuntarily, “Look out!” then watched Dave, a few steps directly in front of me, dive sideways and hit the ground. When I got to him, he was crouching, stunned but O.K. He looked up and said, “Go get Jon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;It hadn’t clicked back in for me: There were three of us. The sight of Dave going down had canceled out everything else. I scrambled out over the creek, running across the tree that had just fallen, shouting Jon’s name, then spotted him in the water, tangled in a snarl of sheared-off branches near the bank behind me — a cage, which kept him from hurtling downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He did not know he’d been hit by a falling tree. It had narrowly missed his head, struck his left shoulder, shearing it from his collarbone and breaking many of his ribs. Later, a doctor would explain that the downward force had been so powerful that it had probably squashed Jon’s entire upper body, and all the organs inside, down toward his waist, momentarily compressing him like a bellows; for a split second, his shoulders headed in the direction of his bellybutton, before his torso sprang up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon had heard nothing, seen nothing. He was turning around to help Dave onto the log — again, feeling responsible for our safety — and the next thing he knew, he was in the water. He tried to reach out his left arm but could not make it move. He could not move his legs. He felt a bolt of pain down his spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon later described flashing through an idiosyncratic sequence of thoughts, all in a few milliseconds, as if watching a deck of cards fanning across a table. One was an image of himself in a wheelchair, sitting behind a mixing console in a fancy recording studio. “I guess I can become a recording engineer in a wheelchair,” he remembered thinking. He had never worked in a recording studio and, though he played music, he had no particular plans to. Still, this vision apparently felt like an acceptable future and freed him to resurface in the present. That was when he registered me, screaming his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon told himself he shouldn’t move. He knew from his many wilderness first-responder trainings that moving a person with spinal injuries risks paralysis. Then again, he also knew that most of his body was submerged in cold water, and he recognized that he risked dying of hypothermia if he didn’t move. “If I’m already paralyzed,” he concluded, “I may as well move.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He somehow hoisted himself out of the stream before Dave or I got to him, using his right arm and his chin and biting into something loamy with his teeth, for additional leverage. He reassessed the situation: better. Also: worse. He now realized that we were at least a mile inland from our camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Suddenly, his body was walking; his legs just started working. Dave and I put him between us, supporting his frame. He was moving faster than we expected, but uncoordinatedly. Then he crumpled between us. We tried again; Jon was dead weight. Dave noticed that his breathing was shallow and his voice was low — signs, Dave knew from med school, of a collapsed lung. He began battering Jon with a pep talk, telling him, firmly, that he had to get up, that we had to get out of here. Jon didn’t need that explained to him; he was cogent and still trying to plot our next steps in his mind. He looked down to see why this log he was resting on was so lumpy and realized that he was, in fact, sitting on his left arm. The arm was slack, obviously broken; his sleeve, pierced up and down with devil’s club. Jon had zero feeling in it. He found it amusing, this sensation of complete estrangement from one of his limbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon had been stressing that it was important to stay together. But this was another theory of wilderness survival that appeared to be breaking down in practice. Someone would have to get on the radio back at our camp. By chance, while marooned in our tent during the rainstorm the night before, Jon showed us how to use the device, though he did it almost as a formality; the hand-held VHF unit was merely a line-of-sight radio, he told us, meaning its range was small, its signal too weak to pass through most obstacles. You were unlikely to reach anyone you couldn’t see, and we hadn’t seen anyone since a faraway fishing boat, early on Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;There was a moment of discussion, or maybe just an exchange of looks between me and Dave. I told Dave he should go. I didn’t trust myself to find my way back. I also knew that I lacked the courage to try; whether I was being sensible or cowardly, I still don’t know. Besides, I took for granted that Dave would make it. He was more capable in my mind, less likely to cinch himself in indecisive knots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Recently, though, Dave told me: “You probably had no idea how much in my own head I was. I know that you, growing up, definitely felt insecure about things, and I think you looked at me and thought, Dave has everything figured out. But I had so much anxiety.” He brought up the tremor he used to have in his hands. I knew about it; in high school, we waited tables together, and I occasionally had to carry out Dave’s soup orders, so he wouldn’t spill. But I guess I thought of the tremor as strictly physiological. I couldn’t see the vulnerability causing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Now, as Dave sprinted away from me and Jon, swatting devil’s club from his path with the rubberized sleeve of his rain jacket, his nerves rose up and rattled him. He worried he wouldn’t be able to find the radio once he got back or know how to turn it on. What if he broke the radio, foreclosing whatever marginal chance we had of getting help? There were lots of ways to screw this up, Dave realized. More occurred to him as he ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He found the radio. He turned it on. Then, having solved these problems, he encountered another he hadn’t anticipated: “What is the appropriate thing you’re supposed to say?” he remembered thinking. On TV, you see a lot of people saying “Mayday.” And so, Dave faced the open water and started broadcasting into the fog: “Mayday, Mayday.” Even in that moment, though, alone on a beach in the middle of nowhere, he felt slightly self-conscious about it. This is so goddamn cliché, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back in the woods,&lt;/strong&gt; kneeling over Jon, I was having the same problem: I didn’t know what to say. He was lying near a log on his injured side, his beard and glasses flecked with dirt and tendrils of moss. He seemed to be on the brink of losing consciousness. At no time would the possibility of Jon’s dying surface concretely in any of our minds. Still, I knew I was supposed to keep talking to him, to tether him to the world with my voice somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I started vamping platitudes: We were going to get out of here soon, and so forth. But I could feel myself treading water, even blundering, at one point, into a long-winded apology, worried I overstayed my welcome that one Christmas with his family. I was afraid that the helplessness in my voice might be counterproductive, unsettling Jon instead of steadying him. It was a tremendous silence to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;What can a person say? I had two literature professors in college who made us memorize poems. You never knew when some lines of verse would come in handy, they claimed. One liked to brag that, while traveling through Ireland, he found that if he spat out some Yeats at a pub, he could drink free. This is how I wound up reciting a love poem to Jon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;It was “The Shampoo,” by Elizabeth Bishop, a lyric poem about the enormity of time, which turns startlingly intimate at the end, when Bishop offers to shampoo her lover’s silvering hair: “Come, let me wash it in this big tin basin,/battered and shiny like the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;After that, I imagine I also did some W.H. Auden; I knew a fair amount of Auden back then. The stuff in rhyme and meter was always easiest to memorize — “Looking up at the stars, I know quite well/That, for all they care, I can go to hell” — which is why I had a lot of Robert Frost at my disposal as well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening&quot;&gt;“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken&quot;&gt;“The Road Not Taken.”&lt;/a&gt; For the most part, I trafficked in hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon and I would spend about an hour and a half together alone on the forest floor. I ran through everything in my quiver — Kay Ryan, A.R. Ammons, Michael Donaghy — padding each poem with little prefatory remarks, while Jon said nothing, just signaled with his eyes or produced a sound whenever I checked in. I felt like a radio D.J. playing records in the middle of the night, unsure if anyone was listening. And here’s one about owls by Richard Wilbur, I would tell Jon, and off we would go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I must have also done at least one by Hayden Carruth, my curmudgeonly pen pal at the literary magazine. Carruth’s poems didn’t lend themselves to memorization, but I’d worked hard to nail one of my favorites, in which he describes stopping to notice a deer standing in an apple thicket, then realizing the northern lights are flaring overhead. Hayden and the animal pass a moment in stillness together. “We are proud to be afraid,” he writes, “proud to share/the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars.” Relative to that boundless violence above them, he and the deer are momentarily allied, though still not entirely connected: “a glimpse, an acknowledgment/it is enough and never enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;That’s what I said to my friend, powerlessly, tenting my jacket over his face when it started to rain. The title of the poem is: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42586/i-know-i-remember-but-how-can-i-help-you&quot;&gt;“I Know, I Remember, But How Can I Help You.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Coast Guard&lt;/strong&gt; cutter Mustang wasn’t where it was supposed to be. The 110-foot patrol boat normally spent its time coursing through the Gulf of Alaska, inspecting halibut-fishing vessels, or circulating, as a terrorist deterrent, near the oil terminals at Valdez. It was home-ported in Seward, hundreds of miles from Glacier Bay. But the crew was transiting to Juneau for a training when, a few days earlier, they were smacked by the same storm that later poured inland, over us. “We had gotten absolutely pummeled,” John Roberts, a petty officer on the Mustang, told me recently. For two days, the boat swished around in 15-foot-plus seas. Many on the crew had been hunkered in the mess deck, vomiting, while Roberts and a couple of his shipmates did their best to cover everyone’s watches. Finally, the Mustang slipped into Glacier Bay to find some protection. The weather started to ease. That afternoon, as Roberts piloted the Mustang east, toward Dundas Bay, his pallid crewmates were finally staggering back up to the bridge, asking where the hell they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;That was when Dave’s Mayday call came through. The signal on the Mustang’s radio was thin and faint, barely edging into range. Another of the ship’s petty officers, Eamon McCormack, explained to me that in retrospect the connection feels “mind-boggling.” Glacier Bay National Park extends over more than 5,000 square miles. Our signal would have covered two or three miles at most. And yet, a boat — a Coast Guard boat, no less — happened to be passing through that exceedingly small window at precisely the right time. “I don’t know if, nine times out of 10, you play that over again and the outcome would be the same,” McCormack said. A moment earlier or later — seconds, potentially — and we might have slipped out of alignment. The moving boat would have cruised out of range, uncoupling from us forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was 1:25 p.m&lt;/strong&gt;. when the Mustang received Dave’s call, according to one of the subsequent Coast Guard reports. Roberts couldn’t believe it. “Come on, man, I’m tired,” he said aloud, wearily, to the receiver in front of him. Roberts waited for a moment, per protocol, on the off chance that the Coast Guard’s central communications center in Juneau would pick up the call instead. Then he turned and asked his watch commander to pull out all the standardized search-and-rescue paperwork. He was steeling himself, resummoning his professionalism. “I guess we’re doing this,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Roberts was the crew member on the Mustang with the most current medical training; he would complete his E.M.T. certification the following month. As he started firing questions at Dave on the radio, he didn’t like the answers that he heard coming back: the shallowness of Jon’s breathing, the likelihood of a punctured lung. More fundamental, Roberts remembered: “Any time a tree falls on somebody, it’s not good.” He was also unsettled to learn that Dave and I both lived in New York City — a red flag, he had found, when someone winds up in trouble in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;We were 100 nautical miles from the nearest hospital; a half-day trip, even in ideal conditions. The Mustang requested that the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka send a helicopter, but the immediate plan was for Roberts and three crewmates to peel toward shore in the ship’s Zodiac and track us down. Dave had found the flare in Jon’s emergency kit and now, at 2:20, with the Zodiac underway, the Coast Guard asked him to fire it. He was still in front of our campsite, facing the water. He’d never shot off a flare before. He aimed straight up, then watched as the bright tracer rose and arced somewhere far behind him, deep in the woods. He was uncertain whether this counted as a success. He started scanning the fog in front of him, but the Zodiac never appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Someone on the Mustang caught sight of the flare near the end of its arc and immediately directed the crew on the Zodiac toward it, steering them far away from Dave to the opposite side of the little peninsula we’d camped on. And yet, this was lucky: they wound up coming ashore much closer to where I was waiting in the woods with Jon. Soon, whatever poem I was reciting was interrupted by whistles blowing and voices calling, and eventually three shapes, wearing hard hats and heavy orange rain gear, rushed toward us out of the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Roberts was especially impressive, a reassuringly large Boston-area native with a booming voice. He knelt and took Jon’s vitals. The information was troubling: his pulse was 60 beats per minute; his breathing, fast and shallow. They put his neck in a brace and eased him onto a kind of truncated backboard, called a Miller board, to move him out to the beach. Dave had returned by then. He and I crouched at one end of the board, near Jon’s feet, as someone — presumably Roberts — bellowed a count of three to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Later that night, lying down to sleep in a bed-and-breakfast in Gustavus — stunned and depleted, but dry and warm — Dave and I would talk and talk, reviewing the entire ordeal. We had drooped into a long silence, coasting toward sleep, when Dave spoke up with one last observation. When we were getting ready to lift Jon on the backboard, he said, it occurred to him that this was one of those crisis moments you hear about, like when mothers are suddenly able to lift a car off their baby. Dave expected we were going to have superhuman strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;We did not have superhuman strength. On Roberts’s command, the men raised Jon to waist height, swiftly and seemingly perfectly level, as though their arms and deltoids were hydraulic. Then, in one motion, they took off downhill, with negligible help from us. This can’t be accurate, but I remember the sensation of being almost dragged, like children in a sled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A National Geographic&lt;/strong&gt; television crew was embedded at the Coast Guard’s air station in Sitka, filming an installment of a thrill-ride reality series. The network had sent crews to other Coast Guard stations around the country too, though this assignment appeared to hold the most dramatic potential. Air Station Sitka was unique: Its pilots were responsible for 12,000 miles of coastline, a sprawling, treacherous wilderness riven with fjords, inlets and glaciers, often buffeted by implacably horrible weather. People who went into the backcountry in Alaska had a way of getting themselves into a different magnitude of trouble, too; as Roberts put it, “When stuff happens in Alaska, it’s big.” Still, this was the television crew’s eighth day in Sitka, and as the show’s producer, Annabelle Hester, explained: “I was having calls with my bosses at headquarters saying, ‘Nothing is happening!’ We were scrambling to come up with Plan B.” Then, the Mustang’s call came in at 1:42.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“What type of injuries are we looking at?” asked the dispatcher. She was taking the call from behind a semicircular counter, like the reception desk at a midlevel corporate branch office. She had a framed snapshot of a parakeet to brighten her work space, and a photograph of a dog with a heart that said, “I Woof You.” A cameraman stood conspicuously beside her, holding a tense, tight shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Probable broken ribs, a definite broken arm,” said the man on the other end. Then his voice faltered, seemed to give up: “And whatever else would happen to you if a tree fell on you,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The dispatcher retrieved the appropriate paperwork and scribbled “Tree fell on person” on one line. She read the current weather aloud: “30 knots wind, 300 ceiling, heavy rain and one-mile vis.” That would soon be revised: the ceiling had dropped to 100 feet. Entering the weather conditions on one of the Coast Guard incident reports, someone would write, in a kind of nihilistic catchall: “Extremely terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Coast Guard’s policy was to deploy a helicopter within 30 minutes of the initial request, but the Air Station’s operations officer, Cmdr. Karl Baldessari, informed everyone that this mission would take longer to plan. Baldessari was a 25-year veteran of the Coast Guard, a fast-moving, sinewy man in a blousy flight suit, with a tidy mustache and spiky hair. His role at the air station was that of a firehouse chief. He was responsible for the safety of everyone working there, which meant making judicious decisions about what warranted sending them hurtling through the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;That calculus got knotty in conditions like these, though there was a baseline volatility to flying in Alaska at all. The Coast Guard didn’t let its helicopter pilots fly lead out of Sitka, no matter how much experience they had at other air stations, until they practiced difficult landings at specific locations in the region and got their egos battered a little by logging a full winter in the state. Visibility in Alaska was frequently poor; conditions changed quickly. One pilot told me about blindly tunneling through fog in the dark when his co-pilot got “caged”: The man lifted his eyes momentarily from his instruments and, without any visual references or a horizon to latch onto, found it impossible to reorient himself, lost all sense of direction and was felled by vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;During much of the year it was also cold enough, with sufficient moisture in the air, that ascending to clear the region’s many minor mountains or even just flying through a cloud risked the aircraft’s icing up. To mitigate this, the Coast Guard had laid out virtual “track lines” across the entirety of their range: a grid of GPS points and a network of paths connecting them, along which pilots could chart a course and fly at a relatively low altitude, confident they weren’t going to smash into a mountain. The system wasn’t comprehensive; the track lines got the pilots close to their destination, but ultimately they had to diverge from this GPS superhighway and fly the remaining distance the old-fashioned way, with their radar and eyes. It was like taking an exit off the interstate, except there might be a granite wall in front of you wherever you chose to get off. It was possible the pilots would travel very far — a half-mile away from whoever needed their help — only to discover that the last leg was too risky and be forced to turn back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Baldessari gathered the two pilots on duty that afternoon and the Air Station’s flight surgeon, then unrolled a large paper map. He pointed to our location, explaining: “That’s probably one of the lousiest places we fly in and out of. This Inian Pass, right here, is the worst place we could possibly go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Inian Pass is a slim channel near the center of the Icy Strait, the long, interconnected system of waterways stretching through Glacier Bay. Conditions in the Icy Strait can be bad 300 days of the year, Baldessari recently told me; wind, rain and storm surges all push through it fast from the open ocean. But Inian Pass is a narrow keyhole at the center of the strait — a mile-wide opening between a few uninhabited islands and a rocky point — where all that weather speeds up. The only way for the pilots to reach us would be to fly straight through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Nothing in the National Geographic footage, at this point, feels reassuring. The flight surgeon holds his hand over his mouth and bites his lip. The co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, only a few months into his posting in Alaska, mills around and fidgets with his ear. It’s obvious Baldessari needs convincing. He wasn’t eager to send his men up if he didn’t have to and wasn’t certain they would make it all the way there if he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It’s kind of funny,” he told the pilots, pointing at the map. “You’ve got a boat right here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lying on his&lt;/strong&gt; backboard like a burl of driftwood, Jon was conscious and cognizant of his pain, but he had started to feel somehow buffered from his body, uninterested in connecting with the world beyond it. He would later describe himself as a “thinking blob. It was a very passive experience.” He didn’t know what was happening but could tell our momentum had stalled. He was confused and felt impatient. In his mind, the three of us had solved the impossible problem: We’d managed to get help. This was supposed to be the simple part, when everyone rushed him to the hospital. Instead, his condition deteriorated. Within 10 minutes of reaching the beach, Jon threw up. I’d never seen anything like it, a kind of dark purple gristle. I took out my wool cap to wipe his face, and he retched a second time, straight into my hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I got that all over me,” John Roberts told me recently. He’d seen vomit like that before; it meant Jon had ingested a fair amount of blood and signaled internal injuries. It made Roberts anxious. He had been on the Mustang for two and a half years at that point but had spent the previous four years in Palm Beach, a busy but less extreme posting that often involved rescuing weekend boaters from relatively close to shore — and where, Roberts pointed out, the water is warm and won’t necessarily kill you if you go in. Moreover, the bulk of the Coast Guard’s training is for maritime rescues, not rescues on land. Counterintuitive as it sounds, Roberts’s comfort level and confidence had dropped significantly once he hopped off the Zodiac and set foot on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;He reported back to the Mustang that Jon had thrown up, then soon radioed again, explaining that Jon was going into shock. He kept giving and requesting updates, trying to gauge how long this might take, and eventually started erecting a makeshift shelter out of plastic sheeting and medical tape, hoping to keep Jon out of the rain. Out of earshot of us, Roberts explained to his crew mate Eamon McCormack what the vomit meant: The possibility of Jon dying, here under their care, was real. At one point in the National Geographic footage, as Roberts’s calls are relayed to the air station in Sitka, you can see where the dispatcher clearly writes on her form: “E.M.T. does not feel comfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;By this time, the air station’s flight surgeon had received enough information to be alarmed. “It sounds like he’s got a pretty significant chest injury,” he told Baldessari. Baldessari understood they would need to launch a helicopter but warned the Mustang that the aircraft might not make it through the weather; ultimately it would be the pilots’ call, once they veered off their last track line and tried to shoot through Inian Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;They would go and give it a look, Baldessari explained over the radio, but the outlook was iffy. The guys on the beach, he said, must be prepared to get Jon back on their cutter and haul him to a hospital themselves, as fast as they could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One evening this&lt;/strong&gt; winter, my phone rang, and it was Karl Baldessari. Long retired from the Coast Guard, he was teaching aviation at a community college in Oregon, where I left a voice mail message earlier that day. I meanwhile had metamorphosed into a 40-year-old father of two and fumbled to explain to Baldessari that, as thrilled as I was to have tracked him down, I was, at the moment, racing to finish a risotto for my daughters before gymnastics practice and would have to call him back. Without missing a beat, Baldessari blared orders at me, joking, but still sounding as instinctually in charge as he did in the National Geographic footage: “O.K.,” he said, “you want to stir it constantly, but slowly!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I didn’t expect any of the Coast Guardsmen I was cold-calling to remember that day. However dramatic it remained for me, I assumed it would have been obscured in a yearslong wash of more sensational incidents. But everyone I spoke to did remember it, immediately and in detail. Baldessari had been involved in hundreds of rescue operations during his 30-year career, and yet, as I stood at the stove on the phone that evening, he told me: “The moment I listened to your voice mail, I knew exactly the case! It was almost like it was yesterday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;There was something about the supreme freakishness of the accident that left a lasting impression. For those who came ashore, the experience was also marked by a feeling of subtly escalating chaos and the pressure to surmount it. McCormack told me that ours was a story he retold endlessly, often to the younger Coast Guardsmen he was eventually tasked with training. In it was a lesson about “not taking situations that look impossible at face value,” he said. “When things start to go wrong, don’t panic or lose sight of what resources you’ve got.” Keep working the problem until its absolute end — even, McCormack added, if it means deviating from official policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;McCormack was not supposed to be landing an inflatable boat on an unforgivably rocky Alaskan shoreline, for example. But there he was, anyway, beaching the Zodiac as gingerly as he could, so that Roberts and the other men could load Jon aboard. They slid him in on his side “like a folder into a filing cabinet,” as Jon put it, and started motoring through the chop, very cautiously, back to the Mustang, about a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;As relieved as Jon had been when the Coast Guard first arrived, he also felt instantaneously more vulnerable. Strapped to the back board, his neck in the collar, he surrendered control of his body, however imperfect that control had been. He was being hauled around as an object now, with no ability to wriggle or shift positions, to manage his pain or even to turn his head and see what was happening. He was helpless, entirely dependent on the upright people operating around him, those voices he could hear discussing him on the far side of some gauzy divide. About 10 minutes into the trip on the Zodiac, Jon heard one of those voices say, “Oh, shit, we’re losing air.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A section of the Zodiac’s sponson — the inflatable fender that wraps around the boat — had punctured. One side was completely deflated. “It’s a big deal,” McCormack recently explained to me, sounding surprised that I had to ask. The sponson increases the boat’s buoyancy and stability, as well as keeping water from cresting over the side; under normal conditions, a Zodiac with a broken sponson would have been taken out of service automatically. Instead, McCormack found the puncture and wedged the nozzle of a small pump inside. Then — steering the boat with one hand, operating the throttle with the other — he started working the pump with his foot, essentially doing leg presses, to keep the fender partly inflated. The ride was already bumpy in four-foot seas. Now McCormack began tracing a slow, zigzagging course, doing what he could to tamp down the turbulence and the violence to Jon’s spine, as well as to guard against the possibility of the injured man’s suddenly bounding over the side on his backboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Roberts and the other Coast Guardsmen on the Zodiac leaned over Jon to shield him from the splash. The pain was heinous; Jon seemed to be passing out. Roberts talked to him, held his hand. Roberts felt crushed, he told me; he was torturing this guy in order to save him. When they finally reached the Mustang, rather than hoist Jon off the Zodiac, they swung the ship’s crane around and simply lifted the entire boat out of the water, level with the deck, and then carried him aboard, to keep from joggling him any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;McCormack eventually returned for me and Dave, and a half-hour later we were reunited with Jon in the Mustang’s athwartship passageway, a cramped, steel hallway, like the space between two cars of a train. Jon was still battened to the backboard, wedged up to keep the weight of his body on his less-painful side. They had cut off his clothes, though he’d murmured a plea not to — he was wearing a brand-new Patagonia jacket that he had borrowed from a friend — then swaddled him in a hypothermia blanket. Dave and I knelt and rubbed his feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The helicopter was going to make it. I don’t remember there being a grand announcement. I’m not sure we were ever made aware of the possibility that it wouldn’t. Now the crew got busy below: tying down anything that could be blown off by the rotor wash or stashing it in the mess. I also don’t remember hearing the helicopter when it finally arrived. Instead, I remember only a heavy door to our left swinging open to reveal, like a scene from an action movie, the silhouette of a man in a blue flight suit, feet planted shoulder-width apart to steady himself as the ship rocked sideways. The cable he’d been lowered on drew back into the ocean spray and fog behind him. “I’m flight surgeon Russ Bowman,” he said and stepped inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Bowman took Jon’s vitals and gave him several, successive shots of morphine. Soon, everyone was working to squeeze him back through the narrow doorway and onto the deck where the helicopter, an MH-60 Jayhawk, was idling overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Until recently, the story I told about the accident unfolded in two basic acts: the tree fell, instantaneously unleashing a kind of unfathomable chaos; then the Coast Guard appeared and, just as swiftly, regathered that chaos into order. It was like watching footage of an exploding object, then watching it run in reverse. The maneuver the Coast Guard was readying to execute now, on the deck of the Mustang, would be the climax of that progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The helicopter hovered 30 or 40 feet over the boat, mirroring its speed and trajectory, while both vehicles moved slowly forward. “Looks like you’re heading for a rain squall,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, radioed the Mustang at one point, and asked the ship to adjust its course, to keep them in as forgiving weather as possible. Soon the flight mechanic was calling out instructions to tuck the aircraft into alignment: “Forward and right 30. Forward and right 20. Forward and right 10.” Then, finally — speaking, in the flight recordings, with an almost galling air of imperturbability — the lead helicopter pilot, Rich McIntyre, radioed the flight mechanic to begin the hoist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The whole procedure, from our vantage point, seemed seamless and routine. In a way, it was: After the agonized deliberation at the air station, the pilots exited off their GPS route into fairly manageable conditions around Inian Pass. The winds were workable; the water wasn’t excessively choppy. Ultimately, scooping Jon off the deck of the Mustang would resemble a standard exercise that the pilots drilled in their trainings. “Not to dumb it down,” the co-pilot, Chris Ferguson, told me — plucking someone with a spinal injury off a moving boat and hoisting them into a moving helicopter is a pretty insane thing to do. “But we normalize what isn’t normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A few moments earlier, as the men scurried around Jon on his backboard, packaging and fastening him for the hoist, Jon worried that the second he got airborne he would start twirling uncontrollably, like the feathery end of a cat toy, and potentially thwack his head on the equipment on deck. But now, he was levitating smoothly — a solitary, swaddled bale of a man, perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Dave and I watched it happen: our friend rising steadily away from us, improbably, to safety. As Jon floated higher, he could hear the Coast Guardsmen on the Mustang beneath him begin to cheer. He felt it was safe to open his eyes. When he did, he saw someone, hunched in the open cargo door of the helicopter, pointing a television camera at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon was rushed&lt;/strong&gt; into surgery at the hospital in Sitka that evening. He’d punctured both lungs, one to the point of collapse, sustained multiple fractures on eight of his ribs, broken several vertebrae, shattered his left shoulder blade and snapped his brachial plexus nerves. His spleen had been macerated into countless flecks. After awakening from surgery, Jon was disappointed that the doctors had swept those shards into a bag and thrown his spleen in the trash; he wanted to get a look at it, maybe even keep it preserved in a jar, alongside his cyborg-banana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Once back in Gustavus, Dave and I realized that we would need to call Jon’s parents in Switzerland. I didn’t have to push the job on Dave this time; he was adamant. He felt he would need to face conversations like these if he was going to be a doctor. It was Jon’s father who picked up, and after absorbing the news, he paused and caught Dave off guard. “Thank you,” he said solemnly. “You guys saved my son’s life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Dave’s stomach dropped. “I remember thinking about it,” he told me recently, “and realizing, Yeah. I guess, logistically, we did.” I had the same reaction when Dave hung up the phone and, clearly shaken, relayed his conversation to me. Until that moment, the idea that we saved Jon’s life had never occurred to us, possibly because the idea that Jon might have died still hadn’t occurred to us. We had zero sense of accomplishment, or even agency. In our minds, all we did was avoid screwing up until the real help could arrive and save him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But Jon hadn’t absorbed the story that way. From the instant he willed himself out of the water, he felt all of us locking into that same seamless flow of order steadily displacing chaos that Dave and I only experienced once the Coast Guard arrived. It was amazing to him how the three of us managed to generate solutions for each successive problem. Even my reciting those poems, which to me had always felt like a moment of utter helplessness, became, in Jon’s telling, a perfect emblem of that streak of serendipitous problem-solving. “You conveyed a calmness,” he told me recently. “I remember it being this nice moment.” He added that if he ever has to spend two hours dying on a remote forest floor again, having me there to recite poetry would be one of his top ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The feeling of inevitability that day became only more pronounced for Jon as time passed and the entire story of our rescue receded into a prologue to the rest of his life. The surgery in Sitka was only the first of half a dozen, and it would take several years for him to regain 60 percent of the use of his arm, wrist and hand, as the nerves gradually regrew along his injured side. He was in good enough shape to go back to Alaska the summer after the accident — repairing boats in the company’s warehouse and occasionally helping out at the bed-and-breakfast — but he struggled. He could repair kayaks but needed help lifting them. He was unable to wrestle the mattress corners into the fitted sheets when he made the beds. After that, he started working at a recording studio in Portland, just as he envisioned while stuck in the water, and he now runs his own audio-mastering company: Spleenless Mastering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Eventually Jon seemed to have recovered from the accident without any conspicuous disabilities. But his life has been quietly corroded by chronic pain and, almost equally, by the stresses of navigating the doctors, medications (and their side effects) to manage it. About two years after the accident, he learned he had PTSD. The trauma wasn’t the falling tree, but his experience of powerlessness as a perpetual patient in the American medical system. It manifested as a kind of unbearable empathy for anyone who was suffering. Jon found himself shouting at doctors, on his own behalf but also on behalf of strangers in waiting rooms who weren’t being seen. He would hear interviews with natural-disaster victims or the homeless on NPR and have to pull his car over. There continued to be other tribulations, too — more mundane ones. A few times a year, he still rebreaks a rib out of nowhere; once or twice, Jon told me, all it has taken is an especially affectionate hug from his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jon found early on that he could cordon off this suffering, both in his own mind and in conversation, by making jokes about the accident itself and sticking to the happy ending of our rescue, a trick that got much easier after the National Geographic show aired later that year. “Mission Rescue: Final Frontier,” the program was called. The soundtrack was all heart-thwacking synth drums and shredding guitar. A foreboding, Ken Burns-effected snapshot of Dave and Jon looking joyful before the trip gave way to a whirring re-enactment of someone else’s legs — cast in the role of Dave’s legs — sprinting through the blurry woods for our radio. A melodramatic narrator pondered the fate of “Kayaker Jon Cohrs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Initially, the schlockiness of the production felt like a blessing. The show depersonalized the accident, giving us all a shorthand to convey how dramatic that day had been, without confronting how destabilizing and senseless it might have felt. At a party, you could lay out the basics — a tree fell on Jon — then say, “National Geographic even made a TV special about it,” and everyone would go wide-eyed but then move on, figuring you would unspool the real story some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But we never realized the degree to which that kitschy shorthand started to obscure the real story — then, gradually, to replace it. I’m embarrassed to admit that, though Jon and I have remained close, I did not know the extent to which he has continued to suffer for the last 17 years until talking to him for several hours in order to write this account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The morning after&lt;/strong&gt; the accident, Dave and I traveled back to Dundas Bay to pack up our campsite and collect the kayaks we abandoned the previous evening. We were shuttled there from Gustavus by the same boat captain who dropped us off three days earlier, a forbiddingly taciturn commercial fisherman named Doug Ogilvy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The tide in the cove was way out when we arrived; it was, as Ogilvy put it, “a suck-ass beach.” The approach was so shallow that he had to drop anchor a hundred yards or more from shore. He asked if we had waders. We did not. So Ogilvy put on his, climbed down the ladder and told Dave to get on his back. Then stoically, like an ox or an old-timey strongman hauling a safe, he trudged through the thigh-high water, dropped Dave on the gravel beach, then lurched back and hauled me the same way, as if I were a man-size infant in a papoose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Dave told me he’d had a strange feeling on the ride out, as if we would discover that an even more massive tree had fallen on our tent since we last slept there and that all three of us would have been crushed and killed if we’d spent another night in Dundas Bay, as planned. That is, he half-expected to find evidence that the accident had been fortuitous somehow, that there was a reason, or redemptive value, behind it. My mother had the same instinct when I called her the night before. On the phone I strained to emphasize for her — she was only two years into her cruelly premature widowhood, and I was new at being the overprotective son of a widow — that Jon was going to be all right, and that Dave and I were safe. She told me that my dad must have been up there looking out for us somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;I resented all the supernatural thinking. If it comforted other people, fine, but I’d somehow known right away that I didn’t need a reason for the accident. It was senseless, but straightforward, as unequivocal a fact as my father’s death had been. A tree fell in the woods. It might not have, but it did. Jon could have died, but he didn’t. Other possibilities spiraled infinitely outward from there, though apparently I wasn’t too interested in contemplating them. As strange as it sounds, it was years before I realized that the tree could have hit me — and only after a friend pointed this out, as I told the story around a fire one night. And it was only a few weeks ago, while on the phone with Jon, that it occurred to me that the tree could have hit all three of us — we were standing in a single-file line, after all, waiting to cross the creek — and that we all might have wound up clobbered and scattered in that river, dying slowly and watching each other die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;It’s also probably true that I helped preclude these possibilities by being so feverishly paranoid about bears, wheeling around at the sound of the snapping roots. That’s what allowed me to see the tree coming, just barely, and scream that infinitesimal heads-up for Dave. And so, the real meaning of the accident, if I felt compelled to find one, might be that it validated my most exaggerated fears. But instead, it somehow helped cleanse me of them. There was comfort for me in accepting the arbitrariness of what happened, in regarding it as a spasm of random damage in time and space that, just as randomly, a small number of human beings got the opportunity to repair. We were more capable than I had understood. We were also far more helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;On the ride back to Gustavus with our gear, I pictured myself, again, as a small blip in empty space. The ride was rough and jumpy as Ogilvy impatiently pounded his boat through the last vestigial wave energy of the storm; Dave and I had to hold on, to plant ourselves on the bench behind him. But there was a moment when I felt so safe that I loosened my grip, leaned slightly into the motion of the boat, and, closing my eyes, felt myself lift off the seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jon Mooallem is a writer at large for the magazine who is working on a book about the great Alaska earthquake of 1964. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/magazine/our-climate-future-is-actually-our-climate-present.html&quot;&gt;His last feature for the magazine was about our climatological future.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A few simple steps to vastly increase your privacy online</title>
<link>https://thetoolsweneed.com/a-few-simple-steps-to-vastly-increase-your-privacy-online/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thetoolsweneed.com/a-few-simple-steps-to-vastly-increase-your-privacy-online/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Online privacy is important for everyone, not just tinfoil hat wearers. First, it's more in line with what a user's expectation is when they browse the internet. Not many people understand all the tracking that happens by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it's more how we operate in real life. You don't have someone following you around from store to store writing down every product you touch or look at, and then block you from entering other stores until you watch an ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the principled view of not giving away valuable data to companies for them to sell is beneficial for everyone. Yes, in some cases you happily give up your data to sites that you enjoy so that they can stay in business. But you can't opt-in to the sites you choose until you put the tools in place to block every site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this post, you'll be leaving much lighter footprints in the internet forest. Certainly more so than your average web surfer. We'll switch up your browser and search engine, add some plugins to block surveillance, and get a little technical with DNS servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry, the faster browsing and smug satisfaction of being a savvy internet user will make up for the discomfort of changing your routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;switch-to-firefox-as-your-browser-on-all-devices&quot;&gt;Switch to Firefox as your browser on all devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a Chrome or Edge hater, I'm just lazy. I don't want to parse whether each new update contains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-login-privacy/&quot;&gt;privacy regression or new settings I need to worry about&lt;/a&gt;. I just want a browser that has more of my best interests in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is developed by a non-profit company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, explicitly dedicated to users' needs. Google and Microsoft make money off of users in different ways and we can never be sure that their business decisions are going to align with what we would want as users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-profit giving away free software makes sense. Some of the biggest companies in the world giving away free software is suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't doubt that the engineers and product people are developing Edge and Chrome for the right reasons, but they are allowed to do so only so far as it is beneficial to the money-making efforts of the company they work for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just really don't want to worry about it. If I have to trust someone, it's going to be Mozilla. Firefox makes it pretty easy to port over your bookmarks and preferences from Chrome as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/switch/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switch from Chrome to Firefox in just a few minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't want to switch, you can still get a lot of benefit from the extensions I mention in the next section, which are all also available for Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-these-browser-extensions&quot;&gt;Install these browser extensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few set-it-and-forget-it browser extensions I use that really only improve my browsing experience and take zero configuration. These are all available for Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (EFF) to stop invisible trackers from following you around the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Also developed by the EFF to enforce encrypted connections with websites whenever possible. Keeps you from accidentally using unencrypted versions of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: A very efficient ad-blocker that will significantly speed up page load times if you aren't using a blocker already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentraleyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: When you load a page, many requests are made to sites other than the one you are visiting. Web developers find it easier to link to tools off-site rather than host those files themselves. This extension checks to see if it can use any of these files from your computer first rather than making the external request. This means faster loading pages and less of a browsing trail for companies to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CanvasBlocker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://browserleaks.com/canvas#how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;Canvas Fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; is a sophisticated technique of identifying your computer across multiple sites. It can tell if you visited site A and site B just by knowing how your browser renders the pages you visit. This extension blocks the APIs in the browser that allow this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smart-referer/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Referer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:  When you browse from google.com to nytimes.com, the nytimes.com request will tell The New York Times' servers that you came from google.com. This is called a referer. This extension removes that piece of information so that nytimes.com doesn't know where you came from. It's kind of a dick move to the sites you like since it removes valuable analytics for them, so you can (and should) whitelist domains that you want to keep sharing data with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-startpage-and-set-it-as-your-default-search-engine&quot;&gt;Use Startpage and set it as your default search engine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be the most important step listed here, since our search history is oddly personal and something I think most people are squeemish about being tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startpage.com/&quot;&gt;Startpage&lt;/a&gt; better than &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; as a Google Search alternative, but both are good. I believe Startpage purchases results from Google, so you get good results without one search being tied to another and then tied back to a personal dossier about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These search engines are still ad-driven, but they are generic ads around your search terms, not targeted to you in any way or aware of your information. It's a straightforward business model that I can trust, so I have no reason to think they are tracking me and lying about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.startpage.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/199/0/how-do-i-add-startpage-to-firefox-as-a-default-search-engine&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Startpage as your default search engine in Firefox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.startpage.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/1010/0/how-do-i-add-startpage-to-chrome&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Startpage as your default search engine in Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;switch-dns-to-1-1-1-1&quot;&gt;Switch DNS to 1.1.1.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're getting a little more technical, but bear with me, you can do this. The first thing your computer does when you try to go to a website, like startpage.com, is it reaches out to a Domain Name Server (DNS) to get the computer-readable address of the page you asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These DNS's have computer-readable addresses themselves, which are four numbers separated by periods, like 8.8.8.8 (Which is Google's DNS). All the ones I'm aware of have the same number repeated four times. The one we're switching to is 1.1.1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, there's a server out there that knows every domain that you try to visit. This is definitely something we want to be secure. Your ISP will usually configure your device to use their own by default when you connect to your Wifi, but that's probably not going to get you what you want in terms of privacy and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you can tell your computer which DNS to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/people/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt; has a publicly accessible DNS at the address &lt;a href=&quot;https://1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt;1.1.1.1&lt;/a&gt; that they claim is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/&quot;&gt;encrypted and secure&lt;/a&gt;. They promise not to sell your browsing history or even log your IP address in order to tie queries to a single person, let alone you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? That's about the best you can ask for with a centralized infrastructure for the internet. A recurring theme in this quest for data ownership and privacy is that you can only take it so far before you have to ultimately trust a company or entity to do what they say they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Cloudflare is more of a trust-based business than most since they need most web operators to believe in their integrity to function. Their response to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-heartbleed-aftermath-all-cloudflare-certificates-revoked-and-reissued/&quot;&gt;Heartbleed vulnerability in 2014&lt;/a&gt; was transparent, swift, and smart. Their public communication has bolstered my trust in them, as well as many other web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of how to set your DNS to 1.1.1.1 is to go into your computer's network settings and add those numbers in the right spot. But here's a few specific tutorials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a different operating system, just search &quot;change dns in XXX&quot; where XXX is your operating system. When it gets to the actual numbers to enter, enter 1.1.1.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to help you through any blockers and I'll update this post as I hear about issues that people are having. Get in touch &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/toolsweneed&quot;&gt;@toolsweneed&lt;/a&gt; or email 'keith' at the domain of this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These steps should not only shrink your personal dossier that companies have on you, but will likely make your browsing much faster due to the DNS upgrade and ad-blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-a-good-netizen&quot;&gt;Be a Good Netizen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to turn off uBlock Origin and Smart Referer for sites that you value, as those likely provide valuable revenue and analytics for them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amsterdam&amp;#039;s Plan: If You Buy a Newly Built House, You Can&amp;#039;t Rent It Out</title>
<link>https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/03/amsterdam-rental-housing-prices-new-home-owner-occupied/585235/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/03/amsterdam-rental-housing-prices-new-home-owner-occupied/585235/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy a new house in Amsterdam, you’ll have to actually live in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the message from the Dutch capital as it prepares &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amsterdam.nl/actueel/nieuws/plan-verhuurverbod/?utm_source=Banner%20Nieuws&amp;amp;utm_medium=website&amp;amp;utm_term=Verhuurverbod%20op%20nieuwbouw%20koopwoningen&amp;amp;utm_content=Verhuurverbod%20op%20nieuwbouw%20koopwoningen&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Banner%201&quot;&gt;a new proposal&lt;/a&gt; to restrict sales of newly built housing to owner-occupiers, blocking out anyone who wants to buy the properties only to rent them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan, which is expected to be adopted into law without any great hitch this autumn, remains at proposal stage for now: It’s not yet been clarified, for example, how long an owner would have to occupy their home before being able to rent it out. It is nonetheless part of a clear push in Amsterdam to improve housing options for a group that increasingly struggles to secure affordable housing: the squeezed middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons why this group is facing problems—ones that have a knock-on effect all the way through the housing chain—may sound familiar. The Netherlands has relatively high home-ownership rates, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=BOOKMARK_DS-057102_QID_684D63DF_UID_-3F171EB0&amp;amp;layout=TIME,C,X,0;GEO,L,Y,0;INCGRP,L,Z,0;HHTYP,L,Z,1;TENURE,L,Z,2;INDICATORS,C,Z,3;&amp;amp;zSelection=DS-057102INDICATORS,OBS_FLAG;DS-057102INCGRP,TOTAL;DS-057102TENURE,OWN;DS-057102HHTYP,TOTAL;&amp;amp;rankName1=HHTYP_1_2_-1_2&amp;amp;rankName2=INDICATORS_1_2_-1_2&amp;amp;rankName3=INCGRP_1_2_-1_2&amp;amp;rankName4=TENURE_1_2_-1_2&amp;amp;rankName5=TIME_1_0_0_0&amp;amp;rankName6=GEO_1_2_0_1&amp;amp;sortR=ASC_0&amp;amp;sortC=ASC_-1_FIRST&amp;amp;rStp=&amp;amp;cStp=&amp;amp;rDCh=&amp;amp;cDCh=&amp;amp;rDM=true&amp;amp;cDM=true&amp;amp;footnes=false&amp;amp;empty=false&amp;amp;wai=false&amp;amp;time_mode=NONE&amp;amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;amp;lang=EN&amp;amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2C%23%23%23.%23%23%23&quot;&gt;67 percent of the Dutch population&lt;/a&gt; living in owner-occupied housing as of 2014. Middle-income households that would have formerly expected to buy, however, are increasingly finding themselves priced out of the market, substantially by investors who then place the property on the rental market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges of investor-dominated rental markets is hardly limited to Amsterdam, and there’s a growing determination across Europe to show a tougher, more heavily regulated approach to large-scale housing investors. Barcelona, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/03/barcelona-affordable-housing-spain-apartment-rental-fines/584902/&quot;&gt;is imposing massive fines&lt;/a&gt; for landlords who leave properties empty, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/02/berlin-germany-housing-rent-how-much-price-landlord-policies/582898/&quot;&gt;Berlin plans&lt;/a&gt; to start renationalizing private housing after investors scooped up much of its rental housing in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rental units do, of course, provide somebody with a home, though it’s often on far less secure terms than ownership. As more units have become rental housing, many in Amsterdam’s middle class find they could have purchased a home if the market looked like it did a decade or so ago, but its changes mean they remain stuck renting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam’s proposed laws wouldn’t stop new rental housing from being built—according to the city’s proposal, that housing would simply have to be proposed and approved as rental property in the first place. On its own, the measure isn’t a fix for a malfunctioning housing market, but it should serve to reduce a certain amount of pressure at the upper end of the rental market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam has been working on ways to tackle this issue for a while. In a general plan adopted in 2017, it laid down the guideline that 40 percent of all new homes should be some form of public housing, while a further 40 percent should be for middle-income households, defined as households with an income between €38,000 and €60,000 ($43,000 to $68,000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, the city announced that it plans to go further by placing a cap on the cost of new homes that are built for this middle tier. Maximum prices would be capped between €175,000 and €297,000 ($198,000 and $262,000) depending on size and location. This cap isn’t so low as to make homebuilding unprofitable; the maximum is just below the current &lt;a href=&quot;https://nltimes.nl/2019/02/26/average-selling-price-dutch-homes-surpass-eu300000-first-time&quot;&gt;average Dutch home price&lt;/a&gt; of around €302,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new limits placed on housing may be broadly friendly to both tenants and owner-occupiers, but this group is not getting away without tighter regulation itself. According to reports this winter in the Dutch media, between 10 and 20 percent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraaf.nl/financieel/3247841/amsterdam-ongekend-hard-tegen-onderverhuur-sociaal-huurhuis?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic&quot;&gt;Amsterdam’s rent-controlled apartments&lt;/a&gt; are illegally sublet at some point, either to permanent tenants or as short-term vacation rentals. There’s apparently little pushback from the housing associations that control these tenancies. The national government wants to clamp down on this abuse by upping the potential fine incurred, from a current (and largely unenforced) €20,000 to up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/03/minister-gets-tough-on-illegal-subletting-and-holiday-rentals/&quot;&gt;€83,000&lt;/a&gt; ($94,000), creating a deterrent actually large enough to stop people gaming the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will these measures be enough to help Amsterdam create a stable, sustainable housing market? Almost certainly not, but they could be a step on the way there. They will at the least make sure that existing measures to make the city’s housing more affordable are far more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considered alongside the housing actions in other European cities, two facts emerge: That the scope of Europe’s urban housing squeeze extends far beyond people on low incomes, and that as more people struggle to find affordable accommodations, cities’ mandate to intervene and regulate the market is likely to grow ever stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>LHCb discovers matter-antimatter asymmetry in charm quarks</title>
<link>https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/lhcb-discovers-matter-antimatter-asymmetry-in-charm-quarks</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/lhcb-discovers-matter-antimatter-asymmetry-in-charm-quarks</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists on the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN have discovered a new way in which matter and antimatter behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 99.9999 percent statistical certainty, LHCb scientists have observed a difference between the decays of matter and antimatter particles containing charm quarks. This discovery opens up a new realm to study the differences between matter and antimatter and could help explain why we live in a matter-dominated universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a major breakthrough in experimental physics,” says Sheldon Stone, a professor at Syracuse University and collaborator on the LHCb experiment. “There’s been many attempts to make this measurement, but until now, no one had ever seen it. It’s a huge milestone in antimatter research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every structure in the universe—from the tiniest speck of dust to the mightiest star—is built from matter. But there is an equally qualified material for the job: antimatter. Antimatter is nearly identical to matter, except that its charge and magnetic properties are reversed. Precision studies of antihydrogen atoms, for example, have shown that their characteristics are identical to hydrogen atoms to beyond the billionth decimal place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matter and antimatter cannot coexist in the same physical space because if they come into contact, they annihilate each other. This equal-but-opposite nature of matter and antimatter poses a conundrum for cosmologists, who theorize that the same amount of matter and antimatter should have exploded into existence during the birth of our universe. But if that’s true, all of that matter and antimatter should have annihilated one another, leaving nothing but energy behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particle physicists are looking for any tiny differences between matter and antimatter which could help explain why matter won out over antimatter in the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for them, antimatter is not a totally extinct species. “We don’t usually see antimatter in our world,” says Ivan Polyakov, a postdoc at Syracuse University and internal LHCb reviewer for this new analysis. “But it can be produced when ordinary matter particles are smashed together at high energies, such as they do inside the Large Hadron Collider.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main way scientists study the tiny and rare particles produced during the LHC’s collisions is by mapping how they decay and transform into more-stable byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This gives us a sort of family lineage for our ­particle of interest,” says Cesar da Silva, a scientist  from Los Alamos National Lab and also a LHCb collaborator. “Once stable particles are measured by the detector, we can trace their ancestors to find the primordial generation of particles in the collision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of quantum mechanics, we cannot predict what each single unstable particle will decay into, but we can figure out the probabilities for each possible outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cds.cern.ch/record/2668357/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new LHCb study&lt;/a&gt; looked at the decays of particles consisting of two bound quarks—the internal structural components of particles like protons and neutrons. One version of this particle (called D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; by scientists) contained a charm quark and the antimatter version of the up quark, called an anti-up quark. The other version contained the reverse, an up quark and an anti-charm quark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists on the LHCb experiment identified tens of millions of both D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and anti-D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; particles and counted how many times each transformed into one set of byproducts (a pair of particles called pions) versus another possible set (a pair of particles called kaons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything else being equal, the ratio of these two possible outcomes should have been identical for both D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and anti-D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; particles. But scientists found that the two ratios differed by about a tenth of a percent—evidence that these charmed matter and antimatter particles are not totally interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They might look nearly identical from the outside, but they behave differently,” Polyakov says. “This is the puzzle of antimatter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that matter and antimatter particles behave slightly differently is not new and has been observed previously in studies of particles containing strange quarks and bottom quarks. What makes this study unique is that it is the first time this asymmetry has been observed in particles containing charm quarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous experiments—including BaBar, Belle and CDF—endeavored to make this same measurement but fell short of collecting enough data to to tease out such a subtle effect. The huge amount of data generated since the start of LHC Run 2 combined with the introduction of more advanced methods to tag the particles of interest enabled scientists to collect enough matter and antimatter D&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; particles to finally see these decay differences beyond a shadow of a doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to see how this measurement fits with the theoretical models, which are still a little fuzzy on this prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Theorists will need to figure out if the Standard Model can explain this,” Stone says. “We’re pushing our field and this result will certainly be in the history books.”&lt;/p&gt;
