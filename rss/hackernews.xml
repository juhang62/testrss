<description>&lt;p&gt;Advertising as a major source of human dissatisfaction: Cross-national evidence on one million Europeans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;362&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising is ubiquitous. In recent decades, the volume of advertising has been growing dramatically. Therefore, it is natural to ask if this harms our wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not perfectly understand the link between advertising and individual wellbeing. It is reasonable to assume that it might operate through two broad channels that have opposing effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive: advertising informs&lt;/strong&gt;. It may promote human welfare by allowing people to make better choices about products. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative: advertising stimulates desires that are not feasible&lt;/strong&gt;. This creates dissatisfaction. Hence, advertising might reduce welfare by unduly raising consumption aspirations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the national level, we do not know which of the two effects is dominant. Many national variables influence wellbeing, in particular the generosity of the welfare state and variables such as unemployment (DiTella et al. 2001, DiTella et al. 2003, and Radcliff 2013). But recent research on subjective wellbeing, described in sources such as Easterlin (2003), Oswald (1997), Layard (2005) and Clark (2018), has paid little attention to the role of advertising, and so there are no cross-country econometric studies of the effect of advertising using representative samples of adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping up with the Joneses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, is a reasonable hypothesis that advertising has a negative effect on wellbeing. Easterlin (1974) found early evidence suggesting that society does not become happier as it grows richer. He suggested that one mechanism might be that individuals compare themselves with their neighbours. Easterlin’s thesis, in part, assumes that we desire conspicuous consumption (Veblen 1899, 1904). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If individuals have ‘relativistic’ preferences, so that they look at others before deciding how satisfied they feel, then when they consume more goods, they fail to become happier because they see others also consuming more. The pleasure of my new car is taken away if Ms Jones, in the parking spot next to mine, has also just bought one. More recent evidence on ‘comparison effects’ has been reviewed by Clark (2018). Mujcic and Oswald (2018) also find longitudinal evidence of negative wellbeing consequences based on envy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Veblen, many researchers have worried about negative effects on wellbeing of advertising. In some cases they have found small-scale evidence (examples include Richins 1995, Easterlin and Crimmins 1991, Bagwell and Bernheim 1996, Sirgy et al. 1998, Dittmar et al. 2014, Frey et al. 2007, and Harris et al. 2009). Research has focused on the likely detrimental effects upon children (Andreyeva et al. 2011, Borzekowski and Robinson 2001, Buijzen and Valkenburg 2003a, Opree et al. 2013, and Buijzen and Valkenburg 2003b), although the most recent work, by Opree et al. (2016), produced inconclusive results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evidence of a negative effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found evidence of negative links between national advertising and national wellbeing (Michel et al. 2019). Using longitudinal information on countries, from pooled cross-sectional surveys, we find that rises and falls in advertising are followed, a few years later, by falls and rises in national life-satisfaction, giving an inverse connection between advertising levels and the later wellbeing levels of nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a sample of slightly over 900,000 randomly sampled European citizens in 27 countries, surveyed annually from 1980 to 2011. Respondents reported their level of life satisfaction and many other aspects of themselves and their lives. We also recorded total advertising expenditure levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 illustrates the study’s key idea. It divides the data into tertiles and then plots the (uncorrected) relationship between the change in advertising and the change in life satisfaction. The three vertical bars separate the data into countries that had particularly large increases in advertising expenditure, moderate increases, and small increases. Figure 1 shows that the greater the rise in advertising within a nation, the smaller the later improvement in life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt; The inverse longitudinal relationship between changes in advertising and changes in the life satisfaction of countries, 1980 to 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMay2014/proto27mayfig1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt;: Based on a sample of approximately 1 million individuals. Based on shorter period if data not available for that country. Bottom Tertile consists of Czech Republic, Germany after 1989, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia. Mean change 2.93. Middle Tertile consists of Bulgaria, Western Germany (before 1989), Denmark, UK, Sweden, Slovenia, Netherlands, Turkey, Spain. Mean Change: 2.15. Top tertile consists of Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Croatia, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal. Mean change 1.46.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising does not have a spurious association with life satisfaction that is attributable merely to the business cycle. Using standard regression analysis, we were able to show that the negative effect of advertisement on life satisfaction is not due to the correlation of both variables with the GDP. This negative effect is robust to the inclusion of other variables like country and year fixed effects, unemployment, and individual socioeconomic characteristics that are typically included in any happiness equation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect implies that a hypothetical doubling of advertising expenditure would result in a 3% drop in life satisfaction. That is approximately one half the absolute size of the marriage effect on life satisfaction, or approximately one quarter of the absolute size of the effect of being unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are consistent with concerns that were first more than a century ago, and regularly since (Veblen 1904 and Robinson 1933, for example). They are consistent with Easterlin (1974, 2003) and Layard (1980). They may also be consistent with ideas about the negative consequences of materialism (Sirgy et al. 2012, Burroughs and Rindfleisch 2002, Speck and Roy 2008, and Snyder and Debono 1985). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is evidence of an inverse longitudinal relationship between national advertising and national dissatisfaction, we still need to uncover the causal mechanism. But this demands investigation, because the size of the estimated effect here is both substantial and statistically well-determined. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scene report from the Chernobyl Zone</title>
<link>https://moxie.org/stories/chernobyl-scene-report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://moxie.org/stories/chernobyl-scene-report/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Surreptitiously crossing the Uzh river at 2am, with the full moon starting to set low on the horizon, the first thing that strikes you about the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is the sound of it. Just two hours outside of Kiev, all the sounds of civilization disappear, and only our radiation dosimeters are left ticking softly with the wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But moving into the zone on the other side of the river, it's not silence we're met with. Even in the darkness, it's immediately clear that the forest has retaken the Chernobyl Zone, and the forest is &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt;. It's a reverberating symphony of birds, frogs, crickets, cicadas — even wolves howling in the distance. Navigating hesitantly through those first few kilometers, we moved as silently and nimbly as we could, in quiet awe to the sounds of life and the expanse of the moonlit trees around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, with the shock of a sound that doesn't belong, &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAM-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; a 6-liter bottle of water fell off the back of Geoff's bicycle, exploding when it hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three of us had decided to try to explore the zone by bicycle. Even after 30 years and an intensive 10-year remediation effort, it's a contaminated landscape. It's dangerous to consume anything from within the zone, since it could contain Strontium-90, which your body can mistake for calcium and absorb into your bones, eventually causing bone cancer. That meant we would have to carry in all the food and water we'd need for the duration of our trip. Hiking with food isn't so bad, but water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We considered a number of options. Could we just carry it? No, we'd need at least 5 gallons each, which would mean 180lbs for the three of us. There was no way we'd make it 80 kilometers with that. Maybe a hand truck, or a wagon? Eventually we settled on bicycles, figuring that even if the terrain didn't always allow us to ride, we'd at least be able to push them with the water strapped to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 minutes in, we were down 6 liters. We spent some time re-securing everything, all of us keen to avoid a situation where we'd have to make a choice between dehydration and drinking radioactive water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our immediate destination was the city of Pripyat. When the V.I. Lenin Nuclear Power Station was built, the closest major town was Chernobyl (14km away), which is how people came to refer to the plant. But a new city of 50,000 called Pripyat was built simultaneously with the plant to both house workers and serve as a utopian model for future Soviet development. This ghost city was our first destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't know exactly what to expect for the trip, or if it would work at all. We had Google Maps satellite imagery, a rough idea of where the military checkpoints were, and a $5 compass. In the end, the easiest thing to do was just follow the old power lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 40km from the edge of the zone to Pripyat, and we wanted to be there before 7am, which is when we surmised that security would become more of an issue. We spent the night tiptoing around razor wire, coasting silently through sleeping checkpoints, and riding frantically through the dark from some surprisingly alert and vigilant guard dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly, we just gasped at the beauty and wonder of our surroundings. Watching an enormous buck with towering antlers cross through the twilight in front of us, it felt more like we were in some remote part of Alaska, but superimposed onto the rusting hammers and sickles of forgotten Soviet infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a much longer and much harder ride than we expected. The sun came up at 4am, and we rode on through the early hours, pushing to reach Pripyat on time. Once or twice we considered ducking off in little abandoned villages we'd come across in order to wait out the day, but the radiation levels were always too high in the structures we found. So we kept riding, passing old rail yards, forgotten communist monuments, and rusting machinery. When we eventually found ourselves in the city, the lack of transition was surreal. As we were riding through the forest, willing ourselves to keep a steady pace after an all-night journey, we suddenly became aware that there were already 7-story apartment buildings looming up all around us, just behind the first few rows of trees. Block after block after block of giant imponderable buildings, all standing silently within the surrounding woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted, we picked an apartment building at random and went in. Our initial thought was to camp on the roof, but the radiation on the roof's surface was over 50 μSv/hr, so we moved to apartment #23 instead. The radiation there was only 0.08 μSv/hr (actually lower than our apartment in California). The former occupants must have had their windows closed when the explosion occurred. We collapsed and slept for most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-permalink=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BxzxyBche1R/&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;12&quot; readability=&quot;-10.616071428571&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reactor No 4 exploded, there was a lot of initial confusion about the magnitude of the accident. For a number of reasons, it was a full 36 hours before authorities realized that four days in Pripyat would result in a lethal dose for its occupants, and finally ordered the evacuation. Residents were given 2 hours to pack whatever they could carry and get on a bus. Most were under the impression that they would be returning within 3 or 4 days, but they were never allowed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the newspapers and books scattered about apartment #23, the packed suitcases sitting where they were left, the clothes pins still sitting on the same clothes lines where they must have been 33 years ago, you can feel the abruptness of the city's end. This wasn't a ghost town that slowly petered out over decades until there was nobody left, it was a densely constructed city of 50 thousand where everyone left at the exact same moment, and nobody ever came back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our time in Pripyat was vivid. We'd have to hide and move cautiously during the day, but at night! The night was ours. We wandered around the rooftops, through the squares of the city, and into as many buildings as we could — each one more stunning than the one before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the stadium, which underscores the vibe of the entire place: where the crumbling empty stands should look out onto the pitch, there is only forest. Standing in the bleachers, listening to the Pripyat municipal overture of resounding bird song, the only thing we could do was stare out at the trees and wonder &quot;how long until New York looks like this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over six hundred thousand people were directly involved in dealing with the aftermath of the Chernobyl explosion. The early days were filled with incredible sacrifice. Immediately after the accident, one of the first priorities was to put out the burning nuclear material that was sending a radioactive steam cloud billowing into the sky. Without a way to approach the reactor directly, they flew helicopter sorties over it with crews inside who &lt;em&gt;threw bags of sand out the doors&lt;/em&gt; and into the crater, slowly filling it. When the sand started to melt, they did the same thing with lead. Some pilots flew up to 33 sorties into the steam cloud, and &lt;em&gt;six hundred helicopter pilots were killed&lt;/em&gt; by the radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that material then started to smolder downwards out through the floor of the chamber, it threatened to come into contact with a large amount of water that had pooled there as a result of early firefighter attempts to put it out with hoses. This would have ignited a second reaction that would have been the equivalent of a 5 megaton explosion. It would have leveled Kiev and Minsk, and would have ejected the nuclear material from the other 3 Chernobyl reactors with a force that would have rendered much of Europe uninhabitable for hundreds of years. With only days to stop it, Alexei Ananenko, Valeri Bezpalov, and Boris Baranov went into the ruins of the plant, knowingly facing almost certain death from that level of radiation exposure, to release valves that would drain 5 million gallons of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the same radioactive magma threatened to melt through the concrete pad below that and into the groundwater for 50 million people, miners dug a 150 meter tunnel 12ft under ground &lt;em&gt;by hand&lt;/em&gt; to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the firefighters from the first night, before they understood that this was not just a fire, showed up at the hospital sick and suffering from radiation burns, the medical staff there knew that they must have been severely contaminated, but they stayed and treated them anyway, potentially exposing themselves to the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every interview I've seen or account that I've read from those involved, most of whom died within weeks or have suffered life-long health problems, has a common theme of no regrets; the sentiment almost universally &quot;It had to be done. Who would I expect to do it instead of me?&quot; &lt;img src=&quot;https://moxie.org/stories/chernobyl-scene-report/theobject.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Object&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The New Safe Confinment, also known as 'The Object'. This cost $1.8 billion to construct, $60 million a year to maintain, and is rated for 100 years. The financial costs of the accident appear to be never ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's so much in Pripyat that by the time we had to leave, we had probably explored less than 1% of the city. We went out on the same road that the residents did 33 years ago. Riding across the zone under the full moon, we'd stop sometimes and stare out at the woods and fields around us, all alone in the middle of that huge seeming expanse. The experience is full of tensions. It is so beautiful and so peaceful that it really feels like paradise, but it's a paradise that you can't enjoy. You have to be careful about where you sit, what you eat, how you eat it, what you touch; which is — ironically — why it exists. The reason it's so beautiful and so peaceful is precisely because we can't consume it. Like, perhaps, all real paradises everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally left the zone and made it back to Kiev, I was largely struck by how normal everything is there — there's almost no sign that the apocalypse is only 2hrs away. No physical signs at all, in fact. Around town there are statues of former princes, religious monuments, a memorial to the veterans of the Afghanistan war. On the bills of the currency, the faces of 10th century princes, politicians, poets, and writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What of the helicopter pilots who killed themselves to put out the most toxic fire in history? What about the people who knowingly sacrificed themselves to stop a reaction that would have destroyed most of Europe? Who were the miners that dug the tunnel through radioactive ground to save the water supply for 50 million people? They have no public monuments, we do not know their faces, their names are not etched onto the buildings that are still standing because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know all of their names, but I'm thinking of them here, in this place, amongst the living.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Simple Dockerfile examples are often broken by default</title>
<link>https://pythonspeed.com/articles/dockerizing-python-is-hard/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pythonspeed.com/articles/dockerizing-python-is-hard/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When it’s time to package up your Python application into a Docker image, the natural thing to do is search the web for some examples. And a quick search will provide you with plenty of simple, easy examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these simple, easy examples are often broken in a variety of ways, some obvious, some less so. To demonstrate just some of the ways they’re broken, I’m going to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with an example &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; that comes up fairly high on some Google searches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how it’s broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give some suggestions on how to make it less broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Outside the specific topic under discussion, the Dockerfiles in this article are not examples of best practices, since the added complexity would obscure the main point of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonspeed.com/products/pythoncontainer/&quot;&gt;best-practices Docker images for Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broken by default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;, which I found by searching for Python Dockerization examples. I’ve made some minor changes to disguise its origin, but otherwise it is the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot; data-lang=&quot;dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# DO NOT USE THIS DOCKERFILE AS AN EXAMPLE, IT IS BROKEN&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; python:3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; yourscript.py /&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;pip &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;flask

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; [ &quot;python&quot;, &quot;./yourscript.py&quot; ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the problems with this Dockerfile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many different problems can you spot in this image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem #1: Non-reproducible builds re Python version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice is that this &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; is based off of the &lt;code&gt;python:3&lt;/code&gt; image. At the time of writing this will install Python 3.7, but at some point it will switch to installing Python 3.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point rebuilding the image will switch to a different version of Python, which might break the software: a minor change in your code can lead to a deploy that breaks production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;code&gt;python:3.7&lt;/code&gt; as the base image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem #2: Non-reproducible builds re dependencies.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;code&gt;flask&lt;/code&gt; is installed with no versioning, so each time the image is rebuilt potentially a new version of &lt;code&gt;flask&lt;/code&gt; (or one of its dependencies, or one of its dependencies’ dependencies) will change. If they’re compatible, great, but there’s no guarantee that is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Create &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; with transitively-pinned versions of all dependencies, e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hynek.me/articles/python-app-deps-2018/&quot;&gt;by using &lt;code&gt;pip-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem #3: Changes to source code invalidate the build cache&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want fast builds, you want to rely on Docker’s layer caching. But by copying in the file before running &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt;, all later layers are invalidated—this image will be rebuilt from scratch every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; Copy in files only when they’re first needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem #4: Running as root, which is insecure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default Docker containers run as root, &lt;a href=&quot;http://canihaznonprivilegedcontainers.info/&quot;&gt;which is a security risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s much better to run as a non-root user, and do so in the image itself so that you don’t listen on ports&amp;lt;1024 or do other operations that require a subset of root’s permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A somewhat better image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a somewhat better—though still not ideal—Dockerfile that addresses the issues above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot; data-lang=&quot;dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; python:3.7&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; requirements.txt /tmp/&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;pip &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-r&lt;/span&gt; /tmp/requirements.txt

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;RUN &lt;/span&gt;useradd &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--create-home&lt;/span&gt; appuser
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WORKDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; /home/appuser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; appuser&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; yourscript.py .&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt; [ &quot;python&quot;, &quot;./yourscript.py&quot; ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the resulting image was something you’d want to run in production—and it almost certainly isn’t!—the image is still insufficient on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you also need to regularly update &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; in a controlled manner, in order to get security updates and bug fixes, and you’ll need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-cache-insecure-images/&quot;&gt;regularly rebuild your images without caching to get security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are many more improvements you could make to get this closer to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonspeed.com/products/pythoncontainer/&quot;&gt;production-ready Python container&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be careful what you learn from&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A broken Docker image can lead to production outages, and building best-practices images is a lot harder than it seems.&lt;/strong&gt; So don’t just copy the first example you find on the web: do your research, and spend some time reading about best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, I recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/&quot;&gt;official Dockerfile&lt;/a&gt; best practices documentation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hynek.me/articles/&quot;&gt;Hynek’s articles&lt;/a&gt;, and of course the various articles on this site about &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonspeed.com/articles/#docker&quot;&gt;Docker packaging for Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Update on await syntax in Rust</title>
<link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/await-decision-ii/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/await-decision-ii/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/await-decision/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I said that the lang team would be making our final decision about the syntax of the await operator in the May 23 meeting. That was last Thursday, and we did reach a decision. In brief, we decided to go forward with the preliminary proposal I outlined earlier: a postfix dot syntax, &lt;code&gt;future.await&lt;/code&gt;. For more background, in addition the previous post on my blog, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Await-Syntax-Write-Up-t9NlOSeI4RQ8AINsaSSyJ&quot;&gt;this write up about some of the trade offs from April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things I want to make clear about this proposal and about our design process in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there a very few absolutes in the design of the Rust language. There are a few things we &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do (or &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do) - our type system must be sound, for example. But the vast majority of questions are questions of &lt;em&gt;trade offs&lt;/em&gt; - weighing the pros and cons of different proposals to find the path forward we believe is most preferable. Often, there is a choice that is clearly superior to just about everyone. But sometimes all of the proposals have different positive and negative attributes, and the way each of us weighs those attributes is different, leading to conflicting opinions. This was certainly one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen in these discussions costs that people weigh heavily raised to the level of absolutes. This negative attribute of some proposal is held to be so bad that we simply &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do that. For the most part, this is an unhelpful framing. It closes the discussion because it makes it difficult for people who disagree to acknowledge that this problem is real while also arguing that we should hold a different balance of the cost, which makes it still the preferable choice. We need to be able to avoid this sort of dichotomizing, black and white thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as an additional addendum to this idea, each member of the language team weighs these costs differently. Individually, several of us might have made a different selection than the syntax we have chosen here. I know that the way I weigh the costs personally, it is not my most preferred proposal. But we are all united in the desire to move forward with providing the feature that users need and the understanding that several of these proposals are viable. This decision has been justified well and reflects the “consensus weighting” of the different costs among the members of the language team. If you weighted these costs such that you would have made a different choice, I would like to imagine that you can also embrace these values and feel glad that we are moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few further clarifications regarding some conversations that have arisen in the discussion the last few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Dot keyword:”&lt;/strong&gt; In the previous post, a sketch was made of an idea in which certain keywords could be postfixed or infixed using the dot operator. This idea is only a sketch, and is not implied or guaranteed by the decision we’ve made here. While this operator might provide some additional motivation for that proposal, it will still need to go through its own RFC process, and has its own clear drawbacks that users have already identified that will need to be weighed separately from this decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigil syntaxes:&lt;/strong&gt; In the previous summary, sigil syntaxes like &lt;code&gt;@await&lt;/code&gt; were only very briefly addressed. I want to be clear that this is once again a question of weighing costs. The costs of introducing a new sigil with meaning in the language are real: we only have so many sigils available (non-ASCII sigils are not considered viable from an input accessibility perspective), each new sigil increases the surface area that users need to learn, using overmany sigils is considered aesthetically unpleasant by many people. Comparing the costs of using a new sigil to the costs of reusing the already overloaded &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; operator, we felt that using &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; was less costly. Some users may disagree, but I hope you can understand that this isn’t a black and white question, but a comparison of options each with their own pros and cons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m working actively on drafting a stabilization report to propose stabilizing a minimum viable version of async/await in the 1.37 release of Rust. 1.37 will be released in mid-August, and branches on July 4. That means we have about a month to make sure the implementation, documentation, and design are all in a sufficient state to stabilize the minimum version of this feature. That won’t be the end of the async/await feature - there will be a lot of extensions left out of the minimum feature - but it will be an important milestone for everyone who wants to use Rust for high performance network services.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Now Forces Edge Preview Users to Use Chrome for the Modern YouTube</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-207372&quot; src=&quot;https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge.jpg 1280w, https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge-310x175.jpg 310w, https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/youtubeedge-600x338.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thurrott.com/microsoft/204539/microsofts-new-chromium-based-edge-browser-is-finally-here&quot;&gt;testing a new Microsoft Edge browser&lt;/a&gt; based on Chromium a little while ago. The company has been releasing new canary and dev builds for the browser over the last few weeks, and the preview is actually really great. In fact, I have been using the new Microsoft Edge Canary on my main Windows machine and my MacBook Pro for more than a month, and it’s really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you watch YouTube quite a lot, you will face a new problem on the new Edge. It turns out, Google has randomly disabled the modern YouTube experience for users of the new Microsoft Edge. Users are now redirected to the old YouTube experience, which lacks the modern design as well as the dark theme for YouTube, as first &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gus33000/status/1133327800809807872&quot;&gt;spotted by Gustave Monce&lt;/a&gt;. And when you try to manually access the new YouTube from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/new&quot;&gt;youtube.com/new,&lt;/a&gt; YouTube simply asks users to download Google Chrome, stating that the Edge browser isn’t supported. Ironically, the same page states “We support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change affects the latest versions of Microsoft Edge Canary and Dev channels. It is worth noting that the classic Microsoft Edge based on EdgeHTML continues to work fine with the modern YouTube experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird thing here is that Microsoft has been working &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/205701/google-gives-a-thumbs-up-to-chromium-based-microsoft-edge&quot;&gt;closely with Google engineers&lt;/a&gt; on the new Edge and Chromium. Both the companies engineers are working closely to improve Chromium and introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/205026/living-on-the-new-edge-whats-missing&quot;&gt;new features like ARM64&lt;/a&gt; support to Chromium. So it’s very odd that Google would prevent users of the new Microsoft Edge browser from using the modern YouTube experience. This is most likely an error on Google’s part, but it could be intentional, too — we really don’t know for now.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;28 May 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iea.org/media/news/2019/190527NuclearReport.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;472&quot;/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A new IEA report finds nuclear power capacity in advanced economies could fall sharply, making the global energy transition harder and more costly.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;nav class=&quot;share&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=IEA&amp;amp;text=%5BTITLE%5D&amp;amp;url=%5BURL%5D&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iea.org/media/ieawebsite/contentassets/share/twitter.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;amp;title=%5BTITLE%5D&amp;amp;url=%5BURL%5D&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iea.org/media/ieawebsite/contentassets/share/linkedin.svg&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=%5BTITLE%5D&amp;amp;u=%5BURL%5D&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iea.org/media/ieawebsite/contentassets/share/facebook.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:?subject=%5BTITLE%5D&amp;amp;body=%5BURL%5D&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iea.org/media/ieawebsite/contentassets/share/envelope.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Email&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:window.print()&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iea.org/media/ieawebsite/contentassets/share/print.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Print&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER – With nuclear power facing an uncertain future in many countries, the world risks a steep decline in its use in advanced economies that could result in billions of tonnes of additional carbon emissions, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/publications/nuclear&quot;&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; by the International Energy Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear is the second-largest low-carbon power source in the world today, accounting for 10% of global electricity generation. It is second only to hydropower at 16%. For advanced economies – including the United States, Canada, the European Union and Japan – nuclear has been the biggest low-carbon source of electricity for more than 30 years and remains so today. It plays an important role in electricity security in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the future of nuclear power is uncertain as ageing plants are beginning to close in advanced economies, partly because of policies to phase them out but also as a result of economic and regulatory factors. Without policy changes, advanced economies could lose 25% of their nuclear capacity by 2025 and as much as two-thirds of it by 2040, according to the new report, &lt;em&gt;Nuclear Power in a Clean Energy System&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of further lifetime extensions of existing nuclear plants and new projects could result in an additional 4 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some countries have opted out of nuclear power in light of concerns about safety and other issues. Many others, however, still see a role for nuclear in their energy transitions but are not doing enough to meet their goals, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its mission to cover all fuels and technologies, the IEA hopes that the publication of its first report addressing nuclear power in nearly two decades will help bring the topic back into the global energy debate. The report is being released during the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Clean Energy Ministerial in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without an important contribution from nuclear power, the global energy transition will be that much harder,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s Executive Director. “Alongside renewables, energy efficiency and other innovative technologies, nuclear can make a significant contribution to achieving sustainable energy goals and enhancing energy security. But unless the barriers it faces are overcome, its role will soon be on a steep decline worldwide, particularly in the United States, Europe and Japan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new report finds that extending the operational life of existing nuclear plants requires substantial capital investment. But its cost is competitive with other electricity generation technologies, including new solar and wind projects, and can lead to a more secure, less disruptive energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market conditions remain unfavourable, however, for lengthening the lifetimes of nuclear plants. An extended period of low wholesale electricity prices in most advanced economies has sharply reduced or eliminated profit margins for many technologies, putting nuclear plants at risk of shutting down early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, for example, some 90 reactors have 60-year operating licenses, yet several have already retired early and many more are at risk. In Europe, Japan and other advanced economies, extensions of plants’ lifetimes also face uncertain prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment in new nuclear projects in advanced economies is even more difficult. New projects planned in Finland, France and the United States are not yet in service and have faced major cost overruns. Korea has been an important exception, with a record of completing construction of new projects on time and on budget, though government policy aims to end new nuclear construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sharp decline in nuclear power capacity in advanced economies would have major implications. Without additional lifetime extensions and new builds, achieving key sustainable energy goals, including international climate targets, would become more difficult and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other low-carbon sources, namely wind and solar PV, are to fill the shortfall in nuclear, their deployment would have to accelerate to an unprecedented level. In the past 20 years, wind and solar PV capacity has increased by about 580 gigawatts in advanced economies. But over the next 20 years, nearly five times that amount would need to be added. Such a drastic increase in renewable power generation would create serious challenges in integrating the new sources into the broader energy system. Clean energy transitions in advanced economies would also require $1.6 trillion in additional investment over the same period, which would end up hurting consumers through higher electricity bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Policy makers hold the key to nuclear power’s future,” Dr Birol said. “Electricity market design must value the environmental and energy security attributes of nuclear power and other clean energy sources. Governments should recognise the cost-competitiveness of safely extending the lifetimes of existing nuclear plants. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As governments and industry address these challenges, the IEA is ready to provide support with data, analysis and real-world solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>W3C and the WHATWG sign agreement to collaborate on single version of HTML, DOM</title>
<link>https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;imageLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2019/05/w3c-whatwg-logos.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2019/05/w3c-whatwg-logos-150px.png&quot; alt=&quot;logos of W3C and WHATWG&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today W3C and the WHATWG signed an agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU.html&quot;&gt;Memorandum of Understanding jointly published as the WHATWG/W3C Joint Working Mode&lt;/a&gt; gives the specifics of this collaboration. This is the culmination of a careful exploration of effective partnership mechanisms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/blog/2017/12/whatwg-working-mode-changes/&quot;&gt;since December 2017&lt;/a&gt; after the WHATWG adopted many shared features as their work-mode and an IPR policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML Working Group which we will &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2019Apr/0004.html&quot;&gt;soon recharter&lt;/a&gt; will assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and bring WHATWG Review Drafts to Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the belief that having two distinct HTML and DOM specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the community, and the mutual desire to bring the work back together, W3C and WHATWG agree to the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;show_items&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;W3C and WHATWG work together on HTML and DOM, in the WHATWG repositories, to produce a Living Standard and Recommendation/Review Draft-snapshots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WHATWG maintains the HTML and DOM Living Standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W3C facilitates community work directly in the WHATWG repositories (bridging communities, developing use cases, filing issues, writing tests, mediating issue resolution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W3C stops independent publishing of a designated list of specifications related to HTML and DOM and instead will work to take WHATWG Review Drafts to W3C Recommendations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;W3C remains committed to ensuring that HTML development continues to take into account the needs of the global community, and continues to improve in areas such as accessibility, internationalization and privacy while providing greater interoperability, performance and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may read in W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe’s blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/05/w3c-and-whatwg-to-work-together-to-advance-the-open-web-platform/&quot;&gt;W3C and WHATWG to work together to advance the open Web platform&lt;/a&gt; further contextual information and additional aspects of the collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google’s Shadow Work Force: Temps Who Outnumber Full-Time Employees</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Mindy Cruz had an offer for a full-time position at another big tech company when she accepted a temporary job as a recruiter at Google in 2017. The pay was less and the benefits were not as good, but it was one step closer to her dream of becoming a Google employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Cruz became one of Google’s many temps and contractors — a shadow work force that now outnumbers the company’s full-time employees. But she never made the jump to full time. She was swiftly fired after a Google manager, who she said had harassed her for months, told the temp agency that had hired her that he wanted her gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;High-tech companies have long promoted the idea that they are egalitarian, idyllic workplaces. And Google, perhaps more than any other, has represented that image, with a reputation for enviable salaries and benefits and lavish perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the company’s increasing reliance on temps and contractors has some Google employees wondering if management is undermining its carefully crafted culture. As of March, Google worked with roughly 121,000 temps and contractors around the world, compared with 102,000 full-time employees, according to an internal document obtained by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though they often work side by side with full-timers, Google temps are usually employed by outside agencies. They make less money, have different benefits plans and have no paid vacation time in the United States, according to more than a dozen current and former Google temp and contract workers, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Better treatment for those workers was one of the demands made by organizers of a Google employee walkout last year to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s time to end the two-tier system that treats some workers as expendable,” the walkout organizers &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GoogleWalkout/status/1110990194390589442?s=20&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in March.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, did not respond to those demands, a group of anonymous contractors sent an open letter demanding equal pay and better opportunities for advancement. In April, hundreds of Google employees signed another letter protesting the dismissal of about 80 percent of a 43-person team of contingent workers working on the company’s artificial intelligence assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In response, Google said it was changing a number of its policies to improve conditions for its temps and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The reliance on temporary help has generated more controversy inside Google than it has at other big tech outfits, but the practice is common in Silicon Valley. Contingent labor accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the workers at most technology firms, according to estimates by OnContracting, a site that helps people find tech contracting positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;OnContracting estimates that a technology company can save $100,000 a year on average per American job by using a contractor instead of a full-time employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s creating a caste system inside companies,” said Pradeep Chauhan, who runs OnContracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In statements to The Times, Google did not directly address concerns that it had created a two-tiered work force, but said it did not hire contractors simply to save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Eileen Naughton, Google’s vice president of people operations, said that if a contingent worker “is not having a good experience, we provide lots of ways to report complaints or express concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She added, “We investigate, we hold individuals to account and we work to make things right for any person impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-29c92eda&quot;&gt;‘Googlers Are Everything’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Google became a public company in 2004, its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, wrote that they believed in rewarding employees with unusual benefits because “our employees, who have named themselves Googlers, are everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But not everyone doing work for Google over the years has been a Googler. The company has been using temps and contractors since its early years in projects like scanning books for online search. According to one former Google employee, temps and contractors accounted for about a third of the work force about a decade ago, and that share has steadily climbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google’s contractors handle a range of jobs, from content moderation to software testing. Their hourly pay varies, from $16 per hour for an entry-level content reviewer to $125 per hour for a top-shelf software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google usually pays staffing companies, which find the workers and provide them with salaries and benefits as their employer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the current and former contract and temp workers, as well as four Google employees, said Google was the employer in all but name. It decides what jobs they do, dictates where and what hours they work, and often decides if and when to fire them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google’s contractors are barred from company events like holiday parties and all-hands meetings. They are not permitted to look at internal job postings or attend company job fairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In some instances, email messages about workplace security concerns that went out to full-time staff were not shared with contract workers even though they worked in the same offices, the contractors and temps told The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In their letter to Mr. Pichai, the temp workers said the company sent security updates only to full-time employees during a shooting at YouTube’s offices last year, leaving contractors “defenseless in the line of fire.” They were also barred from a meeting the next day to discuss the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Andrea Faville, a YouTube spokeswoman, said that the exclusion had been an oversight and that contractors had been invited to another companywide meeting later that week. She said all security updates went out to all staff, including contractors and temps, although two contractors working at YouTube said they had not received notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Google limits contractors to two years of work on a project, but on one code-named Pygmalion, they returned after a six-month break.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim Wilson/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-ani50b eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-26fbb6c0&quot;&gt;Temps for Training A.I.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google has relied on temporary workers even when the work has become more permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the company started a research project code-named Pygmalion in 2014 to improve its speech-recognition technology, it hired temporary employees — many of whom had doctorates in linguistics — to help annotate and structure data so Google’s computers could better understand what people were saying, according to five people familiar with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The team grew to about 250, and the majority were contractors. Some contractors worked two years on the project, which is Google’s limit, and took a six-month break before returning in a similar role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As the project grew, Google managers pressed contractors to do more. In a complaint to the human resources department, one full-time employee said project leaders pressured contractors to work longer hours than stated in their contracts without reporting overtime. The project leaders made subtle promises of conversion to full-time status, two of the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google said it had learned of a possible violation in February and immediately opened an investigation, which is still continuing, into unpaid overtime. The company said it instructed employees not to promise temps future employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Our policy is clear that all temporary workers must be paid for any overtime worked,” Ms. Naughton said. “If we find that anyone isn’t properly paid, we make sure they are compensated appropriately and take action against any Google employee who violates this policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;States and the federal government are trying to define the distinction between contractors and employees more clearly. The difference usually depends on how much control the company exercises over the worker. That is based on certain criteria, like whether the company has the power to hire or fire the employee, or supervise and control work schedules or conditions of employment. As a result, companies keep contingent workers at arm’s length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In response to the issues with its temp work force, Google is both trying to improve their treatment and distancing itself from their management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last month, Google said it would require staffing agencies to provide contract and temp workers with comprehensive health care, paid parental leave and an hourly minimum wage of $15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many contractors who reported to a Google employee are now being managed by another contractor, who is the only one permitted to speak to full-time employees, three of the workers said. And Google is moving groups of contractors out of some offices in the United States and into separate buildings owned by Google but mostly managed by outside contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Ms. Cruz, the temp recruiter, worked in a Google office in Mountain View, Calif., she sat with permanent recruiters and used a Google email address. Her manager, a Google employee, said he expected to convert her to full-time status after a year as long as she met her hiring quotas, which she did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That’s why she didn’t say anything when her manager started asking her out. She repeatedly rebuffed him, she said, and his advances turned to harassment. He once invited her to a team outing at a winery that turned out to be just the two of them. That night, he tried to kiss her and put his hand up her dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I had heard that a lot of times when you say something to your recruiting agency, they just take you out of the situation and put you somewhere else,” Ms. Cruz said. “And I didn’t want my job to go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She said she had considered reporting a claim when she suspected her manager was looking for a way to fire her. But she was fired in February before she had a chance. Her account was detailed in legal documents seen by The Times. Ms. Cruz’s sister, Kristi Beck, said her sister had told her about the harassment while it had been going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Cruz’s agency, Search Wizards of Sarasota, Fla., told her that Google was dissatisfied with her work. She was told that the dismissal was unusual, but that there wasn’t much the agency could do because her manager wanted her gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Miranda Hinshaw, chief executive of Search Wizards, said the company did not “discuss past or present employees/contractors with any third party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Cruz filed a complaint to Google a month later. Google said it had fired the manager in April after it investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Cruz agreed to a settlement in mediation after months of proceedings. (Google said the matter was now resolved.) But one part of the settlement still gnaws at her: She is not allowed to work for Google again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It feels so unfair,” she said. “They took away this very big opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>I can see your local web servers</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;How many web servers are running on your machine right now? Do all of those development web servers have a secure login, and restrictive CORS permissions? You don’t know? Allow me to check for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see any results like &lt;span class=&quot;result bad&quot;&gt;localhost:3000 is available!&lt;/span&gt;, you should secure whatever you have running on that port, because all websites you visit have access to it - including the page you’re reading! It is not sufficient security to only bind to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; (the “loopback interface”), because there are untrusted programs running on your machine right now that have access to the loopback interface. Those untrusted programs are web pages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake is easily made. Here’s an example vulnerable app, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://expressjs.com/&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt;, a popular web framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'express'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'cors'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'/'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'My personal admin site'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things worse, many servers bind to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the server is available from anywhere that can reach the machine. For example, Express does this by default! If you’re at work right now, you might have dozens of other employees on your local network. We can scan for all of their exposed servers, too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see any results like &lt;span class=&quot;result bad&quot;&gt;192.168.0.4:3000 is available!&lt;/span&gt;, you should tell your colleague to secure whatever she has running on that port, because it is accessible by all websites visited by all your colleagues! It is not sufficient security to hide behind a NAT (e.g. your WiFi router), because there are untrusted programs running on your network right now that have access to every machine - again, those untrusted programs are web pages!&lt;/p&gt;
