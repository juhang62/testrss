<title>A Code Glitch May Have Caused Errors in More Than a Hundred Published Studies</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjwda/a-code-glitch-may-have-caused-errors-in-more-than-100-published-studies</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjwda/a-code-glitch-may-have-caused-errors-in-more-than-100-published-studies</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Hawaiʻi have uncovered a glitch in a piece of code that could have yielded incorrect results in over 100 published studies that cited the original paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glitch caused results of a common chemistry computation to vary depending on the operating system used, causing discrepancies among Mac, Windows, and Linux systems. The researchers published the revelation and a debugged version of the script, which amounts to roughly 1,000 lines of code, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b03216&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Tuesday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Organic Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This simple glitch in the original script calls into question the conclusions of a significant number of papers on a wide range of topics in a way that cannot be easily resolved from published information because the operating system is rarely mentioned,” the new paper reads. “Authors who used these scripts should certainly double-check their results and any relevant conclusions using the modified scripts in the [supplementary information].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuheng Luo, a graduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, discovered the glitch this summer when he was verifying the results of research conducted by chemistry professor Philip Williams on cyanobacteria. The aim of the project was to &quot;try to find compounds that are effective against cancer,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under supervision of University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa assistant chemistry professor Rui Sun, Luo used a script written in Python that was published as part of a 2014 paper by Patrick Willoughby, Matthew Jansma, and Thomas Hoye in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2014.042&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Protocols&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The code computes chemical shift values for NMR, or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a common technique used by chemists to determine the molecular make-up of a sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luo’s results did not match up with the NMR values that Williams’ group had previously calculated, and according to Sun, when his students ran the code on their computers, they realized that different operating systems were producing different results. Sun then adjusted the code to fix the glitch, which had to do with how different operating systems sort files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willoughby, the first author of the 2014 study who wrote the script, called the new study “a beautiful example of science working to advance the work we reported in 2014.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They did a tremendous service to the community in figuring this out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams said that the original study is an elegantly written paper that is “incredibly useful to a large group of people, and the error is very subtle.&quot; Nevertheless, the researchers believe that the glitch could have produced serious downstream effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the code led Williams to wrongly identify the contents of his sample, chemists trying to recreate the molecule to test as a potential cancer drug would be chasing after the wrong compound, Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;“The process of science here worked exactly as it’s supposed to&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how many papers this glitch may have affected—researchers do not typically disclose the operating system they use for their analyses since it should be irrelevant, Williams said. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2014.042/metrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Nature Protocols&lt;/em&gt;, the 2014 paper has been accessed nearly 1,900 times and cited in 158 other studies. However, not every study that cited the paper may have used the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Keyzers, a chemistry lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand who had cited the protocol in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b00493&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this year, said in an email that he was not aware of the glitch. He added that he was not “unduly worried” about his results since his group did not use the script containing the glitch. “I will certainly check our data carefully to make sure that we are not making any undue claims though,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late July, Williams and Sun reached out to the authors of the original paper, alerting them to the glitch. Williams said he hoped that by working together, they could bring the problem to the attention of researchers who had used the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I personally haven’t had the opportunity to go to the original authors [of a study] and announce a bug, so I wasn’t sure what to expect,” Sun said, adding that the authors were “very gracious” and encouraged him and Williams to publish their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process of science here worked exactly as it’s supposed to,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process chemist Lucas Moore, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LucasCMoore/status/1181615421922824192&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted about the study&lt;/a&gt;, said in an email that “news of a bug like this is something that we in the scientific community tend to spread far and wide–we really want to get it right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willoughby and Hoye plan to update the &lt;em&gt;Nature Protocols&lt;/em&gt; study acknowledging the glitch and providing Sun’s fixed code, according to correspondence from Hoye quoted in the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for &lt;em&gt;Nature Protocols&lt;/em&gt; said that they are looking into the issues raised in the new study, but for confidentiality reasons cannot comment on individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident is a reminder that science is collaborative and ideally self-correcting, but that nothing can be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very small and subtle error,” Williams said. “We all kind of assume that a computer program always spits out the correct answer.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon stops charitable donations via Amazon Smile if you turn off notifications</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/dgtgr4/amazon_app_disables_charitable_donations_via/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/dgtgr4/amazon_app_disables_charitable_donations_via/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;If you don't want the notifications, just turn off Amazon Smile and donate your own money. They donate half a percent. That's 50 cents for every $100 that you spend on &lt;em class=&quot;_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE&quot;&gt;eligible&lt;/em&gt; items (i.e. sold and shipped through Amazon, not sure if there are other restrictions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I get that something is better than nothing, but I feel like Amazon Smile might actually have a detrimental effect to charities since people who would otherwise donate their own money may feel like they've already contributed, and then contribute nothing of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A uBlock Origin update was rejected from the Chrome Web Store</title>
<link>https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/745</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/745</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Just for the sake of having tried, I submitted 1.22.5rc2, and I received the same exact answer as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also sent the following reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &quot;bundles of unrelated functionality&quot; in uBlock Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could you please be more specific about which part of uBlock Origin you&lt;br/&gt;consider to be a &quot;bundle&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;32.651162790698&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject Re: Chrome Web Store: Removal notification for uBlock Origin development build&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Developer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Google Chrome item, &quot; uBlock Origin development build &quot;, with ID: cgbcahbpdhpcegmbfconppldiemgcoii did not comply with our policies and was removed from the Google Chrome Web Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your item did not comply with the following section of our policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extension should have a single purpose that is clear to users. Do not create an extension that requires users to accept bundles of unrelated functionality, such as an email notifier and a news headline aggregator. If two pieces of functionality are clearly separate, they should be put into two different extensions, and users should have the ability to install and uninstall them separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an extension that provides a broad array of functionalities on the New Tab Page/ Start-up Page but also changes the default search are better delivered as separate extensions, so that users can select the services they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on the new Chrome extensions quality policy, please refer to the FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/single_purpose&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/single_purpose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer Terms of Service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/terms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program Policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/program_policies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/program_policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branding Guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/branding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/branding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, stonewalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the next uBO release will essentially be what 1.22.5rc2 is, consider that uBO is probably coming to an end of life in the Chrome Web Store -- there is no good reason to believe uBO 1.22.5rc2 would no longer be rejected with only changing the version number to 1.23.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who still want to use uBO will have to find another browser for which uBO will still be available.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What to Do When You Get Sherlocked by Apple</title>
<link>https://blog.astropad.com/sherlocked-by-apple/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.astropad.com/sherlocked-by-apple/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Six Lessons We Learned the Hard Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty standard for at least a few third-party developers to get crushed during Apple’s annual press conference. At some point in the presentation, Apple will announce a new OS feature, while some developer watches in disbelief as Apple swindles their entire business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a phenomenon widely referred to as getting “sherlocked” (you can read more about how the term came to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/babbage/2012/07/13/youve-been-sherlocked&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It’s oddly flattering and intensely infuriating, and I know this first hand because it happened to the company I work for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re Astropad — a small, nimble, bootstrapped startup with products for creative pros like &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://astropad.com/studio/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Astropad Studio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://lunadisplay.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Luna Display&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2019, Apple announced a new feature in macOS Catalina called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-previews-macos-catalina/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;Sidecar&lt;/a&gt; that closely copied our product lines. For our team of just 13 people, it was devastating news. Watching Apple present Sidecar to the world was like seeing years of hard work flash before your eyes while someone else takes credit for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Cdlh_tu-iayk0HxOLxsLns1woMoxjcb898_puIbAMX_y-34HT28NWaU2kuRWV1A2lOW6EWR8gcD4d11U7sQL1LI8LdHu43AsavxOhjysIIEcV07UbZcHxIvyWPKxzMPfdl1mRd6-&quot; alt=&quot;This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Cdlh_tu-iayk0HxOLxsLns1woMoxjcb898_puIbAMX_y-34HT28NWaU2kuRWV1A2lOW6EWR8gcD4d11U7sQL1LI8LdHu43AsavxOhjysIIEcV07UbZcHxIvyWPKxzMPfdl1mRd6-&quot; width=&quot;361&quot; height=&quot;254&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial shock wore off, we woke up the next day ready to make moves. But there’s no playbook to guide you through the aftermath of being sherlocked. In fact, most third-party developers are reluctant to even talk about it publicly for fear of Apple retaliating. Apple typically holds third-party developers in tight NDA chokeholds that make it difficult for them to talk about the experience of getting sherlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that the Sidecar dust has settled, I want to share our experience with other players in the Apple ecosystem. My intent is two-fold: On a personal level, it’s therapeutic to reflect on how this has impacted our work. But more importantly, my hope is that by candidly sharing our story, I can pass along some of the painful insights we learned along the way — like how you can prevent getting sherlocked, and what to do if it happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;. . .&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know your true competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big misconception is that your main competitors are the other companies creating similar products to yours. In our case, we viewed Astropad and Luna Display’s biggest competitors as other second display and graphics tablet creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all along, we really should have been worried about our platform provider, Apple. There will always be infinite ways to differentiate yourself against other competitor companies via price, features, and target markets. But if your platform provider decides to step into your domain, it’s a tough battle to position your product against a free, native feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tk3T1ePJDREWQQOR7Yku2vWwcArv2TMtS_B-AnXXrQVGw-touu2vfamEEsi3XjxD1BKe197Oc0m2wF2PmCfEpTTEjh_0Tv2EJJkL8KzLX3DObqGNpQCvqQhBH40zxSNenSxBQ48E&quot; alt=&quot;This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is tk3T1ePJDREWQQOR7Yku2vWwcArv2TMtS_B-AnXXrQVGw-touu2vfamEEsi3XjxD1BKe197Oc0m2wF2PmCfEpTTEjh_0Tv2EJJkL8KzLX3DObqGNpQCvqQhBH40zxSNenSxBQ48E&quot; width=&quot;349&quot; height=&quot;307&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We admittedly got swept up in a false romance with Apple. Over the past few years, Apple routinely invited us to demo our products at their headquarters, and offered to help us out with whatever business and engineering challenges we faced. They also ordered thousands of dollars’ worth of our hardware, and we naively thought it was because they were interested in our product. It turns out that they were… just not in the way we were thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson #1:&lt;/strong&gt; Think twice before cozying up to your platform provider (whether that’s Apple, Twitter, Facebook, or Google) because they’re the stealthiest and most powerful competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t wait to diversify &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple happens to threaten one of your products, it’s crucial to have other products to fall back on. In our case, Sidecar hit our hardware product, Luna Display, pretty significantly; but we’ve been able to stand on the other leg of our business, Astropad Studio, to keep us financially secure while we navigate what’s next. And it’s never too early to start thinking about diversification. We launched Luna on Kickstarter in 2017, but Luna had only been publicly available for eight months before Apple announced Sidecar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversification seems like an obvious way to protect your business. But if you’re part of a small bootstrapped startup like us, you’ll understand how difficult it is to start thinking about your &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; product line when it still feels like you’re trying to get your &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; product off the ground. Even though there’s a constant voice in your head warning you “not to put all your eggs in one basket,” there’s always a more immediate fire to deal with that captures your attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s understandable how easy it is to end up in this situation. But if this sounds like your business, take this as a wake up call to stop procrastinating because diversification will  be the best buffer you have if Apple comes after you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson #2:&lt;/strong&gt; The more legs you have to stand on, the less likely you are to fall if one of them gets knocked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build a culture of experimentation &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure how to strike a balance between maintaining existing products and expanding into new ones, a good place to start is with assembling the right team. When times get tough, you want an adaptable team that can change course quickly — not employees that dip out when the future is uncertain. For Astropad, we’ve stacked our little team with people that appreciate a culture of curiosity and experimentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CVJQNgXMWXpFD-v6cZogqjyYgwQu89L4cH31FbgpaaRx-Vm7w44U_43AEydHE4SbYsRJrWgb2tZ6pZ3k9mtBEjxG4wls1weKAT-JKlC8tiabYAS4MWX3gCXR6FEoegfyA3YsYPWq&quot; alt=&quot;This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is CVJQNgXMWXpFD-v6cZogqjyYgwQu89L4cH31FbgpaaRx-Vm7w44U_43AEydHE4SbYsRJrWgb2tZ6pZ3k9mtBEjxG4wls1weKAT-JKlC8tiabYAS4MWX3gCXR6FEoegfyA3YsYPWq&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;322&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to maintaining our existing products, we always have a few side experiments running where we’re testing and researching new product ideas. We’ll frequently build prototypes and talk to customers about new product concepts. After some experimentation we’ll decide to either kill the product idea, keep moving forward, or put it on hold until the time is right. For example, in the months before Sidecar, we had been doing R&amp;amp;D on a completely new hardware product. But when Sidecar was announced, we decided to quickly reprioritize and focus on different engineering initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fostering this sort of creative and experimental mindset can only come from the top-down. Astropad’s founders, Matt Ronge and Giovanni Donelli, have always encouraged a trial and error approach. It all starts with being comfortable with a level of uncertainty, and having the curiosity to explore new directions to take the company forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson #3:&lt;/strong&gt; Assemble an adaptable team that likes to experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go where your customers go &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always knew that we wanted to go cross-platform. For quite awhile, we’ve heard from creative professionals about an exodus from Mac to Windows. For these creatives, it all comes down to getting more bang for your buck — super powerful PCs at a lower price than Apple products. In fact, we’d often hear from people &lt;em&gt;begging&lt;/em&gt; us to come to Windows. But even though we knew the market was waiting for us, we pushed off the Windows effort because it created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.astropad.com/the-catch-22-of-apple-apis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;catch-22 situation of really tough engineering problems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundational engineering for our products was tightly wrapped around the Apple ecosystem, with our code relying heavily on Apple APIs and Objective-C. The thought of unraveling ourselves from this ecosystem was hard to imagine, especially when we still felt like we had more room to grow in Apple’s market. It took something as catastrophic as Sidecar to scare us out of that mindset, and now expanding into the Windows market is our top priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, every member of our engineering team is learning the Rust programming language to bring our code cross-platform. And we’ve already seen the benefits of Rust, like faster code and more reliable performance. We learned the hard way that it’s no longer safe territory to be a single-platform developer, but we’re thrilled to be taking steps to meet our customers over in the Windows world. If you’re curious about our journey to Windows via Rust, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.astropad.com/why-rust/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;follow along here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson #4:&lt;/strong&gt; Start with a multi-platform-compatible foundation from the very beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seize the narrative &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Sidecar was announced, a flurry of tech sites published articles about the new Catalina feature. The good news was that at least the press recognized that Sidecar was a close replica of our products. The bad news was that many articles claimed Luna was suddenly now obsolete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LUXux_YlcyazaFF0NR_zteRqisFA7YEG4lsDkXd3K7XWErKOHPJ8h7I9tQfcqWF40kWL8iRaYDoBXJPlMPiJ7SYgP6cuoDypAviRPq8pj_jc5v7qfL-D8mpcEXb7ESa0ji1MKk5S&quot; alt=&quot;This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is LUXux_YlcyazaFF0NR_zteRqisFA7YEG4lsDkXd3K7XWErKOHPJ8h7I9tQfcqWF40kWL8iRaYDoBXJPlMPiJ7SYgP6cuoDypAviRPq8pj_jc5v7qfL-D8mpcEXb7ESa0ji1MKk5S&quot; width=&quot;353&quot; height=&quot;295&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking a few days to let the press quiet down, we decided to publish a candid “&lt;a href=&quot;https://lunadisplay.com/pages/message-from-luna-founders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;Message from our Founders&lt;/a&gt;.” We wanted to set a hopeful and optimistic tone, and to let our customers know that even though this was a disappointing setback, we still have big plans for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message was immediately well-received by our customers. We got many encouraging emails and messages from followers saying that they believe in us and are excited to follow our journey. The press was quick to pick up the story too, with new headlines like “&lt;em&gt;Luna Display not giving up in the face of Apple’s Sidecar&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;Luna Display founders say the app isn’t going anywhere despite Apple’s Sidecar.&lt;/em&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time as our founder message, we released an app update for both Astropad and Luna Display that improved performance and refreshed the UX. We wanted to reiterate the message that we’re committed to our customers and continuous product improvement. After so much negativity, it felt good to swap the “sherlocked” narrative with a more optimistic tone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson #5:&lt;/strong&gt; Own your narrative and create a more positive story for the press by letting your customers know that you’re still devoted to them. Your customers are your best spin team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When Apple goes wide — dive deep &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re unlucky enough to get sherlocked, take comfort in knowing that Apple’s move just validates your market space. Apple seeks to serve the masses — so if your product can capture just a &lt;em&gt;sliver&lt;/em&gt; of Apple’s market, it’s absolutely possible to have a thriving business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/U1NHREqS80ywue5DldrKlxkpyojA8_QTavFdw_WmI2qoXzkdE20XYKAUtuFRgCJsxLv71WwRNkwfikzfzsZuMiCWwHrgJdXAvmCkh7F0o-CRTnN-bDxXAK52nYQU8KDRomZagMht&quot; alt=&quot;This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is U1NHREqS80ywue5DldrKlxkpyojA8_QTavFdw_WmI2qoXzkdE20XYKAUtuFRgCJsxLv71WwRNkwfikzfzsZuMiCWwHrgJdXAvmCkh7F0o-CRTnN-bDxXAK52nYQU8KDRomZagMht&quot; width=&quot;322&quot; height=&quot;277&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the basic functionality of Apple’s Sidecar competes directly with our products, it doesn’t compete with all of the rich features and deep customization that we’ve built into Astropad Studio. We’ve grown our business by catering to creative professionals; it’s a market that has highly specific workspace needs, and they look for products like Astropad Studio that allow them to customize every aspect of their workflow. In other words, while Sidecar will be good enough for the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; user, we’ve carved out a niche space for the &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt; users that need a more powerful tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months following the announcement of Sidecar, we’ve really leaned into what sets our products apart. We’ve featured unique use cases &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://lunadisplay.com/pages/luna-and-mac-mini&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like this Mac mini setup&lt;/a&gt; more prominently on our Luna website, and we ran a marketing campaign to show off all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.astropad.com/astropad-studio-features/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;rich features in Astropad Studio&lt;/a&gt;. And in addition to expanding into the Windows market, we’re also working on building new features into Luna Display, like Mac-to-Mac extended display functions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson #6:&lt;/strong&gt; Lean into your competitive advantages by showing off what differentiates you from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;When you take a birds-eye view, it’s the small startups and indie devs that are pushing innovation in the tech world. It’s an imperfect synergy, though: with too much power, big tech like Apple eventually swallows up the innovators. The more sherlocking that happens, the more careful we’ll be about dabbling in Apple’s playground. And the people that pay the ultimate price are the consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you find yourself in our situation, don’t underestimate the power of your team, your brand, or your customers. &lt;em&gt;Refocus&lt;/em&gt; your energy on your users by stopping to listen to what they’re asking for; &lt;em&gt;harness&lt;/em&gt; your team’s agile spirit; &lt;em&gt;lean in&lt;/em&gt; to your vulnerabilities; and &lt;em&gt;double-down&lt;/em&gt; on what you do best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may always be a lingering bitterness towards Apple for throwing us such a curveball. But at the end of the day, I know that when we emerge from the other side, our team will be stronger than ever. We’re small, but mighty — a nimble and curious bunch, capable of throwing our own curveballs. 😉 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The end of uBlock origin for Google Chrome?</title>
<link>https://www.ghacks.net/2019/10/12/the-end-of-ublock-origin-for-google-chrome/#comments</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ghacks.net/2019/10/12/the-end-of-ublock-origin-for-google-chrome/#comments</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There has been lots of talk about Google's proposed changes to the Chrome web browser's extensions system and how these changes would affect content blockers and other extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new manifest file for Chrome extensions could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2019/01/22/chrome-extension-manifest-v3-could-end-ublock-origin-for-chrome/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;end extensions like uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; for the web browser. Google changed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2019/05/30/google-still-on-track-to-limit-ad-blockers-in-chrome/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;some parameters&lt;/a&gt; after it faced heavy user and developer criticism but did not revert the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2019/06/24/first-chrome-browser-with-manifest-v3-for-extensions-expected-in-late-july/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;course completely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond Hill (gorhill), the developer of uBlock Origin &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/745&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; recently that Google rejected a new developer version of the extension. Developers upload new extension versions to the Chrome Web Store to replace existing versions; Google runs automated scans of these tools and may also look at the uploaded extensions manually before allowing or rejecting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-155267&quot; src=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ublock-origin-rejected.png&quot; alt=&quot;ublock origin rejected&quot; width=&quot;1056&quot; height=&quot;539&quot;/&gt;via Raymond Hill / GitHub
&lt;p&gt;In an email to the developer, Google stated that the extension violated one of the Chrome Store's policies that prohibits the bundling of unrelated functionality in extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email provides no information on the actual violation other than that, a practice that Google has been criticized for in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill, a long-time developer, had no illusions that Google would provide actionable information about the rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point speculating one way or another, my experience with the CWS in the past is that we will never know why it was labelled &quot;REJECTED&quot;, they never disclose the exact &quot;why&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer version of the extension is used by fewer users than the stable version which means that the rejection does not affect the bulk of users of the extension yet. The main issue with the rejection is that the next stable version of the extension will be more or less identical to the rejected developer version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still the chance that it will go through, it is more likely that it too will be rejected by Google and that this could effectively end uBlock Origin for Google Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the next uBO release will essentially be what 1.22.5rc2 is, consider that uBO is probably coming to an end of life in the Chrome Web Store -- there is no good reason to believe uBO 1.22.5rc2 would no longer be rejected with only changing the version number to 1.23.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill recommends that users find another browser that continues to support uBlock Origin if they want to continue using the extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the extension is available for many major browsers including Mozilla Firefox and other Chromium-based web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to know why the extension was rejected from the Chrome Web Store unless Google would provide further information on the issue. While it is certainly possible that the stable extension update would be allowed by Google, it seems more likely that it will be rejected as well by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now You&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your take on the development?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Money Behind The Climate Denial Movement (2013)</title>
<link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/meet-the-money-behind-the-climate-denial-movement-180948204/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/meet-the-money-behind-the-climate-denial-movement-180948204/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;93.044427989633&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2013/05/a-friendly-reminder-from-pretty-much-every-climate-scientist-in-the-world-climate-change-is-real/%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The overwhelming majority of climate scientists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2013/08/its-95-percent-certain-that-were-the-main-cause-of-climate-change/%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;international governmental bodies&lt;/a&gt;, relevant research institutes and scientific societies are in unison in saying that climate change is real, that it's a problem, and that we should probably do something about it now, not later. And yet, for some reason, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/smartnews/2012/10/three-quarters-of-americans-now-believe-climate-change-is-affecting-the-weather/%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the idea persists in some peoples' minds&lt;/a&gt; that climate change is up for debate, or that climate change is no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it's not “for some reason” that people are confused. There's a very obvious reason. There is a very well-funded, well-orchestrated climate change-denial movement, one funded by powerful people with very deep pockets. &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-013-1018-7%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In a new and incredibly thorough study&lt;/a&gt;, Drexel University sociologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~brullerj/%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Brulle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drexel.edu/~/media/Files/now/pdfs/Institutionalizing%20Delay%20-%20Climatic%20Change.ashx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;took a deep dive into the financial structure of the climate deniers, to see who is holding the purse strings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drexel.edu/~/media/Files/now/pdfs/Institutionalizing%20Delay%20-%20Climatic%20Change.ashx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to Brulle's research&lt;/a&gt;, the 91 think tanks and advocacy organizations and trade associations that make up the American climate denial industry &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/20/conservative-groups-1bn-against-climate-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pull down just shy of a billion dollars each year&lt;/a&gt;, money used to lobby or sway public opinion on climate change and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The anti-climate effort has been largely underwritten by conservative billionaires,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/20/conservative-groups-1bn-against-climate-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;says the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “often working through secretive funding networks. They have displaced corporations as the prime supporters of 91 think tanks, advocacy groups and industry associations which have worked to block action on climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is how wealthy individuals or corporations translate their economic power into political and cultural power,” he said. “They have their profits and they hire people to write books that say climate change is not real. They hire people to go on TV and say climate change is not real. It ends up that people without economic power don't have the same size voice as the people who have economic power, and so it ends up distorting democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/environment/climate-of-doubt/robert-brulle-inside-the-climate-change-countermovement/%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Last year, PBS talked to Brulle about his investigation into the climate change countermovement&lt;/a&gt;. The project, says Brulle, is the first part of three: in the future he'll turn a similar eye to the climate movement and to the environmental movement. But for now, the focus is on the deniers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what you can see in the movement itself is that it has two real roots. One is in the conservative movement itself, in that you see a lot of conservative foundations that had been funding the growth of the conservative movement all along now appear as funding the climate countermovement. You also can see dedicated industry foundations that come in to start funding the climate countermovement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s kind of a combination of both industry and conservative philanthropies that are funding this process, and what they did was they borrowed a great deal of the strategy and tactics that came out of the tobacco industry’s efforts to prevent action on the health impacts of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you see is the tactics that this movement uses were developed and tested in the tobacco industry first, and now they’re being applied to the climate change movement, and in fact, some of the same people and some of the same organizations that were involved in the tobacco issue are also involved in climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate denial movement is a powerful political force, says Brulle. They've got to be, too, to outweigh in the public's mind the opinions of pretty much every relevant scientist. Brulle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With delay and obfuscation as their goals, the U.S. CCCM has been quite successful in recent decades. However, the key actors in this cultural and political conflict are not just the “experts” who appear in the media spotlight. The roots of climate-change denial go deeper, because individuals’ efforts have been bankrolled and directed by organizations that receive sustained support from foundations and funders known for their overall commitments to conservative causes. Thus to fully understand the opposition to climate change legislation, we need to focus on the institutionalized efforts that have built and maintain this organized campaign. Just as in a theatrical show, there are stars in the spotlight. In the drama of climate change, these are often prominent contrarian scientists or conservative politicians, such as Senator James Inhofe. However, they are only the most visible and transparent parts of a larger production. Supporting this effort are directors, script writers, and, most importantly, a series of producers, in the form of conservative foundations. Clarifying the institutional dynamics of the CCCM can aid our understanding of how anthropogenic climate change has been turned into a controversy rather than a scientific fact in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Eliud Kipchoge Breaks Two-Hour Marathon Barrier</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/sports/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-record.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/sports/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-record.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;VIENNA — On a misty Saturday morning in Vienna, on a course specially chosen for speed, in an athletic spectacle of historic proportions, Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya ran 26.2 miles in a once-inconceivable time of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EliudKipchoge/status/1182934782684123136&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 hour 59 minutes 40 seconds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In becoming the first person to cover the marathon distance in less than two hours, Kipchoge, 34, achieved a sports milestone granted almost mythical status in the running world, breaking through a temporal barrier that many would have deemed untouchable only a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kipchoge, an eight-time major marathon winner and three-time Olympic medalist, pounded his chest twice as he crossed the finish line in Vienna’s leafy Prater Park, where the majority of the run had unfolded on a long straightaway of recently paved road, with roundabouts on either end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Cheered on by a thick crowd of spectators, he was lifted into the air by members of his team, including the 41 professional runners who had acted as pacesetters during the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For Kipchoge, the feat merely burnished his credentials as the world’s greatest marathoner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Together, when we run, we can make this world a beautiful world,” Kipchoge said after finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For all its magnitude, the accomplishment will be regarded largely as a symbolic one. The eye-popping time, which was 10 seconds quicker than the 1:59:50 time Kipchoge and his team had set out to achieve, will not be officially recognized as a world record because it was not run under open marathon conditions and because it featured a dense rotation of professional pacesetters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What the event lacked in officially sanctioned gravitas, though, it seemed determined to make up for with theater and grandiose proclamations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The run, organized by the petrochemical company INEOS, featured a cycle of hype and commercial buildup more reminiscent of a heavyweight prizefight than a road race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Organizers billed the two-hour mark as “the last barrier of modern athletics” and tried to get a hashtag, #nohumanislimited, trending on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kipchoge repeatedly compared a potential sub-two-hour marathon to humanity’s first journey onto the surface of the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The pressure was very big on my shoulders,” said Kipchoge, who revealed he had received a call from President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya the night before the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Whatever the scope of the achievement, it required a prodigious amount of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Seeking the most welcoming environment for Kipchoge to attempt such a feat, the event’s organizers had settled on Vienna: It was not too warm, not too cold and not at all hilly. The altitude, 540 feet above sea level, was just right, and it was only one time zone away from Kipchoge’s training camp in Kaptagat, Kenya, where he had worked out for the past four months under the guidance of his longtime coach, Patrick Sang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He had led a monastic existence there, eating, sleeping and exercising for the sole purpose of running fast. To his normal preparations he added workouts focused on core strength in order to lessen the strain on his hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On Saturday, Kipchoge showed the subtlest signs of strain on his face in the first half of the run and fell a couple seconds behind his desired pace in a few portions. He ran the final stretches of the marathon with his lips curled into a gentle smile. Afterward, he walked with a barely perceptible limp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There are no guarantees in sports,” Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire founder of INEOS, said to Kipchoge after the finish. “You could have had a bad day. But you had a really good day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kipchoge had made an attempt at the two-hour barrier once before. In 2017, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/sports/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-nike-shoes.html?searchResultPosition=6&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;in a similar event organized by Nike&lt;/a&gt;, he ran a 2:00:25 marathon around an auto racetrack in Monza, Italy. It was by far the fastest marathon ever run, but it was not officially recognized as a world record because it was not run under normal race conditions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since then, and in officially sanctioned major marathons, Kipchoge produced the two fastest times in history at the time they were run, posting &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/sports/eliud-kipchoge-marathon-record.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a world-record time&lt;/a&gt; of 2:01:39  in Berlin in 2018 and 2:02:37 last April in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Berlin was about running a world record,” Kipchoge said this past week. “Vienna is about running and breaking history, like the first man on the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He arrived in Austria on Tuesday, but the exact start date for the attempt was not finalized until the following day, and the precise start time was not settled until Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What materialized on Saturday was perhaps the most finely tuned, carefully orchestrated marathon-length run in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kipchoge got out of his hotel bed at 4:50 a.m. and had oatmeal for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At 8:15 a.m., after a three-hour wait that he called “the hardest time ever in my life,” he set out from the Reichsbrücke, a picturesque bridge spanning the Danube, and charged across a stretch of downhill road that led him into the park. There, he ran around a 9.6-kilometer flat circuit, more than 90 percent of which unfurled in a straight line. Portions of the road were painted with lines to highlight the fastest possible path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Kipchoge — who wore a white singlet, white sneakers (Nikes, as of yet unreleased to the public, built around a carbon-fiber plate) and white sleeves on his arms — had immense support. He ran behind an electric timing car driving 4:34 per mile (with a second car on standby) and with his flock of rotating pacesetters (35 on the course, six on reserve) who happened to include some of the best distance runners in the world, including former world and Olympic gold medalists like Bernard Lagat and Matthew Centrowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those pacemakers, wearing black jerseys and stern expressions, formed a protective, aerodynamic pocket around Kipchoge, five of them running in front in an open-V formation and two more in the back. They knew exactly where to run thanks to a pattern of thick, green laser beams projected onto the street by the timing car. At predetermined times, the seven pacemakers would make way for another group of seven to slide in and take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A team member on a bicycle periodically pedaled into the pack to deliver Kipchoge a carbohydrate-heavy cocktail of gels and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Looking at the 1:59:40 time, I got so emotional,” said Lagat, a two-time Olympic medalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Down the final stretch, as it was clear that the milestone was easily in reach, the pacesetters, timing car and accompanying cyclists all peeled away, leaving Kipchoge alone to soak in the shouts and applause of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After crossing the finish line, Kipchoge jumped into the arms of his wife, Grace, and children. Through all his years of competition, all the victories and medals and records in his career, this was the first time his family had watched him run in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This should sound familiar to people who know about Lisp's origins, because it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the way Lisp began&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It consists of two text files meant to be read in parallel: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bellanguage.txt?t=1570888282&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;guide to the Bel language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bel.bel?t=1570888282&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bel source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who just want to see some code examples, there's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/belexamples.txt?t=1570888282&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;file of those&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But of course the Bel source is also a code example, since it's written in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the rate at which I was discovering bugs before publishing Bel, there are bound to be more remaining.

<title>Apple told some Apple TV+ show developers not to anger China</title>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;71.344254032258&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chinese netizens hail Apple’s removal of app that aids HK rioters.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was how the Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party outlet, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1166467.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s removal of HKmap.live, an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police, from the iOS App Store. It was emblematic of the adulatory coverage news outlets controlled by the Chinese government have bestowed on Apple this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apple highly values the Chinese market and removing the controversial app is a smart move,” an analyst said in the article, driving home the party’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://en.people.cn/n3/2019/1010/c90000-9621564.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; “Apple removes app which helped HK rioters elude police” was the business section’s most read story Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s recent actions in China are a continuation of the company’s years-long practice of appeasing Beijing. To do business in China, the company adopts to local dictates, distasteful as they may be to its CEO Tim Cook, an outspoken gay rights &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2017/04/17/apple-ceo-tim-cook-lgbt-free-speech/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advocate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-crisis-2019-5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy crusader&lt;/a&gt;. It's an ironic inversion of a longstanding argument in the West that by bringing China into the world trade system, the country would adopt western values. Instead, China is asking tech companies to adopt its values — and Apple is willing to pay that price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2018 as development on Apple’s slate of exclusive Apple TV+ programming was underway, the company’s leadership gave guidance to the creators of some of those shows to avoid portraying China in a poor light, BuzzFeed News has learned. Sources in position to know said the instruction was communicated by Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of internet software and services, and Morgan Wandell, its head of international content development. It was part of Apple's ongoing efforts to remain in China’s good graces after a 2016 incident in which Beijing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/technology/apple-no-longer-immune-to-chinas-scrutiny-of-us-tech-firms.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies six months after they debuted in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Apple declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They all do it. They have to if they want to play in that market.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;90.644625603865&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s tip toeing around the Chinese government isn’t unusual in Hollywood. It’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/top-gun-maverick-trailer-sparks-controversy-tom-cruise-jacket-1225993&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an accepted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/richard-gere-hollywood-china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;practice&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;They all do it,&quot; one showrunner who was not affiliated with Apple told BuzzFeed News. &quot;They have to if they want to play in that market. And they &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; want to play in that market. Who wouldn't?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Apple, which is in many ways already playing in that market and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/10/20908480/apple-china-hkmap-app-censorship-hong-kong-protests-tim-cook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reliant on China&lt;/a&gt; for tens of billions in annual sales and the manufacture of the hundreds of millions of iPhones it sells around the world each year, it is particularly important to avoid running afoul of Chinese government. And as we’ve seen over the past week, it is particularly vigilant about apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers told BuzzFeed News the incidents are hardly anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We just get a phone call from Apple and they say ‘We just got a call from the Chinese government’ and five minutes later our app is off the App Store,” one US technology executive told BuzzFeed News. “It’s not a line of communication that would be open to any discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have so much market power in general and they wield that pretty indiscriminately,” the US technology executive said of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of HKmap.live was one of a series of actions Apple took at China’s instigation in the past week. Apple removed the Quartz app from its app store in China — “Presumably because of the excellent work our team in Hong Kong has been doing covering the protests,” Quartz technology editor Mike Murphy &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mcwm/status/1182020109633753094&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://qz.com/1723334/apple-removes-taiwan-flag-emoji-in-hong-kong-macau-in-ios-13-1-1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the Taiwan flag emoji for iOS users in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were hardly the first of their kind. In the second half of 2018, Apple challenged or rejected just two of 56 app takedown requests from China, removing 517 apps at the government’s behest, according to the company’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/cn.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transparency report&lt;/a&gt;. Apple said the vast majority of these apps were for porn and gambling, but it has &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/03/apple-pulls-hundreds-apps-china-requests-beijing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;also removed&lt;/a&gt; an unspecified number of virtual private networking and news apps. Apple provided customer data to the Chinese government 96% of the time when it asked about a device, and 98% of the time when it asked about an account. In the US, those numbers &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/us.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;were around 80%&lt;/a&gt; and the US government did not make any app removal requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Apple seemed to brush off the seriousness of an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/01/china-iphone-attack-uyghur-muslims/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exploit attack&lt;/a&gt; directed at the Uighur ethnic minority. “The sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones ‘en masse,’” Apple said in a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/a-message-about-ios-security/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging the attack. “The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post infuriated critics, who called out Apple’s appeasement of the Chinese government and seemingly callous attitude toward the plight of the Uighurs. “Apple's response to this massive hack of iPhones is 'don't worry, it only affected the Uighur community'” Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1171075770422300677&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;. “WTF,” Stoller added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the iPhone maker placed its iCloud storage and cryptographic keys for Chinese users in China, giving the government &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-apple-icloud-insight/apple-moves-to-store-icloud-keys-in-china-raising-human-rights-fears-idUSKCN1G8060&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;easier access to its customers’ data&lt;/a&gt; than when it was stored in the US. The company has also &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/04/09/apple-music-china-removes-jacky-cheung-song-reference-tiananmen-massacre/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disappeared a song&lt;/a&gt; about Tiananmen Square from Apple Music in China and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/media/new-york-times-apps-apple-china.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed the New York Times app&lt;/a&gt; in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given how authentically good Apple is at protecting user privacy, it's very dismaying to see it doing the wrong thing in other areas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given how authentically good Apple is at protecting user privacy, it's very dismaying to see it doing the wrong thing in other areas, especially its relationship with the [Chinese Communist Party],” one former Apple employee told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is not the only US institution to run into controversy trying to maintain its values while remaining in the Chinese government’s good graces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Basketball Association incurred China’s ire when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters this month. Known for their outspokenness, the NBA’s stars largely &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/10/nba-players-coaches-china-reaction-hong-kong-daryl-morey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stayed mum&lt;/a&gt; on the issue, a reporter was &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/houston-rockets-shut-down-reporter-asking-players-about-nba-china-n1064761&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; when asking about it, and fans were &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/hong-kong-nba-fans-signs-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kicked out of arenas&lt;/a&gt; for bringing in messaging supporting the protests. Google, meanwhile, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-pulls-hong-kong-cop-tracking-map-app-after-china-uproar-11570681464&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed a game&lt;/a&gt; in which users could play as Hong Kong protesters from its Play Store. And game maker Blizzard faced a boycott after it &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/blizzard-boycott-hong-kong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspended a player&lt;/a&gt; who supported Hong Kong protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Tim Cook tried to explain away its actions this week by saying protesters were using HKmap.live to “maliciously to target individual officers for violence” without providing evidence, even longtime Apple observer and blogger John Gruber, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/10/cook-hkmap-live-email&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;couldn’t stomach it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny,” Gruber wrote. “For a company that usually measures umpteen times before cutting anything, it’s both sad and startling.”&lt;/p&gt;
