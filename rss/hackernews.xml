<title>CBD and hemp are now legal in the U.S</title>
<link>https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628988.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628988.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 was signed into law. Among other things, this new law changes certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (&lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa L.&lt;/em&gt;), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes include removing hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it will no longer be an illegal substance under federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important for the FDA and our commitment to protect and promote the public health is what the law &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; change: Congress explicitly preserved the agency’s current authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;amp;C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In doing so, Congress recognized the agency’s important public health role with respect to all the products it regulates. This allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re aware of the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including cannabidiol (CBD). This increasing public interest in these products makes it even more important with the passage of this law for the FDA to clarify its regulatory authority over these products. In short, we treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as we do any other FDA-regulated products — meaning they’re subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance. This is true regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Agriculture Improvement Act. To help members of the public understand how the FDA’s requirements apply to these products, the FDA has maintained a &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm421168.htm&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; with answers to frequently asked questions, which we intend to update moving forward to address questions regarding the Agriculture Improvement Act and regulation of these products generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the proliferation of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived substances, the FDA will advance new steps to better define our public health obligations in this area. We’ll also continue to closely scrutinize products that could pose risks to consumers. Where we believe consumers are being put at risk, the FDA will warn consumers and take enforcement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we continue to be concerned at the number of drug claims being made about products not approved by the FDA that claim to contain CBD or other cannabis-derived compounds. Among other things, the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. This is the same standard to which we hold any product marketed as a drug for human or animal use. Cannabis and cannabis-derived products claiming in their marketing and promotional materials that they’re intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases (such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, psychiatric disorders and diabetes) are considered new drugs or new animal drugs and must go through the FDA drug approval process for human or animal use before they are marketed in the U.S. Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective. This deceptive marketing of unproven treatments raises significant public health concerns, as it may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it’s unlawful under the FD&amp;amp;C Act to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. This is because both CBD and THC are active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs and were the subject of substantial clinical investigations before they were marketed as foods or dietary supplements. Under the FD&amp;amp;C Act, it’s illegal to introduce drug ingredients like these into the food supply, or to market them as dietary supplements. This is a requirement that we apply across the board to food products that contain substances that are active ingredients in any drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll take enforcement action needed to protect public health against companies illegally selling cannabis and cannabis-derived products that can put consumers at risk and are being marketed in violation of the FDA’s authorities. The FDA has sent &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm484109.htm&quot;&gt;warning letters&lt;/a&gt; in the past to companies illegally selling CBD products that claimed to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer. Some of these products were in further violation of the FD&amp;amp;C Act because they were marketed as dietary supplements or because they involved the addition of CBD to food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds remain subject to the FDA’s authorities and requirements, there are pathways available for those who seek to lawfully introduce these products into interstate commerce. The FDA will continue to take steps to make the pathways for the lawful marketing of these products more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pathways include ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market with therapeutic claims a human or animal drug that is derived from cannabis. For example, in June 2018, the FDA approved a drug, &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm611046.htm&quot;&gt;Epidiolex&lt;/a&gt;, that contains cannabis-derived CBD for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. That approval was based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, which gives prescribers confidence in the drug’s uniform strength and consistent delivery that support appropriate dosing needed for treating patients with these complex and serious epilepsy syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, pathways remain available for the FDA to consider whether there are circumstances in which certain cannabis-derived compounds might be permitted in a food or dietary supplement. Although such products are generally prohibited to be introduced in interstate commerce, the FDA has authority to issue a regulation allowing the use of a pharmaceutical ingredient in a food or dietary supplement. We are taking new steps to evaluate whether we should pursue such a process. However, the FDA would only consider doing so if the agency were able to determine that all other requirements in the FD&amp;amp;C Act are met, including those required for food additives or new dietary ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that some foods are derived from parts of the hemp plant that may not contain CBD or THC, meaning that their addition to foods might not raise the same issues as the addition of drug ingredients like CBD and THC. We are able to advance the lawful marketing of three such ingredients today. We are announcing that the agency has completed our evaluation of three &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/Food/NewsEvents/ConstituentUpdates/ucm628910.htm&quot;&gt;Generally Recognized as Safe&lt;/a&gt; (GRAS) notices related to hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil and that the agency had no questions regarding the company’s conclusion that the use of such products as described in the notices is safe. Therefore, these products can be legally marketed in human foods for these uses without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make disease treatment claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the substantial public interest in this topic and the clear interest of Congress in fostering the development of appropriate hemp products, we intend to hold a public meeting in the near future for stakeholders to share their experiences and challenges with these products, including information and views related to the safety of such products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use this meeting to gather additional input relevant to the lawful pathways by which products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds can be marketed, and how we can make these legal pathways more predictable and efficient. We’ll also solicit input relevant to our regulatory strategy related to existing products, while we continue to evaluate and take action against products that are being unlawfully marketed and create risks for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we recognize the potential opportunities that cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds could offer and acknowledge the significant interest in these possibilities. We’re committed to pursuing an efficient regulatory framework for allowing product developers that meet the requirements under our authorities to lawfully market these types of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>At Blind, a security lapse revealed private complaints from tech employees</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/blind-anonymous-app-data-exposure/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/blind-anonymous-app-data-exposure/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;featured__span-first-words&quot;&gt;Thousands of people&lt;/span&gt; trusted Blind, an app-based “anonymous social network,” as a safe way to reveal malfeasance, wrongdoing and improper conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/10/hr-has-lost-the-trust-of-employees-here-is-who-has-it-now/&quot;&gt;at their companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Blind left one of its database servers exposed without a password, making it possible for anyone who knew where to look to access each user’s account information and identify would-be whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korea-founded company made its way into the U.S. in 2015, when it quickly became a highly popular anonymous social network for major tech companies, touting employees from Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Uber, and more. Blind last month secured &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1651006/000165100618000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml&quot;&gt;another $10 million&lt;/a&gt; in new funding after a $6 million raise in 2017. But it was only when the social network became the root of several high profile scandals when Blind gained mainstream attention, including revealing allegations of sexual harassment at Uber — which later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/blind-anonymous-chat-app-once-banned-by-uber-expanding-funding-round-2017-5&quot;&gt;blocked the app&lt;/a&gt; on its corporate network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exposed server was found by a security researcher, who goes by the name Mossab H, who informed the company of the security lapse. The security researcher found one of the company’s Kibana dashboard for its backend ElasticSearch database, which contained several tables, including private messaging data and web-based content, for both of its U.S. and Korean sites. Blind said that the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to “a single server, one among many servers on our platform,” according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The company began emailing its users on Thursday after we asked for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While developing an internal tool to improve our service for our users, we became aware of an error that exposed user data,” the email to affected users said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim said that there is “no evidence” that the database was misappropriated or misused, but did not say how it came to that conclusion. When asked, the company would not say if it will notify U.S. state regulators of the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind’s chief executive Sunguk Moon, who was copied on many of the emails with TechCrunch, did not comment or acknowledge the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, the app and anonymous social network allows users to sign up using their corporate email address, which is said to be linked only to Blind’s member ID. Email addresses are “only used for verification” to allow users to talk to other anonymous people in their company, and the company claims that email addresses aren’t stored on its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after reviewing a portion of the exposed data, some of the company’s claims do not stand up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the database provided a real-time stream of user logins, user posts, comments and other interactions, allowing anyone to read private comments and posts. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members but not their associated email addresses. &lt;em&gt;(Given the highly sensitivity of the data and the privacy of the affected users, we’re not posting data, screenshots or specifics of user content.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.li/NpniG&quot;&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; that its email verification “is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process.” It adds: “This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can’t do it.” Blind claims that the database “does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames,” but we found streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. In our brief review, we didn’t find any content, such as comments or messages, linked to email addresses, just a unique member ID, which could identify a user who posts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many records did, however, contain plaintext email addresses. When other records didn’t store an email address, the record contained the user’s email as an unrecognized encrypted hash — which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database also contained passwords, which were stored as an MD5 hash, a long-outdated algorithm that is nowadays easy to crack. Many of the passwords were quickly unscrambled using readily available tools when we tried. Kim denied this. “We don’t use MD5 for our passwords to store them,” he said. “The MD5 keys were a log and it does not represent how we are managing data. We use more advanced methods like salted hash and SHA2 on securing users’ data in our database.” (Logging in with an email address and unscrambled password would be unlawful, therefore we cannot verify this claim.) That may pose a risk to employees who use the same password on the app as they login to their corporate accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the company’s apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens — the same kind of tokens that recently put &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/microsoft-login-bug-hijack-office-accounts/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/12/facebook-breach/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; accounts at risk. If a malicious actor took and used a token, they could login as that user — effectively removing any anonymity they might have had from the database in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well intentioned as the app may be, the database exposure puts users — who trusted the app to keep their information safe and their identities anonymous — at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t just users, but also employees of some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley, who posts about sexual harassment in the workplace and discussing job offers and workplace culture. Many of those who signed up in the past month include senior executives at major tech companies but don’t realize that their email address — which identifies them — could be sitting plaintext in an exposed database. Some users sent anonymous, private messages in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it likely escaped many that the app they were using — often for relief, for empathy, or as a way to disclose wrongdoing — was almost entirely unencrypted and could be accessed, not only by the app’s employees but also for a time anyone on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China hacked HPE, IBM and then attacked clients</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-hpe-ibm-exclusive-idUSKCN1OJ2OY</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-hpe-ibm-exclusive-idUSKCN1OJ2OY</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hackers working on behalf of China’s Ministry of State Security breached the networks of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and IBM, then used the access to hack into their clients’ computers, according to five sources familiar with the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs for Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. cover the facade of the New York Stock Exchange November 2, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacks were part of a Chinese campaign known as Cloudhopper, which the United States and Britain on Thursday said infected technology service providers in order to steal secrets from their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While cybersecurity firms and government agencies have issued multiple warnings about the Cloudhopper threat since 2017, they have not disclosed the identity of technology companies whose networks were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said it had no evidence that sensitive corporate data had been compromised. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) said it could not comment on the Cloudhopper campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses and governments are increasingly looking to technology companies known as managed service providers (MSPs) to remotely manage their information technology operations, including servers, storage, networking and help-desk support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudhopper targeted MSPs to access client networks and steal corporate secrets from companies around the globe, according to a U.S. federal indictment of two Chinese nationals unsealed on Thursday. Prosecutors did not identify any of the MSPs that were breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both IBM and HPE declined to comment on the specific claims made by the sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IBM has been aware of the reported attacks and already has taken extensive counter-measures worldwide as part of our continuous efforts to protect the company and our clients against constantly evolving threats,” the company said in a statement. “We take responsible stewardship of client data very seriously, and have no evidence that sensitive IBM or client data has been compromised by this threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HPE said in a statement that it had spun out a large managed-services business in a 2017 merger with Computer Sciences Corp that formed a new company, DXC Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The security of HPE customer data is our top priority,” HPE said. “We are unable to comment on the specific details described in the indictment, but HPE’s managed services provider business moved to DXC Technology in connection with HPE’s divestiture of its Enterprise Services business in 2017.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DXC Technology declined to comment, saying in a statement that it does not comment on reports about specific cyber events and hacking groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters was unable to confirm the names of other breached technology firms or identify any affected clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources, who were not authorized to comment on confidential information gleaned from investigations into the hacks, said that HPE and IBM were not the only prominent technology companies whose networks had been compromised by Cloudhopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudhopper, which has been targeting technology services providers for several years, infiltrated the networks of HPE and IBM multiple times in breaches that lasted for weeks and months, according to another of the sources with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM investigated an attack as recently as this summer, and HPE conducted a large breach investigation in early 2017, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attackers were persistent, making it difficult to ensure that networks were safe, said another source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has dealt with some infections by installing new hard drives and fresh operating systems on infected computers, said the person familiar with the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudhopper attacks date back to at least 2014, according the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment cited one case in which Cloudhopper compromised data of an MSP in New York state and clients in 12 countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and the United States. They were from industries including finance, electronics, medical equipment, biotechnology, automotive, mining, and oil and gas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One senior intelligence official, who declined to name any victims who were breached, said attacks on MSPs were a significant threat because they essentially turned technology companies into launchpads for hacks on clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By gaining access to an MSP, you can in many cases gain access to any one of their customers,” said the official. “Call it the Walmart approach: If I needed to get 30 different items for my shopping list, I could go to 15 different stores or I could go to the one that has everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. Officials with the U.S. Justice Department and the Chinese embassy in Washington could not be reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British government spokeswoman declined to comment on the identities of companies affected by the Cloudhopper campaign or the impact of those breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A number of MSPs have been affected, and naming them would have potential commercial consequences for them, putting them at an unfair disadvantage to their competitors,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Gluten Free Antarctica</title>
<link>https://idlewords.com/2018/12/gluten_free_antarctica.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://idlewords.com/2018/12/gluten_free_antarctica.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;12.20.&lt;a class=&quot;date&quot; href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/2018/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;post_title&quot; href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/2018/12/gluten_free_antarctica.htm&quot;&gt;Gluten Free Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far below the Antarctic circle, I watch a woman cry real tears because she can’t get gluten-free toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary is a plummy old English lady traveling alone, an Agatha Christie figure who I expected would spend her time solving mysteries on the ship. When people started disappearing in the Ross Sea, Mary would work the case and gather everyone in the ship’s saloon for the spectacular reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Mary turned out to be a bit of a shipboard bully, bad-talking the other passengers instead of helping to solve their murders. But I am still not ready to see her go to pieces over toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conor, our juvenile delinquent chef, emerges from the galley and drapes himself across the table to soothe her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What can I get you, love?” he coos, “Can I get you an egg?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want an egg.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I get you some bacon?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want bacon. What I want is a second piece of toast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m so sorry, but we don’t have enough for all the gluten-free passengers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her face darkens. “I know for a fact that there are some people who were not gluten-free before they got on this ship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accusation hangs in the air, unanswerable, and Mary starts to cry. These are angry tears, tears that demand gluten-free justice. The single piece of corn toast she has been allotted for breakfast lies mute on her plate, an affront to God and man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodney convenes a summit in the ship’s auditorium to address the gluten crisis. Only passengers with dietary restrictions are invited. The rest of us must huddle around the open hatch one deck above, straining to hear. We are deep in the Ross Sea, five hundred miles from the nearest human being, and this is the most exciting thing that has happened on the ship in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tears of laughter on the bridge when I tell the Russian crew about the Great Antarctic Glutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You mean if this woman eats bread, she will die?“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not really. She just gets sick.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yuri, come here! You have to hear this. If she eats bread, the woman will die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She won’t die. Gluten causes digestive problems for some people. But it’s also become a sort of health fad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is ‘gluten’? Is that even a Russian word?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they’ve got me. Tolstoy never wrote about gluten (&lt;em&gt;kleikovina&lt;/em&gt;), and the ship’s dictionary is strictly nautical. Trying to paraphrase the concept only exposes the holes in my own understanding of this mysterious, flavorful substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s some kind of a protein in grain. I think it makes things taste good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuri makes a skeptical face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t kill anyone,” I insist. “But people can get digestive… unpleasantness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So bread will make her sick?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can she eat potatoes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes. And corn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any hope of sympathy from the Russians evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then let her eat potatoes. Let her eat corn. Or let them all stay home and eat whatever the fuck they want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians are seasick, homesick, and lacking in sympathy for the unique challenges that confront the Antarctic tourist. Repeated trips to the Ross Sea have brought them no closer to understanding why people would pay money—tens of thousands of American dollars!—to stare at ice when they could instead be visiting the big duty-free shops at Busan, or spending a pleasant two weeks fishing off the coast of Sakhalin Island, where the fish practically jump into your net and you can sometimes see bears right on the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has asked the crew if they have nut allergies, gluten sensitivity, hypertension, lactose intolerance, or any other kind of dietary restriction. Their culinary options are to stay home in Vladivostok earning nothing, or get on the ship and eat what they are given. The closest the Russians come to a dietary preference is the battery of hot sauce and condiment bottles that crowds the center of their table at each meal, along with trays of raw onion, garlic, and weapons-grade mustard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation on the bridge soon turns to fish and the best ways of preparing them, and I leave the crew to go lie in my bunk for a while, sliding back and forth in time with the motion of the sea, thinking about gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been at sea for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to eat in Antarctica is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchelli_Station&quot;&gt;Zuchelli&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian research station in Terra Nova Bay (open seasonally, but good luck getting a reservation). Word on the ship on our voyage south was that the Italians have a custom-made espresso machine and pasta maker. They enjoy fresh pasta with little cups of black gold every night. Some on our ship have even dared to whisper of gelato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How profound our heartbreak, then, when we enter the Ross Sea to hear that the Italians are just leaving, their base closed for the winter. We watch the small blip of their supply vessel move north on our radar screen with undisguised sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe the rumors about American scuba divers, there is excellent sashimi to be had on the bottom of McMurdo sound. It's very fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best wine cellar on the continent, of course, is at the French &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumont_d%27Urville_Station&quot;&gt;Dumont d'Urville&lt;/a&gt; station in Adélie Land. It's a little out of the way, but never crowded. The station's pastry chef (!) keeps the fresh eggs covered with a layer of wax to prolong their life, so the crew can enjoy &lt;em&gt;religieuses&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gâteaux St. Honoré&lt;/em&gt; all winter long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst place to be hungry is probably at one of the Russian bases, either Vostok Station on the polar plateau (with its slowly dwindling pyramid of frozen potatoes), or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingshausen_Station&quot;&gt;Bellinghausen Station&lt;/a&gt; on King George Island. The &lt;em&gt;Shokalsiky&lt;/em&gt;'s crew remembers docking at Bellinghausen during a period of severe budget cuts in the 2000's. Forgotten by Moscow, the group of wild-eyed scientists who emerged blinking into the light had been living for months on a diet of canned peas and cabbage. The crew took pity, trading their stores with the beleaguered marine biologists, and then had to subsist on cabbage and peas themselves all the way back up to Vladivostok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their limits. The &lt;em&gt;Shokalskiy&lt;/em&gt; offers gluten-free meals, but the brochure warns us they can’t accomodate kosher or vegan diners. (Keeping meat and milk separate in the tiny galley is impossible, and no one could endure five weeks at sea with a vegan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antarctica, the only continent without a Michelin star, has never been a destination for fine dining. We've all been to the historic huts and seen the ghastly parade of canned Edwardian organ meats, probably no less indedible after a hundred winters on the ice than they were back in 1907. The culinary history of the continent (entertainingly laid out in a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009ND2J2W/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1&quot;&gt;Hoosh&lt;/a&gt;) is one of suffering and deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with passengers paying $20,000 a berth for the voyage, a diet of ship's biscuit and pemmican is not going to cut it. The situation requires a certain degree of finesse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like in any institutional setting, life on the ship starts to revolve around mealtimes. Every day at lunch, Julia, our Russian cruise director, hands out printed table tents announcing the evening's entrees (on one memorable occasion we are promised ‘pork lion’), and anticipation among the passengers starts to build. Will they have the chicken? Or will they have the fish? And what will others be having?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At five thirty, Julia comes on the PA to announce the cocktail hour, and the highly trained naturalists and historians on the Heritage Expeditions staff assemble behind the bar to mix gin and tonics. This is the one hour of the day when you can buy alcohol on the ship, and for the less sociable, it's a Sophie's choice. Do you come out and spend an extra hour with the people who are driving you to drink in the first place? Or do you abstain so you can hide in your bunk until the last minute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship has a small wine list, which the passengers scrutinize into the waning days of the voyage as if this were &lt;em&gt;La Tour d’Argent&lt;/em&gt; rather than an aging Soviet oceanographic vessel. There is a system where you can buy a bottle of wine that gets labeled with your cabin number and brought down for you at dinner by the lecturer on cetacean biology, or more satisfyingly (since he’s French) the ship’s expert on birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship has two dining rooms, laid out to port and starboard like the wings of a butterfly, with a narrow galley in the thorax. Each dining room has four tables with stools bolted to the floor. The tables are covered with a grippy plastic mesh that loses its hold, one quickly learns, when the ship rolls past forty degrees. We become adept at judging the angle of the water in the transparent pitchers to know when it’s time to grab our plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The galley is shared between the two New Zealand chefs and Annabel, the Russian cook, who is old enough to be their mother. Early in the voyage, Conor attempts to tease Annabel by drawing a cock and balls in the water droplets on one of her saucepan lids. Annabel breaks into tears and locks herself in her cabin. The Russians are scandalized. That evening, the Chief Mate materializes in the galley, a space barely large enough to contain him, and holds his large fist in front of Conor's nose, turning it like a ham on a spit, until the language barrier is overcome. There are no further pranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meals are served by our two Russian waitresses, Tatyana and Lyudmila, or Tatty Anna and Lewd Meala to the New Zealanders. Lyudmila is an almost inaudibly bashful young woman of 20 with extravagantly long black hair, who has a secret identity as a second-year merchant marine cadet, qualifying to become Third Mate on the ship. She serves potato consomme and then goes up to help avoid icebergs on the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanya is a tiny and not at all bashful Siberian woman in her thirties who is pitiless with those who waste her time, which is every passenger on this dawdling ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My relationship with Tanya has warmed since I &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/2016/05/shuffleboard_at_mcmurdo.htm&quot;&gt;procured a Zippo lighter for her&lt;/a&gt; at McMurdo station. In compliance with the terms of our pact, she now brings me two slices of the delicious Russian bread every morning at breakfast. (When the other passengers ask about it, I tell them it’s a special dietary bread, with added gluten.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mealtimes drag on. The kind of people interested enough in Antarctic history to spend five weeks at sea are not what you would call easy mixers. Within the first few days we have exhausted our share of small talk and origin stories. There is no news from the outside world. All we can discuss is what's on our plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealanders seem to have an almost pathological fear of flavor. There is no dish so bland that Conor can’t find a way to tone it down. At one point he serves us a tikka masala that I am pretty certain is just a blend of yogurt and ketchup. I watch disbelieving as the passengers around me fan their mouths. “That’s got a bit of a kick, yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another occasion I sit across from Danting, our lone Chinese passenger, and watch him entomb a microwaved fish fillet in a sarcophagus of black pepper. I think back to the Sichuan fish I used to eat in China, brought out sizzling in a tub full of red oil and chilies, the fish's head bobbing among a riot of green onions and peppercorns. Danting just wants to feel something, anything, approaching flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most enjoyable meal on the ship, when the wind is up, is the buffet breakfast. I like to come down early to watch the carnage. You can’t tell just by looking at an elderly person who will have good balance—they will surprise you. Ken is in his eighties and has bad knees, but I have never seen him tip a plate or lose a drop of tea as he slaloms towards his seat in the rolling waves. The fit American couple in their fifties, on the other hand, can't keep their feet even in a mild gale, and will fling their eggs into the porthole every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasickness thins our ranks. About a third of the passengers elect to stay in their cabins on the bad days, eating crackers in their bunk if they can keep them down. The Ross Sea is docile, but the Southern Ocean—a week in both directions—is not. The travel brochure plays down this aspect of the voyage, but I think this is a mistake. It should be a selling point: “Eat all you want and still lose weight!” When I make the suggestion to Rodney, he gives me another one of those looks that makes me suspect this will be my last voyage on a Heritage Expeditions vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite breakfast passenger is Bill, who has been married for 50 years and is a man of habit. His wife sits at the furthest table and waits for him to bring the tea. He fills both mugs to the rim, times his run so the ship is just level, and then shuffles forward, screaming, as the boiling liquid scalds his hands. Every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a strict culinary apartheid on the ship. On other ships on the polar circuit, there will sometimes be a mixer where passengers and crew have a chance to eat together, to lessen the awkwardness of sharing a confined space for a prolonged period of time across a language barrier. A popular favorite for these mixers is &lt;em&gt;pelmeni&lt;/em&gt;, which are labor intensive and fun to make together. But on this ship, we do not mix, and there is no fun, and no &lt;em&gt;pelmeni&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russians eat before we do. They sit according to rank, with the captain and officers at one table, the midshipmen and engineers at the second, and regular sailors at the third. Each table has its big tureen of soup, steadied by a cork ring. For the main course, Annabel serves out some variation on meat, cabbage, and potatoes. The real action is in the condiments, whose cosmopolitan diversity tells the story of the ship's many equatorial crossings. There is off-brand sriracha, soy sauce, fish sauce from Thailand, and a number of mystery bottles labeled in Thai, Chinese or Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every table also has a pitcher of fruit compote, the signature beverage of the Russian sailor, whose other signature beverage is strictly forbidden by order of the captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meals for the crew are brief and silent, except for the ritual “&lt;em&gt;priyatnovo appetita&lt;/em&gt;” when someone new comes in and sits down. Sailors arrive, eat their meal, and move on, all within a half-hour window. It's dreamy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Conor catches me having supper with the Russians, my mouth full of herring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You don’t like my cooking, do you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the stuff I grew up on. It’s comfort food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He accepts this and leans towards me in a confiding way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I ask you something? How come the Russians never smile? I’ve never seen them smiling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re at work. They're Russians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it normal for them to eat without talking to one another?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is their job. They get 20 minutes to eat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but they never smile. Are they happy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the Russians happy? Is anyone happy? Can one ever truly be said to be happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tempted to go full Slav on Conor, to explain to him how we are all just grains of dust suspended in the howling void, searching for meaning in the fleeting moments before we are yanked back to the oblivion from whence we emerged, naked and screaming. But for all his faults he's just a kid stuck spending his summer microwaving Yorkshire puddings for difficult people. I take pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Russians are formal. It would be weird of them to act relaxed on duty. They are all smiling on the inside.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening, after I have spent my dinner hour on the bridge talking to the Chief Mate, he invites me down to the secret snack room in the back of the ship. This is the ship’s culinary &lt;em&gt;el dorado&lt;/em&gt;, the fabled place where Russian and New Zealand leftovers co-exist side by side. We know this place exists, but until now, no passenger has entered it. I spy my uneaten dinner in a big aluminum tray on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A television in the corner plays Russian cartoons, and there’s an urn of boiling water for tea strapped to the wall. It is a peaceful, happy place, a refuge for sailors who are on watch during regular mealtimes and have to eat at odd hours. In the ship's former life, this room served as its laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come here whenever you want,” the Chief Mate says, “but don’t let Rodney catch you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take the warning to heart. Rodney roams the ship like a hungry ghost, appearing in unexpected places, foraging for snacks. As the owner of the company, no part of the ship is off limits to him. While he has not said anything about my fraternizing with the crew, a tranquil, fatherly joy is conspicuously absent from his face whenever he sees me. I have no desire to provoke him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodney has an odd, adversarial relationship with food. He eats with a joyless intensity, as if it had done him a personal wrong. Conor has begun to perform experiments on him at dinner, seeing how big a plate of food he can get the great man to eat without comment. Every night the staff watches rapt as a more and more comical portion is set at the head of the table, and every night they watch it disappear into Rodney's beard. So far they have found no limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wall of the snack room is hung with an enormous, menacing map of the far south Atlantic labeled in Cyrillic. Across from it there is a corkboard tiled with faxed messages of support from an episode I’ve been obsessed with since I learned the name of the ship we would be sailing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain of the &lt;em&gt;Xue Long&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you thank you thank you for your help to evacuate us from the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt safe, protected, and cared for by your crew. Thank you for your strength, kindness, and bravery to help us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Judy S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain, &lt;em&gt;Akademik Shokalskiy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Igor,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for the care and competence of you and all your crew during our stay on your ship. We are very grateful for the degree of technical skills and professionalism displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the crew of the &lt;em&gt;Xue Long&lt;/em&gt;. Many thanks for your efforts in extracting us from the beset &lt;em&gt;Shokalskiy&lt;/em&gt;. I was very impressed with your professionalism and efficiency. Hope you are able to get free soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts are with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Captain Igor and the most amazing crew of the &lt;em&gt;Akademik Shokalskiy&lt;/em&gt;, I cannot thank you enough for your dedication, committment and professionalism. You made our brief stay on the ship feel like home and we will miss you like family. We hope for your safe and speedy return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are all heroes to me. Thank you for taking risks for me. Good luck for a quick rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This note is to express my heartfelt thanks and deep appreciation to your entire ship's company for your tireless and selfless efforts to facilitate our successful rescue which was achieved only with your wonderful KA32 helicopter and professional crew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing you West Winds and swift release,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from Elizabeth W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notes date from an episode in the austral winter of 2013-14 when the &lt;em&gt;Akademik Shokalskiy&lt;/em&gt;, chartered by an Australian scientist, got stuck in the ice off the coast of East Antarctica. The stranding made international headlines and set off an expensive rescue effort, which in turn led to a lot of debate about the role of adventure travel in the Antarctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passengers, a mix of scientists and tourists, were evacuated by helicopter without incident. The crew were left behind on the ship. While no one was hurt, the expensive rescue not only jeopardized the winter's scientific program at the Australian research station, whose resupply ship had to put to sea to answer the distress call, but it left the Australians without any booze for their New Year's party. There are some wounds that can never heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this stranding is like Rashomon, except that no one disagrees on the facts, just their interpretation. The stranded passengers seemed to be having a pretty good time, posting YouTube videos of sing-alongs, bikini selfies, and holding a writers' workshop on the ice. To the skeptical and involuntarily sober eyes of the research community, this scientific expedition looked a lot like a party ship. The organizer blamed the misadventure on a freak weather event, but many questioned his judgement in making such a hazardous landing, and in bringing his two young children with him. No one could seem to agree just how much danger the ship had been in, or how close East Antarctica had come to a major oil spill had the ship been crushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the fiasco got international press attention, including live updates from the three reporters on the ship, no one besides the Russian press seems to have asked the crew about it. Many of the sailors on my voyage were on the &lt;em&gt;Shokalskiy&lt;/em&gt; during that curious episode and I am dying to hear their side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Mary, the most obvious candidate for a shipboard detective, now sidelined by &lt;em&gt;l’affaire gluten&lt;/em&gt;, I feel the investigative burden has fallen on my own shoulders. So like a spy, I photograph the corkboard, fill my pockets with leftovers, and (after peeking out to see if Rodney is coming) step out manfully into the corridor in search of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On a sunny summer day in Montauk, Ipek Irgit was in the familiar situation of not knowing what she was doing with her life. It was 2012, and she was 34 years old. Earlier in the year, after having her heart broken, she had taken a vacation in Brazil, visiting Rio de Janeiro and the beach towns of Bahia. Now she was on the beach on Long Island, wearing a handmade-looking bikini with crochet and exposed elastic straps, trying to figure out what to do and who to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It had been 11 unsettled years since Ms. Irgit moved from Turkey to New York, with $300 in her pocket and a vague dream of making a life in one of the city’s creative industries. She became part of a downtown class of trendsetters who all seemed to have a purpose. It was an expensive existence, especially for Ms. Irgit, who, without the cushion of a trust fund, bounced from job to job. She was a waitress and a bartender; she worked for a fashion company as an assistant to a merchandiser and in the wholesale department. Nothing stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On the Montauk sand, Ms. Irgit was playing paddle ball with a friend, the restaurateur &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sergebecker/top/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Serge Becker&lt;/a&gt;, when he complimented her striking bikini. As Ms. Irgit would later put it, this was the spark that motivated her to start a business. Why not create more of these distinctive bathing suits? Why not become a bikini-maker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Irgit looked at the bathing suit and saw untapped “superpowers.” It was bright, colorful and looked fantastic on Instagram. Its tiny form contained an unexpected array of elements: triangular panels; contrast-color stitching; and most distinctively of all, those vibrant elastic straps threaded through loops of crochet. The suit had a D.I.Y. sensibility popular on both the internet and the runway, and Ms. Irgit hoped buyers would see it as sexy but sporty, bohemian but sophisticated. “A reflection,” she said, “of my personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Irgit asked a friend in the fashion industry to create a prototype, and a factory in China made a batch at a cost of about $29 each. Ms. Irgit decided to mark up the retail price to $285, putting her suit into the high-end luxury market. She paid careful attention to branding, playing around with “bikini” and her initials — I.I.I. — before settling on “Kiini” and a logo with three triangles over the “i”s, like the panels on the top and bottom of her suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In June 2013, Kiini had its launch party at a buzzy restaurant owned by Mr. Becker. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pg/KiiniSwim/photos/?tab=album&amp;amp;album_id=142676822603040&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Models, stylists&lt;/a&gt; and other denizens of the beautiful-people set sipped Caribbean beer and posed for photos with Ms. Irgit, who wore bright lipstick and a pilot-style jumpsuit unbuttoned nearly to the navel, revealing her Kiini top beneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Sales were unremarkable until January, when Ms. Irgit’s product got its first significant &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/i3_rLhLh08/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;amp;igshid=1i009e25058x&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Instagram plug&lt;/a&gt;. The model Dree Hemingway posed provocatively by a surfboard in a bikini with dark panels and green-and-orange detailing. She captioned: “Thank you for my Kiini!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I was, like, bombarded,” Ms. Irgit said. “That was it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The bikini was featured on Vogue.com, and in Vogue UK and Women’s Health magazine. There were Elle Italia, the style magazine of The Sunday Times of London, the Coveteur. In June 2014, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://kiini.com/blogs/news/14787509-people-magazine&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt; magazine called it “the hottest bikini this summer.” That December, it appeared on the U.K. cover of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://kiini.com/blogs/news/17015548-conde-nast-traveller-uk-cover-with-reka-ebergenyi-december-2014&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Condé Nast Traveller&lt;/a&gt;. A few months later, the company announced that the bikini was available at &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://kiini.com/blogs/news/17015968-kiini-at-barneys&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barneys&lt;/a&gt;, the Valhalla of upscale boutique brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Sales were exploding. By 2015, Ms. Irgit’s suit had brought in approximately $9 million, said Sally Wu, who for years helped the company source its bikinis from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As is often the case in fashion, Kiini’s success drew copycats. Ms. Irgit complained about it to her lawyer, who advised her to apply with the United States Copyright Office for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Irgit came to regard knockoff makers with rage. She seethed when confronted by Instagram images erroneously referring to impostor Kiinis as the real article, and even hired a company to scrub such posts of the #kiini hashtag. Ms. Irgit &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thelifestyleedit.com/kiini-swimwear-designer-ipek-irgit/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told a lifestyle website&lt;/a&gt; that “one of my big challenges has been trying to keep up with demand without losing integrity and hiring the right people to help without panicking. My biggest challenge right now is the copiers around the world. People say I should be flattered but I despise all of them. It just shows a very ugly face of humanity to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-3938f185&quot;&gt;The tiniest two-piece can hide a lot of secrets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In fashion, there is a fine, sometimes indistinguishable line separating inspiration and theft. Most apparel companies try not to get distracted by items that are derivative of their own. The trend cycle moves so quickly that experts tend to believe the best use of resources isn’t litigation, but creating next season’s styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Irgit, though, could not abide the idea of rival versions of colorful crocheted bikinis. In 2015, she was particularly inflamed by the introduction of a faux-Kiini made by Victoria’s Secret. That October, in the central district of California, her lawyers filed a federal lawsuit accusing the company of copyright infringement. It called for Victoria’s Secret to stop selling the swimwear and pay damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The lawsuit was a mismatch — teeny Kiini versus vast Victoria — but Ms. Irgit was scrappy. At one point, she surreptitiously recorded a meeting with a former Victoria’s Secret swimwear designer. Then Kiini’s lawyers deposed the designer; when her testimony contradicted what was on the secret tape, they played it back for her, making for a dramatic and embarrassing moment. As the litigation dragged on, Victoria’s Secret decided to get out of the swimwear business altogether, and by March 2017 the company and Kiini had agreed to a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/kiini-victorias-secret-settle-swimsuit-infringement-lawsuit&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;confidential settlement&lt;/a&gt;. (Victoria’s Secret declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Irgit felt victorious. A year later, in April 2018, Kiini filed another federal lawsuit, this time in the Southern District of New York, against Neiman Marcus and two swimwear companies. It accused them of unfair competition, misleading consumers about the origin of the swimsuits and violating Kiini’s “trade dress.” In lay terms, Kiini was saying that any consumer in the world who saw a crocheted-and-exposed-elastic bikini would assume it was a Kiini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For an upstart brand, one lawsuit was rare. A second was unheard of. Kiini’s litigiousness brought Ms. Irgit unwanted attention — and revealed that even the tiniest two-piece can hide a lot of secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One day in August, Ms. Irgit greeted me at a loft in Tribeca, a large and airy space that serves both as her home and as Kiini’s showroom and office. We sat at a long, rectangular kitchen table that separates the living area and the work space. It is a point of pride for Ms. Irgit that she used her own marketing savvy to develop Kiini’s high profile without the use of a publicist, but our interview took place under specific conditions negotiated by Risa Heller, a crisis communications consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As we spoke, Ms. Irgit shared her disdain for the legal process — a hatred of lawsuits and a belief that it is lawyers who benefit the most from them. It was the creative process she most cherished, she said. She meandered, though, when I asked her repeatedly to talk about inventing the Kiini. Did she sketch it? How did she come up with the idea of threading elastic through crochet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It goes back to with my grandmother,” Ms. Irgit said, in her most specific answer. “We used to make things like crochet bikinis, so I was like 10 and 11.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“You made crochet bikinis when you were 10?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Not me, I’m not making them, right?” Ms. Irgit said. “No, ‘make’ is like — it is usually my idea. I’m not that — I didn’t make them. My mom made it, or my grandma made it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;What about the bathing suit Ms. Irgit was wearing on the beach in Montauk in 2012 with Mr. Becker? Who made it? “I had had it made,” was all Ms. Irgit would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I called Mr. Becker, her paddle ball partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He remembered the moment well. “She was wearing it,” Mr. Becker said. “I noticed it and I said it was really cool. She told me she had found them in Brazil and was contemplating starting to do something with it in different varieties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-2904e28f&quot;&gt;‘I created this bikini to survive’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Maria Solange Ferrarini lives in Trancoso, a beach town in Brazil’s Bahia state, along a dirt road littered with garbage and stray animals. When I walked up to her tidy four-room home one day this summer, she greeted me dressed in crocheted shorts with brightly colored elastics woven through them. Under a sleeveless T-shirt, she wore a similar bikini top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Inside, as we talked with the help of a translator, Ms. Ferrarini picked up a ball of yarn stuck through with a needle. She had a habit of grabbing it and crocheting absent-mindedly, holding it almost like a rosary, as she told her story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Ms. Ferrarini at home in Trancoso, Brazil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dado Galdieri for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Ferrarini, 61, described herself as a street artist, but most people in Trancoso know her as the bikini lady. Since 1998, she has been selling handmade crochet-and-elastic bikinis on the beach, walking up and down the sand with her creations dangling off a hula hoop. She and the suit are inseparable. “It’s my husband,” she said, with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I looked at one of the bikinis in her living room. Ms. Ferrarini’s standard two-piece has two dark denim triangles connected by visible stitches of embroidery thread to crochet straps with brightly colored elastics woven through them. The bottom is made to match. It is virtually identical to the bikini Ms. Irgit had copyrighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I created this bikini to survive,” Ms. Ferrarini said. She was born in São Carlos, a university city outside São Paulo, where her father was a bricklayer and her mother was a seamstress. When she was 10, her mother taught her to crochet so that she could make clothes for herself and her younger sisters. Around 1994, she moved to Trancoso, took a room in a guesthouse, and tried to make money with her craft. She crocheted thong bikini bottoms and sold them by pacing the beach. It was nudist, though, and that created a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;To get back to the guesthouse at the end of the day, Ms. Ferrarini had to pass a seaside church. As a Catholic, she didn’t feel right walking by in just a thong, with her breasts exposed. In reverence, she added a handmade, curtain-like top that draped over her chest. The design evolved into a bikini top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When Ms. Ferrarini realized she needed more support than yarn could provide, she began to thread elastics through the crochet to give a little lift. Other women quickly took note. They asked her to make tops for them, too. Initially, she sold the bikinis for the equivalent of $2.50. She increased the price by about $5 every couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Trancoso tourist economy was gaining steam by 2009. That year, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vogue.com/article/vd-blame-it-on-trancoso&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt; called it “Brazil’s hottest beach town,” reporting that it was a favorite of no less an authority on sandy outposts than the Brazilian supergoddess Gisele Bündchen. It was the sort of beach that famous people and other fashionable types sought out. In the winter of 2012, the Daily Mail published photos of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2095960/Kelly-Brook-pours-curves-swimwear-purchased-beach-vendor-Brazil.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;British celebrity Kelly Brook&lt;/a&gt; on the beach in Trancoso, wearing one of Ms. Ferrarini’s bikinis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It was around that time that the town was visited by another trendsetter: Ipek Irgit. She confirmed the visit during our interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Before I left Trancoso, I accompanied Ms. Ferrarini on a sales walk along the beach. She arranged a sale to a woman from California, and then sold a top to another tourist, from Canada, who mentioned she’d seen the same style “all over the place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Ferrarini sighed. She was used to that, she said, but it still stung. To her, an artist, it is about creative integrity. “I’d see people in bikinis, and foreigners doubted that I was the creator,” she said. “They said the bikini was from the United States. To my face!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-74aa585e&quot;&gt;‘Listen, Ipek, I’m not going to lie’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Sally Wu was happy on the day in mid-2012 when her friend, Ms. Irgit, contacted her to ask a favor. Earlier in the year she had been traveling in Brazil, she said, and was home with a new bikini. Ms. Wu said that Ms. Irgit told her, “I need to figure out how to copy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Wu was a good person to ask. Raised in Shanghai, she had moved to New York and become a fashion designer, then segued into the industry’s “private label” niche, working as a product developer and bilingual liaison between brands and Chinese manufacturers. She understood design, production and importing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Ms. Wu’s recollection, Ms. Irgit brought a bikini to her Chinatown apartment and laid it on a couch. Ms. Wu saw that the suit, particularly the top, would be more complex to reconstruct than a layman might imagine. It would be tricky for yarn, for instance, to maintain its structure and color while being regularly submerged in water. And the unlined fabric would need to be a certain thickness, or else it would be see-through. She walked Ms. Irgit through each step of the replication process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“She is not a designer,” Ms. Wu said of Ms. Irgit this summer, as we sat on the back terrace of her current home, in East Harlem. “But she is a good marketer. She knows how to create a brand, and she really knows how to market a product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;After their initial consultation, Ms. Wu asked Ms. Irgit to send her a document of specs that Ms. Wu could relay to a Chinese manufacturer. Ms. Irgit sent the email on July 28, 2012. “Sally darling,” it began, and referred Ms. Wu to attached photos, with measurements and colors annotated. Ms. Irgit signed it “xo i.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Working with the factory, Ms. Wu helped to create a prototype. Ms. Irgit loved it, and asked for 300 more. Ms. Wu was worried about such a large order; if they didn’t sell, Ms. Irgit would be out a lot of money. But the Kiinis did sell — and sell and sell. What started as a favor for Ms. Irgit became a major time commitment. “Even in winter, we were shipping to Australia, shipping to Europe, shipping to New York,” Ms. Wu said. Ms. Irgit was crazed trying to manage the commercial demand and the press attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The two women were consumed by work, and their relationship was fraying. Ms. Wu urged Ms. Irgit to expand her brand beyond a single motif. She made suggestions that Ms. Irgit ridiculed. Given the frostiness, Ms. Wu was surprised, she said, to get a phone call from Ms. Irgit one night in the late summer of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;The note Ms. Irgit wrote to Sally Wu during the Victoria’s Secret litigation. It reads: “If Kiini LLC wins the VS case Ipek is treating” — the penmanship is imprecise and the word “treating” might be “hosting” or “having” — “Sally ChaCha and 3 optional friends on holiday anywhere in the world!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Can I come over?” Ms. Irgit asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;About a half-hour later, she arrived. She was nearly a year into litigation with Victoria’s Secret, and she explained that in the discovery process, lawyers for Victoria’s Secret had learned that Ms. Wu had a hand in Kiini’s production. Victoria’s Secret had given Ms. Irgit’s lawyers advance notice that Ms. Wu was going to receive a subpoena for a deposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Wu said she clearly recalled what Ms. Irgit said next. “She’s like, ‘You can’t really tell them I copied.’ I said, ‘Listen, Ipek, I’m not going to lie.’” (Ms. Irgit disputed Ms. Wu’s recollection. “It’s a lie,” she said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The two women talked some more. Ms. Wu was upset about getting pulled into a legal mess. Ms. Irgit was worried about how the drama could impact Kiini’s production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Before Ms. Irgit departed, Ms. Wu said, Ms. Irgit wrote a note on a yellow sticky pad. It read, “If Kiini LLC wins the VS case Ipek is treating” — the penmanship is imprecise and the word “treating” might be “hosting” or “having” — “Sally ChaCha and 3 optional friends on holiday anywhere in the world!” (Cha Cha was a nickname for Ms. Wu’s daughter.) She signed it “Ipek,” underlining her name in a flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Wu said she never received a subpoena. The next year, Victoria’s Secret settled the lawsuit with Kiini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;By April 2018, around the time that Kiini sued Neiman Marcus, Ms. Wu and Ms. Irgit’s friendship and business arrangement had totally deteriorated. They had a blistering fight over email, with each woman impugning the other’s integrity, and Ms. Wu stopped working with Kiini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Not long after, Ms. Wu had dinner with a friend, an entrepreneur named Doug Schmidt. She told him the whole story about her work with Ms. Irgit: replicating that first Brazilian bikini, the copyright, the lawsuits. Mr. Schmidt told Ms. Wu that he had friends at Neiman Marcus. He bet they’d want to hear her story, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-76698161&quot;&gt;The lawyer zoomed in. He zoomed again. Then he saw it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Jason Forge was for years a federal prosecutor in United States attorney’s offices in California, going after &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/04/politics/excongressman-gets-8year-term-in-bribery-case.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;dirty politicians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/12/washington/career-cia-figure-is-at-eye-of-scandal.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;corrupt C.I.A. officials&lt;/a&gt;. Now he is in private practice; in his most notable case, he represented students in a class action &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/us/trump-university-settlement.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;against Trump University&lt;/a&gt;, winning them $25 million. Also, Mr. Forge is married to an owner of a swimwear supplier called PilyQ, which makes a crochet suit that looks a lot like a Kiini. Under a brand called Platinum, PilyQ has for some time been selling that suit to Neiman Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Ms. Ferrarini signs each of her bikinis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dado Galdieri for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In April, lawyers for Kiini sent Neiman Marcus a letter urging it to cease and desist selling swimwear from brands including Platinum. Neiman Marcus notified PilyQ, Platinum’s parent, and Mr. Forge started digging on PilyQ’s behalf. He got in touch with lawyers involved in the Victoria’s Secret litigation and heard rumors of an unacknowledged bikini maker in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Online, he found a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IP3P21lAIY&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; made by a friend of Ms. Ferrarini’s in 2016 that displayed her phone number. Mr. Forge reached Ms. Ferrarini, who consulted with a lawyer, and quickly negotiated a nonexclusive deal. In May, in exchange for using her crochet-and-elastic design and her name, PilyQ paid Ms. Ferrarini the equivalent of about $5,100. (In January 2019, she’ll get an annual fee of about $7,700.) Neiman Marcus and other major retailers now sell a suit under the name &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/platinum-inspired-by-solange-ferrarini-crochet-trim-triangle-swim-top-available-in-d-cup-magenta-and-matching-items-prod208570035?childItemId=NMTWL7Y_&amp;amp;focusProductId=prod207270235&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Platinum Inspired by Solange Ferrarini”&lt;/a&gt; for about $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This summer, Mr. Forge was thrilled to learn from someone at Neiman Marcus that there was a woman named Sally Wu who had worked with Ms. Irgit from the beginning. Mr. Forge met Ms. Wu for a drink and got her story. She subsequently emailed him a photo of the yellow sticky note with Ms. Irgit’s signed offer. She also agreed to give Mr. Forge access to data from her old hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Within days, he was looking at the “Sally darling” email Ms. Irgit sent to Ms. Wu some six years earlier, with photographs of the bikini she wished the Chinese producers to use as a reference for her prototype. On his computer, Mr. Forge scrutinized the pictures for details. One image was of the bikini bottom turned inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Forge zoomed in. He zoomed again. Then he saw it. “I could not believe my eyes,” Mr. Forge told me. On the elastic, in marker, was a phone number, the words “Trancoso, B.A.” and the signature of Solange Ferrarini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eqpy7av0&quot; id=&quot;link-62fb8f18&quot;&gt;‘If true, it’s breathtaking’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In May 2018, as Mr. Forge was conducting his work, Kiini amended its lawsuit against Neiman Marcus to formally add PilyQ, Bloomingdales, Lord &amp;amp; Taylor, Macy’s and others as defendants. Mr. Forge found it outrageous. The way he saw it, PilyQ was compensating Ms. Ferrarini for her creation — and was now being sued by someone who he believed had copied that work and passed it off as her own to the United States Copyright Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Forge contacted a lawyer who had done work for Victoria’s Secret in the Kiini matter, Michelle Rutherford, and asked her to take on a new client. On June 13, on behalf of Ms. Ferrarini, Ms. Rutherford sued Ms. Irgit and Kiini in federal court, in the Central District of California, citing unfair business practices and asking for a public apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On July 3, one of Ms. Irgit’s lawyers, citing “irreconcilable differences,” petitioned the court to be removed from his role as counsel in her case against Neiman Marcus and the others. On July 6, Ms. Irgit withdrew her case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;Ms. Ferrarini on the beach in Trancoso.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dado Galdieri for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mark A. Berman, Ms. Irgit’s lawyer in the case in which she is the defendant, has filed motions to dismiss and to have Ms. Rutherford disqualified. The judge, Fernando M. Olguin, who also oversaw Kiini’s action against Victoria’s Secret, has not yet ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It’s unclear what the implications of the new lawsuit are for Ms. Irgit. David J. Christopher, the chief of operations for the United States Copyright Office, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the allegations are notable to other experts in intellectual property law. “The role of truth in our judicial system is central,” said &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&amp;amp;itemID=8161&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jeanne M. Heffernan&lt;/a&gt;, a partner in the law firm Kirkland &amp;amp; Ellis. “Here you have a woman who appears to have taken the I.P. of someone else and registered it as her own — and then, it seems, had the audacity to sue an industry over something she did not create and may have stolen. If true, it’s breathtaking. I would think Victoria’s Secret would want to take a second look at their settlement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When I spoke to Ms. Irgit in her Tribeca apartment this summer, she said she was not concerned about the case and was trying to focus on her company. Sales are not what they were during what Ms. Wu said were the peak times of 2015 and 2016, but Ms. Irgit is developing new products, including swimsuits for girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As for the allegations in the lawsuit, Ms. Irgit said she sent photographs of Ms. Ferrarini’s bikini to Ms. Wu in 2012 because she liked the colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;She said the reason a photograph of a distinctive Trancoso pineapple cart had appeared on an early version of the Kiini website was simply because “it was a cute photo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;She didn’t have much to say about why the bathing suit shown in a photograph submitted to the Copyright Office is a near replica of Ms. Ferrarini’s bikini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;She said the note promising Ms. Wu a reward if a court verdict went her way was not a bribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At one point during the interview, Ms. Irgit walked into another room and returned with what she considered evidence that she created the design that became the Kiini. It was a bikini made in the Ferrarini/Kiini style, with elastic woven through crochet sewed to fabric — in this case, padded leotard-like pink fabric with mustard-yellow polka dots. The suit, she said, was made in 1999 and had been at her aunt’s house in Turkey until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Irgit declined to be quoted directly on a number of topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Last month, though, she sent me an email expressing anger at Ms. Wu. She was even angrier with PilyQ and Mr. Forge, whom she called a “bully” and a “scumbag.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“What do they tell their children at the dinner table about how they make money?” Ms. Irgit wrote, saying she imagined them as film characters like Dr. Evil, from “Austin Powers,” and Maleficent, from “Sleeping Beauty,” attaching .gifs of them to illustrate her point. (“Ipek’s cartoon perspective is fitting for someone who lives in a world where people who expose frauds are villains and people who commit them are victims,” Mr. Forge said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Irgit’s email also contained some positives. She pointed out that there would not be press attention and legal fights over crochet bikinis had she not envisioned and marketed a trendsetting global brand. “I must have done something right,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Back in Trancoso, I asked Ms. Ferrarini what she wished would happen to Ms. Irgit. She replied with a reference to the colors of Brazil, and maybe of the bikini she had crocheted into existence. “&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;Eu quero que ela se ferre em verde e amarelo&lt;/em&gt;,” she told me. “I want her to get screwed in green and yellow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in hot water with Congress following new revelations about his company's data-sharing practices, with some senators saying he may have misled Congress when he testified this year about protecting the privacy of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Zuckerberg told us that this kind of nonsense would end and it didn’t,&quot; Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said Wednesday. &quot;Now the first time, you can argue it’s a mistake, but the second time, it’s a choice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-continued&quot;&gt;Story Continued Below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Squaring his comments with the facts is very hard,&quot; said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his congressional testimony in April, Zuckerberg assured lawmakers that “we don't sell data to anyone.” But The New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday night that Facebook has long had financially beneficial agreements with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Netflix and Spotify that allowed them to gain access to people’s timelines, friend lists, private messages and other data — at times without the users’ knowledge or expressed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers didn't say whether the CEO should face consequences. Instead, Democrats and Republicans talked up the need for privacy legislation to regulate how Facebook and other companies collect, store and share consumer data — even though the two parties have yet to coalesce around a single legislative proposal or set of principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outgoing Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said the details of Facebook's data-sharing arrangements provide &quot;even more ammunition for doing a privacy bill early next year.&quot; Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), his replacement, told POLITICO to &quot;count on hearings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When companies repeatedly lie to Congress and the American people about what they do with our messages, location, likes and everything else, Congress has a duty to do something about it,&quot; Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the eye-popping details in the Times’ lengthy investigation: Facebook granted Netflix and Spotify the ability to read users' private messages, and maintained agreements to trade data with Huawei and Yandex, companies whose connections to the Chinese and Russian governments, respectively, have raised national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnerships included a data-sharing deal with Apple, whose CEO Tim Cook has criticized Facebook's privacy practices, though Apple said it was not aware it had special access, according to the Times. Facebook later identified the New York Times itself as one partner, saying it allowed users to see recommendations from Facebook friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new revelations were especially galling to lawmakers in light of Zuckerberg’s two days of congressional testimony this spring. He asserted that Facebook gives users control over how their data is used and whether to erase it, and pledged that the company would make privacy settings easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s beyond obvious at this point that social media platforms are simply not up to the task of voluntarily ensuring the privacy and security of their users,&quot; said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), himself a former telecom executive and investor. &quot;Congress must step in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) agreed. &quot;It has never been more clear. We need a federal privacy law,&quot; he said. “They are never going to volunteer to do the right thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times story also puts more pressure on the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees companies’ adherence to their privacy promises and is already investigating a different Facebook data scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTC has leverage through a 2011 consent decree in which Facebook promised to notify consumers and gain their consent before sharing information beyond their privacy settings. Now &quot;the credibility of those big promises and the agency’s capacity to function effectively as a privacy authority&quot; are at stake as Facebook's privacy woes pile up, said William Kovacic, who served as chairman of the FTC from 2008 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another agency veteran said the emerging details about how Facebook handles data and runs its business could also fuel antitrust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The latest revelations make the case for a breakup of Facebook stronger,&quot; Tim Wu, a former FTC senior adviser and now a Columbia Law School professor, told POLITICO. &quot;The case for antitrust action has often been triggered by evidence that agencies can’t control a company.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m shocked that Facebook committed these violations while under FTC consent decree, without any apparent sense that they have to follow the law, even while on parole,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook downplayed the nature of its data-sharing partnerships, saying they allowed users to access their Facebook profiles on devices and platforms from other companies, such as Apple and Amazon, and enabled people to engage with Facebook friends on outside services, such as Spotify and Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To be clear: none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people’s permission, nor did they violate our ... settlement with the FTC,&quot; Facebook's director of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebooks-partners/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also regarded these partners as extensions of itself because they committed to abide by its privacy guidelines, according to the Times report, and therefore the company felt it did not need users' permission before sharing their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the revelations are further inflaming Facebook's problems in Washington, which have been building for months following a series of data breaches as well as reports about how Russian operatives have used the social network to interfere in U.S. elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously Facebook is making this up as they’re going along,&quot; said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.). &quot;They’re not giving us all the information that we had been told that we were going to receive in terms of the compromise of the privacy of Americans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kyle Daly, Cristiano Lima and Nancy Scola contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
