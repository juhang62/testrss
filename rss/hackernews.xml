<title>Goodbye, Clean Code</title>
<link>https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It was a late evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague has just checked in the code that they’ve been writing all week. We were working on a graphics editor canvas, and they implemented the ability to resize shapes like rectangles and ovals by dragging small handles at their edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was repetitive. Each shape (such as a rectangle or an oval) had a different set of handles, and dragging each handle in different directions affected the shape’s position and size in a different way. If the user held Shift, we’d also need to preserve proportions while resizing. There was a bunch of math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot; readability=&quot;80&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Rectangle &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeTopLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeTopRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeBottomLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeBottomRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Oval &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeTop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeBottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Header &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; TextBlock &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeTopLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeTopRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeBottomLeft&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;resizeBottomRight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; size&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; preserveAspect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dx&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; dy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That repetitive math was really bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t &lt;em&gt;clean&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the repetition was between similar directions. For example, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Oval.resizeLeft()&lt;/code&gt; had similarities with &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Header.resizeLeft()&lt;/code&gt;. This was because they both dealt with dragging the handle on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other similarity was between the methods for the same shape. For example, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Oval.resizeLeft()&lt;/code&gt; had similarities with the other &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Oval&lt;/code&gt; methods. This was because they all dealt wih ovals. There was also some duplication between &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Header&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TextBlock&lt;/code&gt; because text blocks &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; rectangles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could &lt;em&gt;remove all duplication&lt;/em&gt; by grouping the code like this instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Directions &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; Shapes &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Oval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then composing their behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;jsx&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bottom&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; left&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; right&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Directions&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;directions&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; fourCorners &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; left&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;top&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; right&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; TextBox &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Shapes&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Rectangle&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; fourCorners&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is half the total size, and the duplication is gone completely! So &lt;em&gt;clean&lt;/em&gt;. If we want to change the behavior for a particular direction or a shape, we could do it in a single place instead of updating methods all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was already late at night (I got carried away). I checked in my refactoring to master and went to bed, proud of how I untangled my colleague’s messy code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-next-morning&quot;&gt;The Next Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… did not go as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss invited me for a one-on-one chat where they politely asked me to revert my change. I was aghast. The old code was a mess, and mine was &lt;em&gt;clean&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begrudginly complied, but it took me years to see they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-a-phase&quot;&gt;It’s a Phase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsessing with “clean code” and removing duplication is a phase many of us go through. When we don’t feel confident in our code, it is tempting to attach our sense of self-worth and professional pride to something that can be measured. A set of strict lint rules, a naming schema, a file structure, a lack of duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t automate removing duplication, but it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get easier with practice. You can usually tell whether there’s less or more of it after every change. As a result, removing duplication feels like improving some objective metric about the code. Worse, it messes with people’s sense of identity: &lt;em&gt;“I’m the kind of person who writes clean code”&lt;/em&gt;. It’s as powerful as any sort of self-deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we learn how to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;abstractions&lt;/a&gt;, it is tempting to get high on that ability, and pull abstractions out of thin air whenever we see repetitive code. After a few years of coding, we see repetition &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; — and abstracting is our new superpower. If someone tells us that abstraction is a &lt;em&gt;virtue&lt;/em&gt;, we’ll eat it. And we’ll start judging other people for not worshipping “cleanliness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see now that my “refactoring” was a disaster in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I didn’t talk to the person who wrote it. I rewrote the code and checked it in without their input. Even if it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an improvement (which I don’t believe anymore), this is a terrible way to go about it. A healthy engineering team is constantly &lt;em&gt;building trust&lt;/em&gt;. Rewriting your teammate’s code without a discussion is a huge blow to your ability to effectively collaborate on a codebase together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, nothing is free. My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication, and it was not a good trade. For example, we later needed many special cases and behaviors for different handles on different shapes. My abstraction would have to become several times more convoluted to afford that, whereas with the original “messy” version such changes stayed easy as cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I saying that you should write “dirty” code? No. I suggest to think deeply about what you mean when you say “clean” or “dirty”. Do you get a feeling of revolt? Righteousness? Beauty? Elegance? How sure are you that you can name the concrete engineering outcomes corresponding to those qualities? How exactly do they affect the way the code is written and &lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/&quot;&gt;modified&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sure didn’t think deeply about any of those things. I thought a lot about how the code &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; — but not about how it &lt;em&gt;evolved&lt;/em&gt; with a team of squishy humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding is a journey. Think how far you came from your first line of code to where you are now. I reckon it was a joy to see for the first time how extracting a function or refactoring a class can make convoluted code simple. If you find pride in your craft, it is tempting to pursue cleanliness in code. Do it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t stop there. Don’t be a clean code zealot. Clean code is not a goal. It’s an attempt to make some sense out of the immense complexity of systems we’re dealing with. It’s a defense mechanism when you’re not yet sure how a change would affect the codebase but you need guidance in a sea of unknows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let clean code guide you. &lt;strong&gt;Then let it go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reality has a surprising amount of detail (2017)</title>
<link>http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My dad emigrated from Colombia to North America when he was 18 looking looking for a better life. For my brother and I that meant a lot of standing outside in the cold. My dad’s preferred method of improving his lot was improving lots, and my brother and I were “voluntarily” recruited to help working on the buildings we owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how I came to spend a substantial part of my teenage years replacing fences, digging trenches, and building flooring and sheds. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned from all this building, it’s that reality has a surprising amount of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turns out to explain why its so easy for people to end up intellectually stuck. Even when they’re literally the best in the world in their field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider building some basement stairs for a moment. Stairs seem pretty simple at first, and at a high level they are simple, just two long, wide parallel boards (2” x 12” x 16’), some boards for the stairs and an angle bracket on each side to hold up each stair. But as you actually start building you’ll find there’s a surprising amount of nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice is that there are actually quite a few subtasks. Even at a high level, you have to cut both ends of the 2x12s at the correct angles; then screw in some u-brackets to the main floor to hold the stairs in place; then screw in the 2x12s into the u-brackets; then attach the angle brackets for the stairs; then screw in the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;Those goddamn stairs.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/stairs-diagram.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Those goddamn stairs.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next you’ll notice that each of those steps above decomposes into several steps, some of which have some tricky details to them due to the properties of the materials and task and the limitations of yourself and your tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem you’ll encounter is that cutting your 2x12s to the right angle is a bit complicated because there’s no obvious way to trace the correct angles. You can either get creative (there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a way to trace it), or you can bust out your trig book and figure out how to calculate the angle and position of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably also want to look up what are reasonable angles for stairs. What looks reasonable when you’re cutting and what feels safe can be different. Also, you’re probably going to want to attach a guide for your circular saw when cutting the angle on the 2x12s because the cut has to be pretty straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to you will quickly find that getting the stair boards at all the same angle is non-trivial. You’re going to need something that can give you an angle to the main board very consistently. Once you have that, and you’ve drawn your lines, you may be dismayed to discover that your straight looking board is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; straight. Lumber warps after it’s made because it was cut when it was new and wet and now it’s dryer, so no lumber is perfectly straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gone back to the lumber store and gotten some straighter 2x12s and redrawn your lines, you can start screwing in your brackets. Now you’ll learn that despite &lt;em&gt;starting&lt;/em&gt; aligned with the lines you drew, after screwing them in, your angle brackets are no longer quite straight because the screws didn’t go in quite straight and now they tightly secure the bracket at the wrong angle. You can fix that by drilling guide holes first. Also you’ll have to move them an inch or so because it’s more or less impossible to get a screw to go in differently than it did the first time in the same hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re finally ready to screw in the stair boards. If your screws are longer than 2”, you’ll need different ones, otherwise they will poke out the top of the board and stab you in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every step and every level there’s an abundance of detail with material consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to think ‘So what?’ and dismiss these details as incidental or specific to stair carpentry. And they &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; specific to stair carpentry; that’s what makes them details. But the existence of a surprising number of meaningful details is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; specific to stairs. Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this everywhere if you look. For example, you’ve probably had the experience of doing something for the first time, maybe growing vegetables or using a Haskell package for the first time, and being frustrated by how many annoying snags there were. Then you got more practice and then you told yourself ‘man, it was so simple all along, I don’t know why I had so much trouble’. We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a programmer, you might think that the fiddliness of programming is a special feature of programming, but really it’s that everything is fiddly, but you only notice the fiddliness when you’re new, and in programming you do new things more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think the fiddly detailiness of things is limited to human centric domains, and that physics itself is simple and elegant. That’s true in some sense – the physical laws themselves tend to be quite simple – but the manifestation of those laws is often complex and counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the boiling of water. That’s straightforward, water boils at 100 °C, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the stairs seemed simple too, so let’s double check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in the shoes of someone at the start of the 1800’s, with only a crude, unmarked mercury thermometer, trying to figure the physics of temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your stove, put some water in a pot, start heating some water, and pay attention as it heats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I suggest actually doing this)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll probably notice is a lot of small bubbles gathering on the surface of the pot. Is that boiling? The water’s not that hot yet; you can still even stick your finger in. Then the bubbles will appear faster and start rising, but they somehow seem ‘unboiling’. Then you’ll start to see little bubble storms in patches, and you start to hear a hissing noise. Is that Boiling? Sort of? It doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like boiling. The bubble storms grow larger and start releasing bigger bubbles. Eventually the bubbles get big and the surface of the water grows turbulent as the bubbles begin to make it to the surface. Finally we seem to have reached real boiling. I guess this is the boiling point? That seems kind of weird, what were the things that happened earlier if not boiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, if you’d used a glass pot instead of a metal one, the water would boil at a higher temperature. If you cleaned the glass vessel with sulfuric acid, to remove any residue, you’d find that you can heat water substantially more before it boils and when it does boil it boils in little explosions of boiling and the temperature fluctuates unstably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still, if you trap a drop of water between two other liquids and heat it, you can raise the temperature to at least 300 °C with nothing happening. That kind of makes a mockery of the statement ‘water boils at 100 °C’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that ‘boiling’ is a lot more complicated than you thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surprising amount of detail is is not limited to “human” or “complicated” domains, it is a near universal property of everything from space travel to sewing, to your internal experience of your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you might think ‘So what? I guess things are complicated but I can just notice the details as I run into them; no need to think specifically about this’. And if you are doing things that are relatively simple, things that humanity has been doing for a long time, this is often true. But if you’re trying to do difficult things, things which are not known to be possible, it is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more difficult your mission, the more details there will be that are critical to understand for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might hope that these surprising details are irrelevant to your mission, but not so. Some of them will end up being key. Wood’s tendency to warp means it’s more accurate to trace a cut than to calculate its length and angle. The possibility of superheating liquids means it’s important to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_bed&quot;&gt;packed bed&lt;/a&gt; when boiling liquids in industrial processes lest your process be highly inefficient and unpredictable. The massive difference in weight between a rocket &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of fuel and an empty one means that a reusable rocket can’t hover if it can’t throttle down to a very small fraction of its original thrust, which in turn means it must plan its trajectory very precisely to achieve 0 velocity at exactly the moment it reaches the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;Some important details for colonizing the universe.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/colonizing-the-universe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Some important details for colonizing the universe.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might also hope that the important details will be obvious when you run into them, but not so. Such details aren’t &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; visible, even when you’re directly running up against them. Things can just seem messy and noisy instead. ‘Spirit’ thermometers, made using brandy and other liquors, were in common use in the early days of thermometry. They were even considered as a potential standard fluid for thermometers. It wasn’t until the careful work of Swiss physicist Jean-André De Luc in the 18th century that physicists realized that alcohol thermometers are highly nonlinear and highly variable depending on concentration, which is in turn hard to measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably also had experiences where you were trying to do something and growing increasingly frustrated because it wasn’t working, and then finally, after some time you realize that your solution method can’t possibly work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to see that noticing the right details is hard, is that different people end up noticing &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; details. My brother and I once built a set of stairs for the garage with my dad, and we ran into the problem of determining where to cut the long boards so they lie at the correct angle. After struggling with the problem for a while (and I do mean struggling, a 16’ long board is heavy), we got to arguing. I remembered from trig that we could figure out angle so I wanted to go dig up my textbook and think about it. My dad said, ‘no, no, no, let’s just trace it’, insisting that we could figure out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept arguing because I thought I was right. I felt really annoyed with him and he was annoyed with me. In retrospect, I think I saw the fundamental difficulty in what we were doing and I don’t think he appreciated it (look at the stairs picture and see if you can figure it out), he just heard ‘let’s draw some diagrams and compute the angle’ and didn’t think that was the solution, and if he had appreciated the thing that I saw I think he would have been more open to drawing some diagrams. But at the same time, he also understood that diagrams and math don’t account for the shape of the wood, which I did not appreciate. If we had been able to get these points across, we could have come to consensus. Drawing a diagram was probably a good idea, but computing the angle was probably not. Instead we stayed annoyed at each other for the next 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you’ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically invisible. It’s hard to put your attention on them because you don’t even know what you’re looking for. But &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you see them they quickly become so integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become essentially transparent. Do you remember the insights that were crucial in learning to ride a bike or drive? How about the details and insights you have that led you to be good at the things you’re good at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means it’s really easy to get &lt;em&gt;stuck&lt;/em&gt;. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why if you ask an anti-climate change person (or a climate scientist) “what could convince you you were wrong?” you’ll likely get back an answer like “if it turned out all the data on my side was faked” or some other extremely strong requirement for evidence rather than “I would start doubting if I noticed numerous important mistakes in the details my side’s data and my colleagues didn’t want to talk about it”. The second case is much more likely than the first, but you’ll never see it if you’re not paying close attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to do impossible things, this effect should &lt;em&gt;chill you to your bones&lt;/em&gt;. It means you could be intellectually stuck right at this very moment, with the evidence right in front of your face and you just can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is not easy to fix, but it’s not impossible either. I’ve mostly fixed it for myself. The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems &lt;em&gt;so wrong&lt;/em&gt;, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn’t have accomplished much if Sarah hadn’t pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to make roguelike games in Rust</title>

<description>&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This tutorial is free and open source, and all code uses the MIT license - so you are free to do with it as you like. My hope is that you will enjoy the tutorial, and make great games!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you enjoy this and would like me to keep writing, please consider supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/blackfuture&quot;&gt;my Patreon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, the fine fellows over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/new/&quot;&gt;r/roguelikedev&lt;/a&gt; run a &lt;em&gt;Tutorial Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; series - encouraging new programmers to join the ranks of roguelike developers. Most languages end up being represented, and this year (2019) I decided that I'd use it as an excuse to learn Rust. I didn't really want to use &lt;code&gt;libtcod&lt;/code&gt;, the default engine - so I created my own, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thebracket/rltk_rs&quot;&gt;RLTK&lt;/a&gt;. My initial entry into the series isn't very good, but I learned a lot from it - you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thebracket/rustyroguelike&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you are curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series always points people towards an excellent series of tutorials, using Python and &lt;code&gt;libtcod&lt;/code&gt;. You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Section 1 of this tutorial mirrors the structure of this tutorial - and tries to take you from zero (&lt;em&gt;how do I open a console to say Hello Rust&lt;/em&gt;) to hero (&lt;em&gt;equipping items to fight foes in a multi-level dungeon&lt;/em&gt;). I'm hoping to continue to extend the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to use an Entity Component System. Rust has an excellent one called Specs, so I went with it. I've used ECS-based setups in previous games, so it felt natural to me to use it. It's also a cause of continual confusion on the subreddit, so hopefully this tutorial can shine some light on its benefits and why you might want to use one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a &lt;strong&gt;blast&lt;/strong&gt; writing this - and hope to continue writing. Please feel free to contact me (I'm &lt;code&gt;@herberticus&lt;/code&gt; on Twitter) if you have any questions, ideas for improvements, or things you'd like me to add. Also, sorry about all the Patreon spam - hopefully someone will find this sufficiently useful to feel like throwing a coffee or two my way. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0eed&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;In 1982, determined to find a job in the music industry, he called the Toronto office of the then-upstart label Virgin Records every day for months until it hired him in the marketing department. But after three years at Virgin, Mercuriadis was itching to work on the artist side of the business. He moved to London to join Sanctuary Music, a rapidly expanding management firm whose initial client was the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5c77&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;Mercuriadis became infatuated with maintaining Iron Maiden’s career after years of creative upheaval between its main songwriter and its lead singer. He endeared himself to them with his passion for the music, as well as his rapidly evolving marketing skills. For the launch of the band’s 1992 album, &lt;em class=&quot;ji&quot;&gt;Fear of the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, Mercuriadis flew dozens of journalists, radio disc jockeys, and label personnel to London. The guests were ferried by double-decker buses to a site where an elaborate indoor casino and carnival set had been built, complete with pinball machines, card dealers, and extravagant food. The band played only one song. “It was surreal. I had one journalist say to me, ‘I feel like I’ve won an MTV contest,’” recalls Ellyn Solis, who at the time was the band’s publicist at Epic Records. “It had to have been six figures.” Afterward, while the guests partied in the hotel bar, Mercuriadis printed out the next day’s itinerary and went to every room and slid the paper under the door. “He’s like the Pied Piper. Everyone follows him because he has such a creative passion for what he does,” Solis says. “He’s a true music and artist guy, and he’s always one step ahead of everyone else.”&lt;/p&gt;

Mercuriadis launched Hipgnosis Songs Fund in 2017, which raised nearly $1 billion to snap up the publishing rights of some of the biggest songwriters in music today.
&lt;p id=&quot;3cba&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;In 2000, Mercuriadis moved to New York to become the president of Sanctuary Music’s North American office. By this time, Sanctuary was a publicly traded company, and Mercuriadis was charged with developing a record label and publishing arm in addition to growing the management roster to eventually add Beyoncé, Elton John, and Axl Rose. Rose was still toiling on Guns N’ Roses’ sixth album, the long-delayed &lt;em class=&quot;ji&quot;&gt;Chinese Democracy&lt;/em&gt;. But as the album’s release date continued to be pushed back, Sanctuary started hemorrhaging money in 2004, coming up woefully short on meeting revenue expectations and laying off a good portion of the company’s staff. Sanctuary was eventually sold two years later to Universal Records for $41 million. A manager’s single greatest skill is protecting their artists. After Sanctuary’s dissolution, most of Mercuriadis’ management clients left him, a rare setback for a man so committed to his artists and their art. “I definitely felt like a failure,” he admits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0a8b&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;When Spotify launched in 2008, Mercuriadis became intrigued by streaming music. Central to Spotify’s user experience was the ability to create personalized playlists by culling songs from all genres and artists. The start-to-finish thread of a full album was becoming less important to streaming adopters. In decades past, he observed, the majority of artists wrote their own songs. Kurt Cobain wrote all the lyrics and much of the music for Nirvana’s 1991 album, &lt;em class=&quot;ji&quot;&gt;Nevermind&lt;/em&gt;. Contrast that with Adele, who worked with 10 different songwriters for her 2015 smash, &lt;em class=&quot;ji&quot;&gt;25&lt;/em&gt;. “It became clear to me that the power was shifting from the artist to the songwriter,” Mercuriadis says. “But the songwriters weren’t in a position to reap the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6d51&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;Today, the music industry is in the midst of an arms race to tap the next song and artist who rockets into the pop culture. Columbia Records has thrown millions at Lil Nas X for “Old Town Road” and Arizona Zervas for his song “Roxanne,” both of which first exploded in 2019 on the video-sharing social app TikTok. A forward-thinking manager can find new ways to grow his clients’ reach. Take Moe Shalizi, who landed his EDM client Marshmello 10 million users when he played a virtual concert inside the world of the wildly popular video game &lt;em class=&quot;ji&quot;&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;fb b kc kd ax&quot;&gt;In 2018, he launched Hipgnosis Songs Fund with a head-turning acquisition: $23.75 million for a 75% stake in The Dream’s catalog — the songwriter behind hits like Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3f61&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ke fv kf ij kg il kh in ki ip&quot;&gt;Despite the wellspring of fresh moneymaking opportunities for artists, Mercuriadis recognized that the structure of the music business has largely remained the same for the songwriter. Artists make most of their money by touring and selling merchandise, while the songwriter has access to none of that. But shouldn’t they? After all, it was the songwriter who gave the artist material to tour behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b743&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;“I liken the music industry to an oil tanker,” says Vickie Nauman, who serves as an adviser to firms looking for a piece of the publishing market. “And there’s all these speedboats zipping around the ship trying to get it to alter course with new technology or ideas. But as history has shown, that oil tanker takes a long time to turn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e828&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;With Hipgnosis Songs Fund, Mercuriadis bypassed all of them. Songwriters are able to generate revenue from three sources: mechanical royalties (the sale or legal download of a song), performance royalties (paid every time a song is heard in public, whether it’s a live performance, on TV, or in a movie; played in a bar or restaurant; or streamed), and synch fees (song licensing for use in movies, video games, and commercials). Mechanical royalties are the only stream with a set rate; performance and synch royalties are negotiated percentages. Synchs are often more lucrative for the songwriter, since they generally split 50% for the writer and the artist, with the label taking its cut from the artist’s piece of the pie. Synch is where Hipgnosis Song Fund could make them money, as Mercuriadis explained to the 177 hedge fund and private investors he pitched between 2015 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c2a0&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;Soon after launching, Mercuriadis made his first head-turning acquisition: $23.75 million for a 75% stake in The Dream’s catalog — the prolific songwriter behind hits like Rihanna’s “Umbrella” and Beyoncé’s “Put a Ring On It.” “He told me I could be the next Quincy Jones and laid out the plan. How can you not listen to him?” says The Dream (whose real name is Terius Youngdell Nash). “I’m recruiting people all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;js&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;46ae&quot; class=&quot;jt ju jv at fb b jw jx jy jz ka kb ip&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;fb b kc kd ax&quot;&gt;“He told me I could be the next Quincy Jones and laid out the plan. How can you not listen to him?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dd87&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ke fv kf ij kg il kh in ki ip&quot;&gt;Today, the business operates like a cross between an investment fund and a talent management agency. While Mercuriadis brokers the catalog deals, each of his 19 employees is responsible for monetization opportunities for a portfolio of songs. He plans to at least double the number of people working for him this year. “I want to get rid of the word ‘publishing,’” he says. (His preferred description: “song management.”) “Major publishers have small staffs working with hundreds of thousands of songs. We’re shooting for thousands of songs and having synch managers who are each responsible for a much smaller amount,” he says. “We’ll make a lot more money than anyone else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4a7c&quot; class=&quot;ie if fa at ig b ft ih fv ii ij ik il im in io ip&quot;&gt;Plenty of artists are happy with their current publishing deals. But don’t think for a moment that songwriters aren’t seeing the fat checks Hipgnosis is cutting and pushing their managers to get a meeting. In 2017, the attorney for Justin Beiber’s songwriter Poo Bear cold-called Mercuriadis. After a few meetings, Poo Bear backed out of a different publishing deal. “I didn’t know who he was, but for Merck, it’s music, music, music, all of the time,” says Poo Bear, who has since sold Hipgnosis every song he’s written up until July 2018. “As an artist, I want to work with people that are as passionate about my songs as I am.” As for his future works? “I wouldn’t do a deal like that with anyone else other than Merck.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A billion medical images are exposed online</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article__contributor-byline-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;26.263888888889&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contributor-byline__bio&quot; readability=&quot;5.9305555555556&quot;&gt;This story was reported in partnership with health news site &lt;a href=&quot;https://themighty.com/2020/01/unsecured-medical-image-data-threat-to-patients&quot;&gt;The Mighty.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;featured__span-first-words&quot;&gt;Every day, millions&lt;/span&gt; of new medical images containing the personal health information of patients are spilling out onto the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of hospitals, medical offices and imaging centers are running insecure storage systems, allowing anyone with an internet connection and free-to-download software to access over 1 billion medical images of patients across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of all the exposed images, which include X-rays, ultrasounds and CT scans, belong to patients in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite warnings from security researchers who have spent weeks alerting hospitals and doctors’ offices to the problem, many have ignored their warnings and continue to expose their patients’ private health information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems to get worse every day,” said Dirk Schrader, who led the research at Germany-based security firm Greenbone Networks, which has been monitoring the number of exposed servers for the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is well-documented. Greenbone found 24 million patient exams storing more than 720 million medical images in September, which first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbone.net/en/unprotected-patient-data-on-the-internet-a-massive-global-data-leak/&quot;&gt;unearthed the scale&lt;/a&gt; of the problem &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/millions-of-americans-medical-images-and-data-are-available-on-the-internet&quot;&gt;as reported by ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;. Two months later, the number of exposed servers had increased by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenbone.net/en/the-good_bad_ugly-amount_is_rising/&quot;&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt;, to 35 million patient exams, exposing 1.19 billion scans and representing a considerable violation of patient privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem shows little sign of abating. “The amount of data exposed is still rising, even considering the amount of data taken offline due to our disclosures,” said Schrader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If doctors fail to take action, he said the number of exposed medical images will hit a new high “in no time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1931710&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1931710&quot; class=&quot;breakout wp-image-1931710 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;644&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png 2576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png?resize=1536,966 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png?resize=2048,1288 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/patient-scan.png?resize=50,31 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1931710&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Over a billion medical images remain exposed. Experts say the number is getting worse, not better. (Image: supplied)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the problem is caused by a common weakness found on the servers used by hospitals, doctors’ offices and radiology centers to store patient medical images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decades-old file format and industry standard known as DICOM was designed to make it easier for medical practitioners to store medical images in a single file and share them with other medical practices. DICOM images can be viewed using any of the free-to-use apps, as would any radiologist. DICOM images are typically stored in a picture archiving and communications system, known as a PACS server, allowing for easy storage and sharing. But many doctors’ offices disregard security best practices and connect their PACS server directly to the internet without a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These unprotected servers not only expose medical imaging but also patient personal health information. Many patient scans include cover sheets baked into the DICOM file, including the patient’s name, date of birth and sensitive information about their diagnoses. In some cases, hospitals use a patient’s Social Security number to identify patients in these systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas Lundgren, a Sweden-based security researcher, spent part of last year looking at the extent of exposed medical image data. In November, he demonstrated to TechCrunch how easy it was for anyone to view medical data from exposed servers. In just a few minutes, he found one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles exposing tens of thousands of patients’ scans dating back several years. The server was later secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the largest hospitals and imaging centers in the United States are the biggest culprits of exposing medical data. Schrader said the exposed data puts patients at risk of becoming “perfect victims for medical insurance fraud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, patients are unaware that their data could be exposed on the internet for anyone to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mighty, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://themighty.com/2020/01/unsecured-medical-image-data-threat-to-patients&quot;&gt;examined the effect on patients&lt;/a&gt;, found exposed medical information puts patients at a greater risk of insurance fraud and identity theft. Exposed data can also erode the relationship between patients and their doctors, leading to patients becoming less willing to share potentially pertinent information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our investigation, we found a number of U.S. imaging centers storing decades of patient scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One patient, whose information was exposed following a visit to an emergency room in Florida last year, described her exposed medical data as “scary” and “uncomfortable.” Another with a chronic illness had regular scans at a hospital in California over a period of 30 years. And one unprotected server at one of the largest military hospitals in the United States exposed the names of military personnel and medical images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even in cases of patients with only one or a handful of medical images, the exposed data can be used to infer a picture of a person’s health, including illnesses and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1931709&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1931709&quot; class=&quot;breakout wp-image-1931709 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;643&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png 2909w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png?resize=1536,965 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png?resize=2048,1287 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/exposed-health-data.png?resize=50,31 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1931709&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Many patient scans include cover sheets containing personal health information baked into the file. (Image: supplied)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to get the servers secured, Greenbone contacted more than a hundred organizations last month about their exposed servers. Many of the smaller organizations subsequently secured their systems, resulting in a small drop in the overall number of exposed images. But when the security company contacted the 10 largest organizations, which accounted for about one-in-five of all exposed medical images, Schrader said there was “no response at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenbone privately shared names of the organizations to allow TechCrunch to follow up with each medical office, including a health provider with three hospitals in New York, a radiology company in Florida with a dozen locations and a major California-based hospital. (We’re not naming the affected organizations to limit the risk of exposing patient data.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one organization secured its servers. Northeast Radiology, a partner of Alliance Radiology, had the largest cache of exposed medical data in the U.S., according to Greenbone’s data, with more than 61 million images on about 1.2 million patients across its five offices. The server was secured only after TechCrunch followed up a month after Greenbone first warned the organization of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alliance spokesperson Tracy Weise declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schrader said if the remaining affected organizations took their exposed systems off the internet, almost 600 million images would “disappear” from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts who have warned about exposed servers for years say medical practices have few excuses. Yisroel Mirsky, a security researcher who has studied security vulnerabilities in medical equipment, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dicomstandard.org/using/security/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; that security features set out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dicomstandard.org/using/security/&quot;&gt;the standards body&lt;/a&gt; that created and maintains the DICOM standard have “largely been ignored” by the device manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schrader did not lay blame on the device manufacturers. Instead, he said it was “pure negligence” that doctor’s offices failed to properly configure and secure their servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucia Savage, a former senior privacy official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said more has to be done to improve security across the healthcare industry — especially at the level of smaller organizations that lack resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the data is personal health information, it is required to be secured from unauthorized access, which includes finding it on the internet,” said Savage. “There is an equal obligation to lock the file room that contains your paper medical records as there is to secure digital health information,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical records and personal health data are highly protected under U.S. law. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) created the “security rule,” which included technical and physical safeguards designed to protect electronic personal health information by ensuring the data is kept private and secure. The law also holds healthcare providers accountable for any security lapses. Running afoul of the law can lead to severe penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-block block--pullout block--right&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As Health and Human Services aggressively pushes to permit a wider range of parties to have access to the sensitive health information of American patients without traditional privacy protections attaching to that information, HHS’s inattention to this particular incident becomes even more troubling.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/05/06/tennessee-diagnostic-medical-imaging-services-company-pays-3000000-settle-breach.html&quot;&gt;fined one Tennessee-based medical imaging company $3 million&lt;/a&gt; for inadvertently exposing a server containing over 300,000 protected patient data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deven McGraw, who was the top privacy official in the Health and Human Services’ enforcement arm — the Office of Civil Rights, said if security assistance was more available to smaller providers, the government could focus its enforcement efforts on providers that willfully ignore their security obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Government enforcement is important, as is guidance and support for lower resourced providers and easy-to-deploy solutions that are built into the technology,” said McGraw. “It may be too big of a problem for any single law enforcement agency to truly put a dent in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the scale of exposed medical servers was first revealed in September, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) called for answers from Health and Human Services. Warner acknowledged that the number of U.S.-based exposed servers had decreased — 16 servers storing 31 million images — but told TechCrunch that “more needs to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To my knowledge, Health and Human Services has done nothing about it,” Warner told TechCrunch. “As Health and Human Services aggressively pushes to permit a wider range of parties to have access to the sensitive health information of American patients without traditional privacy protections attached to that information, HHS’s inattention to this particular incident becomes even more troubling,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights said it does not comment on individual cases but defended its enforcement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OCR has taken enforcement action in the past to address violations concerning unprotected storage servers, and continues robust enforcement of the HIPAA rules,” said the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will continue doing our best to improve the global situation of unprotected systems,” said Schrader. But he said there was not much more he can do beyond warn organizations of their exposed servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then it’s a question for the regulators,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Medications that change who we are</title>
<link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200108-the-medications-that-change-who-we-are</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200108-the-medications-that-change-who-we-are</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The matter takes on a whole new urgency, when you consider that some personality changes can be dramatic. There’s solid evidence that the drug L-dopa, which is used to treat Parkinson’s disease, increases the risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://n.neurology.org/content/67/7/1258.short&quot;&gt;Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs)&lt;/a&gt; – a group of problems that make it more difficult to resist temptations and urges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the drug can have life-ruining consequences, as some patients suddenly start taking more risks, becoming pathological gamblers, excessive shoppers, and sex pests. In 2009, a drug with similar properties hit the headlines, after a man with Parkinson’s committed a £45,000 ($60,000) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/6446763/Parkinsons-drug-made-former-councillor-carry-out-45000-eBay-ticket-fraud.html&quot;&gt;ticket scam&lt;/a&gt;. He blamed it on his medication, claiming that it had completely changed his personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association with impulsive behaviours makes sense, because L-dopa is essentially providing the brain with a dose of extra dopamine – in Parkinson’s disease the part of the brain that produces it is progressively destroyed – and the hormone is involved in providing us with feelings of pleasure and reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that L-dopa is the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15936832&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;effective treatment&lt;/a&gt; for many of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, and it’s prescribed to thousands of people in the US every year. This is despite a long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3394-41/carbidopa-levodopa-oral/carbidopa-levodopa-oral/details&quot;&gt;list of possible side effects&lt;/a&gt; that accompanies the medication, which explicitly mentions the risk of unusually strong urges, such as for gambling or sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, DeRubeis, Golomb and Mischkowski are all of the opinion that the drugs they’re studying will continue to be used, regardless of their potential psychological side-effects. &quot;We are human beings, you know,&quot; says Mischkowski. &quot;We take a lot of stuff that is not necessarily always good in every circumstance. I always use the example of alcohol, because it's also a painkiller, like paracetamol. We take it because we feel that it has a benefit for us, and it's OK as long as you take it in the right circumstances and you don't consume too much.&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order to minimise any undesirable effects and get the most out of the staggering quantities of medications that we all take each day, Mischkowski reiterates that we need to know more. Because at the moment, he says, how they are affecting the behaviour of individuals – and even entire societies – is largely a mystery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Haters</title>
<link>http://paulgraham.com/fh.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://paulgraham.com/fh.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/aah/paulgraham/haters-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;58&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Haters&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;January 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I originally intended this for startup founders, who are often surprised by the attention they get as their companies grow, but it applies equally to anyone else who becomes famous.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you become sufficiently famous, you'll acquire some fans who like you too much. These people are sometimes called &quot;fanboys,&quot; and although I dislike that term, I'm going to have to use it here. We need some word for them, because this is a distinct phenomenon from someone simply liking your work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fanboy is obsessive and uncritical. Liking you becomes part of their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head that is much better than reality. Everything you do is good, because you do it. If you do something bad, they find a way to see it as good. And their love for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one. They want everyone to know how great you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, you may be thinking, I could do without this kind of obsessive fan, but I know there are all kinds of people in the world, and if this is the worst consequence of fame, that's not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that is not the worst consequence of fame. As well as fanboys, you'll have haters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hater is obsessive and uncritical. Disliking you becomes part of their identity, and they create an image of you in their own head that is much worse than reality. Everything you do is bad, because you do it. If you do something good, they find a way to see it as bad. And their dislike for you is not, usually, a quiet, private one. They want everyone to know how awful you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking of checking, I'll save you the trouble. The second and fifth paragraphs are identical except for &quot;good&quot; being switched to &quot;bad&quot; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent years puzzling about haters. What are they, and where do they come from? Then one day it dawned on me. Haters are just fanboys with the sign switched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that by haters, I don't simply mean trolls. I'm not talking about people who say bad things about you and then move on. I'm talking about the much smaller group of people for whom this becomes a kind of obsession and who do it repeatedly over a long period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like fans, haters seem to be an automatic consequence of fame. Anyone sufficiently famous will have them. And like fans, haters are energized by the fame of whoever they hate. They hear a song by some pop singer. They don't like it much. If the singer were an obscure one, they'd just forget about it. But instead they keep hearing her name, and this seems to drive some people crazy. Everyone's always going on about this singer, but she's no good! She's a fraud!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That word &quot;fraud&quot; is an important one. It's the spectral signature of a hater to regard the object of their hatred as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=Musk%20fraud&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fraud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They can't deny their fame. Indeed, their fame is if anything exaggerated in the hater's mind. They notice every mention of the singer's name, because every mention makes them angrier. In their own minds they exaggerate both the singer's fame and her lack of talent, and the only way to reconcile those two ideas is to conclude that she has tricked everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not sure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally losers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally talented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone successful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely to regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because anyone famous knows how random fame is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But haters are not always complete losers. They are not always the proverbial guy living in his mom's basement. Many are, but some have some amount of talent. In fact I suspect that a sense of frustrated talent is what drives some people to become haters. They're not just saying &quot;It's unfair that so-and-so is famous,&quot; but &quot;It's unfair that so-and-so is famous, and not me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could a hater be cured if they achieved something impressive? My guess is that it's a moot point, because they never will. I've been able to observe for long enough that I'm fairly confident the pattern works both ways: not only do people who do great work never become haters, haters never do great work. Although I dislike the word &quot;fanboy,&quot; it's evocative of something important about both haters and fanboys. The fanboy is so slavishly predictable in his admiration that he's diminished as a result. He's less than a man. And I think this is true of haters too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, haters seem even more diminished. I can imagine being a fanboy. I can think of people whose work I admire so much that I could abase myself before them out of sheer gratitude. If P. G. Wodehouse were still alive, I could see myself being a Wodehouse fanboy. But I could not imagine being a hater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that haters are just fanboys with the sign bit flipped makes it much easier to deal with them. We don't need a separate theory of haters. We can just use existing techniques for dealing with obsessive fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important of which is simply not to think much about them. If you're like most people who become famous enough to acquire haters, your initial reaction will be one of mystification. Why does this guy seem to have it in for me? Where does his obsessive energy come from, and what makes him so appallingly nasty? What did I do to set him off? Is it something I can fix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mistake here is to think of the hater as someone you have a dispute with. When you have a dispute with someone, it's usually a good idea to try to understand why they're upset and then fix things if you can. Disputes are distracting. But it's a false analogy to think of a hater as someone you have a dispute with. It's an understandable mistake, if you've never encountered haters before. But when you realize that you're dealing with a hater, and what a hater is, it's clear that it's a waste of time even to think about them. If you have obsessive fans, do you spend any time wondering what makes them love you so excessively? No, you just think &quot;some people are kind of crazy,&quot; and that's the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since haters are equivalent to fanboys, that's the way to deal with them too. There may have been something that set them off. But it's not something that would have set off a normal person, so there's no reason to spend any time thinking about it. It's not you, it's them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] There are of course some people who are genuine frauds. How can you distinguish between x calling y a fraud because x is a hater, and because y is a fraud? Look at neutral opinion. Actual frauds are usually pretty conspicuous. Thoughtful people are rarely taken in by them. So if there are some thoughtful people who like y, you can usually assume y is not a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] I would make an exception for teenagers, who sometimes act in such extreme ways that they are literally not themselves. I can imagine a teenage kid being a hater and then growing out of it. But not anyone over 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3] I have a much worse memory for misdeeds than my wife Jessica, who is a connoisseur of character, but I don't wish it were better. Most disputes are a waste of time even if you're in the right, and it's easy to bury the hatchet with someone if you can't remember why you were mad at them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[4] A competent hater will not merely attack you individually but will try to get mobs after you. In some cases you may want to refute whatever bogus claim they made in order to do so. But err on the side of not, because ultimately it probably won't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Christine Ford, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Peter Thiel for reading drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, January 10, 2020, the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation released the fact-finding &lt;a href=&quot;http://factfindingjan2020.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; it commissioned to help the Institute understand the origins, nature, and extent of Jeffrey Epstein’s ties to MIT and learn from them.  The questions and answers below provide context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What prompted Goodwin Procter’s review?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In September, in response to revelations about engagements between MIT and Jeffrey Epstein, President Reif and the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation asked MIT’s general counsel to retain a law firm to design and conduct a review of the facts surrounding those engagements. The general counsel retained the firm Goodwin Procter to lead the process and report to the Executive Committee and to President Reif. The review focused on what donations Epstein made to MIT; who in MIT’s senior leadership was aware of or approved the donations; when and why Epstein visited MIT; and whether MIT’s leadership was aware of or approved those visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What did MIT release today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation released Goodwin Procter’s full fact-finding report regarding MIT’s interactions with Jeffrey Epstein, as well as a statement. President Reif released a response. And &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt; published an article summarizing the materials, all of which are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://factfindingjan2020.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation, and why did Goodwin Procter report to it and to President Reif?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The Executive Committee is the MIT Corporation’s principal governance committee. It has responsibility for overseeing the performance of the president, just as the president is responsible for overseeing the performance of his direct reports. Because the fact-finding was likely to uncover facts both about President Reif and his direct reports, Goodwin Procter reported both to the Executive Committee and to him. President Reif and Executive Vice President Israel Ruiz, who are &lt;em&gt;ex officio&lt;/em&gt; members of the Executive Committee, recused themselves from the Executive Committee’s oversight of the fact-finding. In October, when the fact-finders discovered that Chair of the Corporation Robert Millard had spoken with former Media Lab Director Joi Ito about Epstein, Chairman Millard recused himself as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did this process take so long? The MIT community expected that this report would be issued last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The Executive Committee wanted the fact-finding to be as thorough as possible. As new facts emerged, additional time was needed to investigate them fully. The report is the product of considerable work involving 73 interviews of 59 people and more than 610,000 documents and emails. Many of the interviews were with former employees whose schedules Goodwin Procter needed to accommodate. Since the Executive Committee decided to release the report in its entirety and with names, additional time was needed to address issues related to the privacy of those named. The Committee also did not want to release the report during final exam period or over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; The report refers to certain people by name and other people only by title or function. How was it determined who to name and whose privacy to respect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The report names current and former professors who solicited funds from Epstein, people from outside MIT who played a role in soliciting such funds, current and former members of the senior administration, and every professor known to have met with Epstein on campus. The names of junior staffers and others whose actions were not central to the events are not named, so as to protect the privacy of those who may have engaged briefly with Epstein in the course of doing their jobs. In his letter to the community, President Reif called for decency, fairness, and understanding in return for the report’s transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; On August 22, President Reif committed to contribute “an amount equal to the funds MIT received from any Epstein foundation to an appropriate charity that benefits his victims or other victims of sexual abuse.” At that time President Reif estimated that the donations were approximately $800,000. In the report we now see that the donations totaled $850,000.  Has MIT made this donation yet? If not, why not? And who is choosing the organizations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In the fall, President Reif asked MIT’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/committee/committee-sexual-misconduct-prevention-and-response&quot;&gt;Committee on Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response&lt;/a&gt; (CSMPR) to assess the landscape of charities that benefit survivors of sexual abuse and advise him on a suitable recipient for the donation. CSMPR is a faculty-led standing Institute committee of faculty, students, and staff, many of whom work closely with survivors of sexual abuse.  The Committee is diligently working to formulate a recommendation, which President Reif expects to receive shortly.  MIT will donate the full $850,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What steps is MIT taking to ensure that its fundraising processes and practices are consistent with Institute values?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In October, Chair of the Faculty Rick Danheiser and Provost Martin Schmidt &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2019/two-committees-examine-mit-outside-engagements-1015&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the creation of two related committees that will examine MIT’s external engagements and review its policies and processes for soliciting and accepting gifts. The committees are charged with recommending new guidelines for the Institute’s relationships with funding sources, and will deliver their recommendations in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is President Reif’s response to the report?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; President Reif’s response is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2020/letter-president-reif-fact-finding-report-0110&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Media reports suggested that Epstein was coded as “disqualified” in MIT’s donor system. Was he? And what does “disqualified” mean in this context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Contrary to media reports, Goodwin Procter’s review found that neither Epstein nor his foundations were ever coded as “disqualified” in MIT’s donor database. Further, the report notes that designation as “disqualified” does not mean that a person or entity is prohibited from donating to the Institute; rather, the term refers to any donor who is inactive or no longer interested in giving to MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Goodwin Procter’s report references a second law firm. Why was another firm involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; When Epstein’s donations to MIT were revealed, MIT’s general counsel retained Goodwin Procter, a law firm that has worked with the Institute in the past and that has extensive experience conducting internal investigations at academic institutions. That background allowed the firm to get up to speed quickly as it began its review. Soon thereafter, the Executive Committee engaged the law firm Paul Weiss, which also has extensive experience leading internal investigations and advising boards of directors but no prior relationship with MIT.  From a governance perspective, the Executive Committee felt Paul Weiss’s independence from the Institute was valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Alphabet’s Chief Legal Officer Stepping Down Amid Investigation</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — David Drummond, the chief legal officer of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and one of its most senior executives, is leaving the internet giant amid an investigation into his relationships with women who worked at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an email sent to employees at Google and Alphabet, Mr. Drummond, who joined Google in 2002, said he planned to leave Alphabet at the end of the month. He said that it was the “right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders” in light of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/google-larry-page-sergey-br.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders&lt;/a&gt;, stepping back from day-to-day roles at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His resignation comes more than a year after 20,000 Google employees protested &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the company’s handling of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; and inappropriate workplace relationships. The protests were a public reckoning for a permissive work culture that had existed since the company’s early days — exemplified by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;generous exit packages for senior executives&lt;/a&gt; even after they were accused of sexual misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In recent months, Mr. Drummond had come to symbolize how — despite the company’s assertions that it would no longer tolerate such actions — some powerful men in the technology world accused of inappropriate behavior often weathered the storm, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/tech-men-accused-sexual-misconduct-new-jobs-metoo&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;landing new jobs&lt;/a&gt; or keeping their old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some employees inside Google were dismayed that Mr. Drummond was not forced to leave after the details of an extramarital relationship he had with a woman who worked for him became public. The concerns about Mr. Drummond’s workplace romances took on new life when he recently married another woman from Google’s legal department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The departure of Mr. Drummond, who could not be reached for comment on Friday, signals a changing of the guard for Alphabet. He was one of the longest-serving and influential executives at the company. As an outside lawyer for the Silicon Valley firm Wilson Sonsini, he helped draft the original incorporation papers for Google and later became the company’s first general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was instrumental in many of the company’s prominent and sometimes controversial moves, including the decision to pull out of the Chinese market in 2010 and the legal battle with media companies over copyright claims on YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last month, in announcing that Mr. Page and Mr. Brin planned to step down from executive roles at the company, Alphabet announced that Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, would also lead the parent company. When Google in 2015 created the holding company called Alphabet and became one of its subsidiaries, Mr. Drummond was one of the few executives who was tapped to work for the parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Drummond also oversaw two of Alphabet’s investment arms, GV and CapitalG. At one point, he also served as a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/technology/uber-and-alphabets-rivalry-heats-up-as-director-chooses-sides.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;board member at Uber&lt;/a&gt; after an investment from GV, then called Google Ventures. He stepped down from the Uber board after it became apparent that Uber’s plans for a self-driving car would come into conflict with Google’s own driverless car ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the departure of Eric Schmidt, Google’s former chief executive, from Alphabet’s board last year, Mr. Drummond was seen as one of the last major links to its past culture problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jenn Kaiser, an Alphabet spokeswoman, said Mr. Drummond did not receive an exit package. However, his departure had been telegraphed in the last few months as he sold off most of his shares in Alphabet, unloading about $222 million worth of company stock since November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Based on public securities filings, Google has disclosed that it has paid Mr. Drummond at least $258 million, including stock options and grants, since 2006, according to Equilar, an executive compensation consulting firm. That does not include what Mr. Drummond was paid before the company’s lucrative initial public offering in 2004 and excludes some years when his compensation was not public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last year, a committee of independent directors from Alphabet’s board hired a law firm to investigate its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate relationships by current and former executives as part of its legal defense against shareholder lawsuits over its handling of the matters, according to documents viewed by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The shareholder lawsuits accused the board of enabling the misconduct of Alphabet executives. Among the subjects in the inquiry were Mr. Drummond’s relationships with women at the company, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Drummond faced additional scrutiny in August when Jennifer Blakely, a former senior contracts manager in Google’s legal department, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jennifer.blakely/my-time-at-google-and-after-b0af688ec3ab&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published an essay on Medium&lt;/a&gt; about her relationship with him. She wrote that Google forced her out of the legal department after the birth of their son made it impossible to the hide the relationship. Ms. Blakely was part of the Times article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Her essay also said that Mr. Drummond had other extramarital relationships with women at the company after they split. At the time, Mr. Drummond said he had never started a relationship with “anyone else who was working at Google or Alphabet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In his farewell note, Mr. Drummond did not mention any of the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I know this company is in the best of hands, and I am excited for what the future holds for Google, for Alphabet and for me,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
