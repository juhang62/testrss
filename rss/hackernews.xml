<title>UCLA asked faculty to consider declining to review for Elsevier journals</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;article__image img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com//img/photos/biz/photo_90219_landscape_850x566.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U. of California at Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the U. of California at Los Angeles, administrators have encouraged professors to effectively boycott the publishing giant as the university system negotiates a new contract for access to the company’s journals.&lt;/p&gt;
The University of California at Los Angeles has turned to an unusual bit of leverage as its system negotiates with Elsevier, the academic-publishing giant: its own faculty’s research.
&lt;p&gt;In a letter on Tuesday, campus officials asked faculty members to consider declining to review articles for Elsevier journals until contract negotiations “are clearly moving in a productive direction.” The letter also asked professors to consider publishing research elsewhere, including in prestigious open-access journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university system has said it wants to reach an agreement that would be less expensive and would simplify open-access publishing. But time for negotiations is running out: The contract expires on December 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only thing that the publishers have is the content authors give to them,” said Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason, university librarian at the University of California at Berkeley and a professor of economics and information, who is helping to lead the negotiations. “What they’re selling is access to research. If they don’t have the research, they have nothing to sell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UC system’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Journals/BigDeals/UCalifornia/ElsevierSD2014-2018.pdf&quot;&gt;five-year contract with Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; costs the system about $50 million. The contract allows students, faculty and staff members, and researchers to view the enormous trove of articles that Elsevier publishes. In 2017, the most recent year for which information is available, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/relx2017-annual-report.pdf&quot;&gt;Elsevier published more than 430,000 articles&lt;/a&gt; in some 2,500 journals, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-item__side-bar media-width-half media-pull-right&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-item__side-bar--body&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Chronicle Productivity&lt;br/&gt;Guide to Writing &amp;amp; Publishing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to its critics, the company has long epitomized the faults of a profitable industry that relies on unpaid labor in peer review and editorial management while charging ever-rising fees. (The company argues that the value of a subscription rises annually because the volume of content is increasing, and published articles are cited more frequently externally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter — from UCLA’s provost, Scott L. Waugh, as well as the chair of the Academic Senate and the university librarian — calls the current situation “unsustainable for the UC system.” A UCLA spokesman said Waugh was unavailable for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unusual letter may prove fraught among some of its recipients. While the library and the provost’s office deal with the direct costs of working with Elsevier, faculty members “are likely to have a much more nuanced relationship” with the company, said Rick Anderson, associate dean for collections and scholarly communication at the University of Utah’s Marriott Library. (Anderson recently joined a library advisory board set up by Elsevier; while he does not receive a stipend, his travel to board meetings has been paid for by the company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are absolutely, centrally important journals in their discipline — not because they’re published by Elsevier but because those journals have a long history of publishing some of the best science,” he said. “That matters to faculty members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-item__story__inline-ad center-block text-center ad-collapsible-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time to his knowledge, he said, that a campus administration has encouraged faculty members to boycott a specific publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason disputed that characterization, calling this a faculty-led effort and adding that there has been at least one other boycott of Elsevier initiated by UC faculty members. Fifteen years ago, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com/article/Scientists-at-U-of-California/111349&quot;&gt;sought a worldwide boycott&lt;/a&gt; of six Elsevier-published journals over the cost of access, according to news coverage at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Toward Open Access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the university system nor the company would comment on the specifics of negotiations. Broadly, UC wants one contract that would cover subscription charges and open-access publishing fees, MacKie-Mason said. He said universal, immediate open-access publication for all UC research is also a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UC also hopes to bring down the price of scholarly communications in cases where company profits far exceed the cost of publishing. “We can’t afford it, and we shouldn’t have to,” MacKie-Mason said. “This is publicly funded research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a quarter of what UC spends on journals goes to Elsevier, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.library.ucsf.edu/news/possible-impact-of-the-uc-journal-negotiations-with-elsevier/&quot;&gt;according to a letter&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California at San Francisco library and the Academic Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsevier said in a letter to University of California at Davis faculty editors that UC “wants to pay towards its authors publishing OA [open access] for the world to read freely but only pay a nominal amount to access the world’s subscribed content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is hard to reconcile, the letter said, in a publishing landscape that mixes subscription and open-access publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemma Hersh, Elsevier’s vice president for global policy, said the company wants to resolve the negotiations, adding that no fixed contract works for all universities, particularly regarding open-access standards. “What we’re observing,” she said, “is that globally our customers have different preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Front and Center’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-item__story__inline-ad center-block text-center ad-collapsible-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fully adopted boycott would probably have consequences, Utah’s Anderson said, although he expected that they would be minor. Perhaps more significant, he said, would be if other universities in the California system made similar suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason said there is a “reasonable chance” that the boycott could expand to elsewhere in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction to the university’s letter on social media by faculty members inside and outside the UC system skewed positive, with professors praising UCLA for using its clout to promote open access and to disrupt publishing as an industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, however, expressed concern about the impact on junior faculty members, who must publish to advance their careers. Elsevier’s journals signal prestige in the academic job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimi Adams, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Colorado at Denver, wrote in an email that many existing journals have an established brand, community, and track record — all helpful markers for junior scholars in the tenure process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s especially true for top specialty journals where people outside your area might have to rely more on those signals when they don’t have the expertise to evaluate others’ work outside their own area,” he wrote. “While I’m very in support of developing new avenues of open-access publishing, they aren’t a panacea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason said he did not expect junior faculty members to fear retaliation if they chose not to boycott. “Faculty are given great latitude to pursue their research and the communication of it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the UCLA campus, faculty members are sympathetic to the university’s effort to reduce expenses, particularly in a moment of scrutiny over college costs, said Edward Walker, a professor, vice chair, and director of graduate studies in the department of sociology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university’s letter, he said, had put the issue “front and center” for professors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason, the UC negotiator, said he hoped that if negotiations continued in good faith past the December 31 deadline, the university’s access to Elsevier’s journals would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Johnson &amp; Johnson knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-special-report-idUSKBN1OD1RQ</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-special-report-idUSKBN1OD1RQ</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20181214&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1335349656&amp;amp;r=LYNXMPEEBD13P&amp;amp;w=20&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darlene Coker is shown on a kitchen table full of many personal pictures of her family life in California, U.S. August 15, 2018. Picture taken August 15, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? “She wanted answers,” her daughter Cady Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson’s Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, alleging that “poisonous talc” in the company’s beloved product was her killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&amp;amp;J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. “When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,” he said. “We didn’t have it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&amp;amp;J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company’s talc caused their cancers — including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators’ plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&amp;amp;J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“RATHER HIGH”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest mentions of tainted J&amp;amp;J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&amp;amp;J’s Italian supplier as fibrous and “acicular,” or needle-like, tremolite. That’s one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&amp;amp;J, outside labs and J&amp;amp;J’s supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as “fiberform” and “rods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&amp;amp;J assured the regulator that no asbestos was “detected in any sample” of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn’t tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc – in one case at levels reported as “rather high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most internal J&amp;amp;J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&amp;amp;J’s testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected – and only a tiny fraction of the company’s talc is tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn’t been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence of what J&amp;amp;J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&amp;amp;J’s testing documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What J&amp;amp;J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs’ lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn’t necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two cases earlier this year – in New Jersey and California – juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&amp;amp;J talc products for their mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&amp;amp;J’s potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&amp;amp;J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“JUNK” SCIENCE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, “junk” science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Plaintiffs’ attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,” Ernie Knewitz, J&amp;amp;J’s vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters’ findings. “This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&amp;amp;J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters’ findings as “false and misleading.” “The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,” Bicks wrote. “This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos.” He dismissed tests cited in this article as “outlier” results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court, J&amp;amp;J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&amp;amp;J has also argued that some tests picked up “background” asbestos – stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades – in bottles from plaintiffs’ cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&amp;amp;J’s corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users “would have, more likely than not, been exposed,” the plaintiffs’ lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&amp;amp;J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: “I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson talc products,” Sanchez told the jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&amp;amp;J said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the company’s tests “consistently show no asbestos. Talc’s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&amp;amp;J’s $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker’s carefully tended image as a caring company – a “sacred cow,” as one 2003 internal email put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people really understand what’s going on, I think it increases J&amp;amp;J’s exposure a thousand-fold,” said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mounting controversy surrounding J&amp;amp;J talc hasn’t shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&amp;amp;J, based on the company’s Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had “strong grounds on appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: “We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorsky’s comment, echoed in countless J&amp;amp;J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure – 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&amp;amp;J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“SAFETY FIRST”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the “Safety First” motto. Johnson’s Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants’ diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson’s Baby Powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1950s, J&amp;amp;J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That’s one of six minerals – along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite – that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable “non-asbestiform” rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J’s worry at the time was that contaminants made the company’s powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much “grit” as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained “from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,” described as mostly fibrous and “acicular” tremolite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the authors of these and other J&amp;amp;J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&amp;amp;J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company’s talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was “cleavage fragments” from non-asbestiform tremolite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J’s original records don’t always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, “makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,” agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the product safety director for J&amp;amp;J’s talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: “(I)f a deposit contains ‘non-asbestiform’ tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“THE LUNGS OF BABIES”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1964, J&amp;amp;J’s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&amp;amp;J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&amp;amp;J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&amp;amp;J’s talc supply for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was “normal” to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&amp;amp;J rethink its approach. “Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,” Ashton wrote. “How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, “it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite … to an absolute minimum,” came the reply from another physician executive days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor told Ashton that J&amp;amp;J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder’s son and then-retired CEO, had expressed “concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have replied,” the doctor wrote, that “we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard.” Such assurances would be impossible, he added, “if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo is the earliest J&amp;amp;J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because “it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NEVER “100% CLEAN”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon’s newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They shared their preliminary findings with New York City’s environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA opened an inquiry. J&amp;amp;J issued a statement: “Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&amp;amp;J in a letter that the team had found a “relatively small” amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&amp;amp;J list of “antagonistic personalities” in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an “attack on talc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I suppose I was antagonistic,” Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&amp;amp;J powders in 1976, he didn’t find asbestos – a result that Mount Sinai announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langer said he told J&amp;amp;J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&amp;amp;J has not called him as a witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. “I said to myself, ‘How come it took so long?’ “ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 1971, meanwhile, J&amp;amp;J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&amp;amp;J shared “evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&amp;amp;J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company’s public relations department that J&amp;amp;J’s talc contained trace amounts of “fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&amp;amp;J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount “insignificant” and the samples “substantially free of asbestiform material.” J&amp;amp;J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the “results clearly show” the samples tested “contain no chrysotile asbestos.” J&amp;amp;J’s lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But J&amp;amp;J’s FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson’s finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample – “incontrovertible asbestos,” as he described it in a lab note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s own examinations found no asbestos in J&amp;amp;J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&amp;amp;J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: “I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&amp;amp;J’s Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&amp;amp;J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,” Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the “process may well be valuable property to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&amp;amp;J lawyer in New Jersey: “We will want to carefully consider the … patents re asbestos in talc. It’s quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J did not obtain the patents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&amp;amp;J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company’s Vermont mining operation. “Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,” he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. “And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J should “protect our powder franchise” by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that “no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles.” Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, “is obviously another answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicks told Reuters that J&amp;amp;J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&amp;amp;J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative “for defensive reasons” because “the thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after Petterson’s recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency’s cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, J&amp;amp;J’s Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&amp;amp;J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for “an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos.” That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA’s proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, “we may have problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&amp;amp;J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&amp;amp;J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company’s own researchers had earlier used to identify a “tremolite-type” asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: “It may be too sensitive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his email to Reuters, J&amp;amp;J’s lawyer said the lab supervisor’s concern was that the test would result in “false positives,” showing asbestos where there was none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA’s new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&amp;amp;J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,” the minutes state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&amp;amp;J told the FDA that since “a substantial safety factor can be expected” with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, “methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it “foolish,” adding, according to a J&amp;amp;J account of a February 1975 meeting: “No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&amp;amp;J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&amp;amp;J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,” the cover letter said. “We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its letter, J&amp;amp;J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected “in any sample.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J didn’t tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&amp;amp;J – “fiberform” actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as “asbestos fibers” in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. “Some of them seem rather high,” the private lab wrote in its cover letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicks, the J&amp;amp;J lawyer, said the contract lab’s results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found “was not asbestiform,” based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, “fibrous anthophyllite” and other types of asbestos had been “found in association with the Hammondsville ore body” – the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeitz’s May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc “strongly urged” the adoption of ways to protect “against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, “it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J’s selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge’s decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&amp;amp;J products caused cancer. “Providing the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,” Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“J&amp;amp;J respectfully disagrees with the Judge’s comments,” Bicks said. “J&amp;amp;J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&amp;amp;J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&amp;amp;J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-ray scanning is the primary method J&amp;amp;J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&amp;amp;J’s lawyer said the company’s tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&amp;amp;J’s X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the company never adopted the Colorado lab’s 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&amp;amp;J couldn’t guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as 1976, Ashton, J&amp;amp;J’s longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, “will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims.” He described this sort of testing as both “sophisticated” and “disturbing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“FREE OF HAZARD”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1977, J&amp;amp;J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&amp;amp;J’s “Defense of Talc Safety” campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be “free of hazard.” It attributed “this growing opinion” to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of “favorable data from the various J&amp;amp;J sponsored studies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&amp;amp;J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency’s investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. “So in subsequent analyses,” he told the paper, “we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, J&amp;amp;J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder – to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persistence of the industry’s view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It’s also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don’t apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc – even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&amp;amp;J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry’s position, saying on its website: “All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry’s standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States “should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as “carcinogenic to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the success of J&amp;amp;J’s efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company’s test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: “The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 1992, three years after J&amp;amp;J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on “important environmental issues” in its talc reserves that there was “past tremolite” in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&amp;amp;J memo, “were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&amp;amp;J divestiture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded – a finding deemed “BDL” – below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as “background asbestos” that did not come from any talc source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&amp;amp;J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. “I recognize the concern,” he told Reuters. He said the agency’s policing of cosmetics in general – fewer than 30 people regulating a “vast” industry – was “a place where we think we can be doing more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to “look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk.” An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining “scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“FISHING EXPEDITION”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn’t exceed OSHA limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why he zeroed in on Johnson’s Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&amp;amp;J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobson asked J&amp;amp;J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&amp;amp;J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;amp;J objected. Hobson’s “fishing expedition” would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson’s request could have turned up was a letter J&amp;amp;J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company’s Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite “asbestos” needles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker’s lung tissue. Before it came in, J&amp;amp;J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had “no evidence” Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker’s lung tissue contained tens of thousands of “long fibers” of four different types of asbestos. The findings were “consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,” the report concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,” Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&amp;amp;J’s dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without evidence from J&amp;amp;J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: “They knew what the problems were, and they hid it.” J&amp;amp;J’s records would have made a “100% difference” in Coker’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the information about asbestos in J&amp;amp;J’s talc come out earlier, he said, “maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure” for other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicks, the J&amp;amp;J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because “the discovery established that J&amp;amp;J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff’s disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coker’s daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,” Deckard said. “I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China’s Economy Slows Sharply</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;DONGGUAN, China — China’s consumers and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/business-confidence-growth&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt; are losing confidence. Car sales have plunged. The housing market is stumbling. Some factories are letting workers off for the big Lunar New Year holiday two months early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s economy has slowed sharply in recent months, presenting perhaps the biggest challenge to its top leader, Xi Jinping, in his six years of rule. At home, he faces difficult choices that could rekindle growth but add to the country’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/business/china-economy-trade.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;long-term problems&lt;/a&gt;, like its heavy debt. On the world stage, he has been forced &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/business/china-trade-war.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;to make concessions&lt;/a&gt; to the United States as President Trump’s trade war intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;How badly this hurts him could depend on the extent to which Chinese workers like Yu Hong find their jobs disappearing. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Yu, 46, was boarding a train home, to Hubei Province in central China, for a nearly three-month unpaid holiday. The lamp factory in Dongguan where he works had drastically reduced pay and cut hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The whole environment is different now,” Mr. Yu said. “For migrant workers like us, we just want to earn more money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Gauging the magnitude of the slowdown is difficult, given the unreliability of China’s economic data. But there are signs that the country’s problems are deepening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Friday, Chinese officials reported surprisingly weak growth in monthly retail sales and industrial production &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/china-markets-.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;weighing on global markets&lt;/a&gt; and helping to drag down the S&amp;amp;P 500-stock index by 1.9 percent. Many economists say the slowdown is the worst since the global financial crisis a decade ago, when Beijing was forced to plow trillions of dollars into its economy to keep growth from derailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Xi Jinping has likened China to an ocean that no storm can disturb, but the tempest now hitting it is by far the biggest” in years, said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics in London, who estimates that growth has fallen even lower than during the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Over the past two decades, a surging economy gave the Chinese leadership an ever bigger platform. Since China first sought to join the World Trade Organization and host the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing hasn’t had to turn for help to Washington or other major world capitals. Long a source of growth, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/25/world/asia/china-economy-strategy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a stabilizing influence during the global financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;, China has generally negotiated from a position of strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Xi doesn’t have that luxury anymore. He has solidified control over ever more of Chinese political and social life and the economy. This year, he removed term limits, setting himself up to be president for life if he chooses. While the trade war with the United States provides a handy scapegoat, public blame for a prolonged downturn could ultimately fall on him. Already the government has ordered that bad economic news &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/china-censor-economic-news.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;be censored&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Xi now faces more of a diplomatic balancing act. The Chinese authorities have detained two Canadian nationals, in apparent retaliation for Canada’s arrest of a top Chinese telecommunications executive at the behest of Washington. But Chinese officials have struck a quieter tone with the Trump administration over the arrest and separate allegations of hacking, since a sharp escalation in the trade war could seriously damage the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;President Trump already senses an advantage. “China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them,” he tweeted on Friday. (The slowdown began before the imposition of the tariffs, but they have hurt both business and consumer confidence and will probably pinch even more if they linger or intensify.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Thanks to the government’s tight hold on important industries and the financial sector, it has more levers to pull in case of a downturn than practically any other country. Beijing’s efforts in the spring to wean the economy off debt, a major cause of the slowdown, are now being reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Already, China has ramped up the sort of government-led spending that bailed out its economy in the past. At Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant that supplies many highway and rail builders, sales have jumped 50 percent from a year ago, said Wang Min, the company’s chairman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Regulators have also ordered banks to lend more to private businesses. Ministers have promised to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2018-12/05/content_5345808.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;compensate businesses&lt;/a&gt; for not laying off workers. Environmental controls are being less stringently enforced, making it easier for polluting factories to stay open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some economists believe growth will improve by the middle of next year. And China so far appears to have avoided &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/920501468221678504/pdf/WPS5984.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;huge job losses&lt;/a&gt; like those it saw during the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But China’s options for juicing the economy aren’t as effective as they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A small but notable rise in defaults in China has made some lenders nervous. Rules adopted since the financial crisis make China’s bank managers responsible for life for loans that aren’t repaid, and that has them more leery of extending financing to keep troubled businesses afloat. Government-led spending adds to the huge debt pile, making that long-term drag on growth even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On paper as always, the Chinese economy looks fine. Official data shows it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/business/china-economy-third-quarter.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;grew 6.5 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the three months that ended in September, compared with a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But beneath the surface, a sharp slowdown is building. Foreign investment plunged last month. Auto sales over the past three months have fallen by record percentages. Floor space completed, one gauge of the housing market’s health, has slumped this year. Sentiment among Chinese purchasing managers has soured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We don’t have much to do, so I decided to go home and rest,” said Li Shulian, a 46-year-old worker at a Dongguan plastics factory, as she stood at a train station with her husband, her teenage daughter and several suitcases. Their factory gave them a week off in October and nearly a week in November, both times with almost no pay. Overtime pay also vanished, so Ms. Li’s monthly earnings were nearly halved to $435.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Told early this month that the three of them would be working — and paid — only on alternate days, they quit and bought tickets on the nearly 12-hour train back to their hometown in central China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I haven’t gone home this early for the holidays since I left my hometown in 2005,” Ms. Li said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Businesses say they are cutting hours as demand has slowed. In part, they have room to cut back because many factories were previously running full out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“You quite easily can reduce overtime,” said Jochem Heizmann, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group China, which directly and through joint ventures employs 100,000 Chinese workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e1olku6u0&quot;&gt;A garment factory in Guangzhou, China. A construction worker in the area said he had worked only two weeks in the past month, as developers across China ran low on cash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e18m0s9i0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1afaoz0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The slowdown is palpable in southern China’s manufacturing capitals of Guangzhou and Dongguan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This year, people are just going home earlier than before,” said Judy Zhu, who runs a small shop selling cheap plastic suitcases outside a Dongguan train station. Her busiest time is usually January, when the Lunar New Year holiday typically begins, but this year her sales picked up early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Li Xiaohong, a 50-year-old construction worker, stood near a job recruitment storefront on the outskirts of Guangzhou. Handwritten signs advertised low-wage jobs, but most had age limits. None went up to 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Li said he had worked only two weeks in the past month, as real estate developers across China ran low on cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I used to be very busy working 12 hours a day, with only three to five days’ rest in a month,” Mr. Li said. “Now, we don’t have much work to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Employers are becoming more cautious about whom they hire, government and private sector surveys show. Not surprisingly, fewer people appear to be job-hopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“They do not dare to quit without being able to find another one,” said Lei Kaifeng, a labor recruiter at a hiring hall in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The big question is what will happen next year, particularly in coastal areas dependent on exports to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Many supply chains to the United States are stuffed with extra inventory thanks to stockpiling, so American importers may need fewer goods in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I am still panicked now, afraid of facing a winter for business next year,” said Cyril Liu, a 23-year-old engineer in southeastern China, who was recently sent home for a nine-day unpaid vacation because his employer, a manufacturer of printed circuit boards, has few orders. “Many friends in small businesses are worried about their jobs next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Experts Urge U.S. To Continue Support for Nuclear Fusion Research</title>
<link>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-urge-u-s-to-continue-support-for-nuclear-fusion-research/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-urge-u-s-to-continue-support-for-nuclear-fusion-research/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel of 19 scientists drawn from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommended yesterday that the Department of Energy should continue an international experiment on nuclear fusion energy and then develop its own plan for a “compact power plant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts envision that it could become a model for future plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing tremendous progress being made in the path to achieving fusion energy around the world,” said Michael Mauel, a professor of applied physics at Columbia University and co-chair of the panel. “Now is the right time for the U.S. to benefit from the investments in burning plasma research and take leadership in fusion energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of a reactor that can produce electricity from nuclear fusion will have major importance in the fight against climate change. If it emerges as projected around 2050, a commercial version of the plant would produce almost emission-free energy because its main fuel consists of two hydrogen isotopes—deuterium and tritium — that can be obtained from water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike current nuclear power plants, which get their energy by splitting slightly enriched fuel from uranium—a process called fission—a fusion plant derives energy from forcing two hydrogen atoms together. It’s the same process that powers the sun. While conventional nuclear power creates a large amount of long-lived and toxic nuclear wastes, a fusion-powered plant is expected to create almost none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of harnessing fusion power would also have major economic implications because countries that develop and commercialize it may enjoy considerable benefits from cheaper electricity and from deploying related scientific innovations that are expected to come with the so-called nuclear power plant of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the National Academies’ report noted, major challenges must be overcome to reach these goals, beginning with how to contain and control a burning “plasma” of extremely hot gas, ranging from 100 million to 200 million degrees Celsiuss, that can produce more heat than it consumes. The report calls the resulting plasma “a miniature sun confined inside a vessel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s biggest experiment intended to create and draw energy from burning plasma is under construction at Cadarache, France. It’s called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, and its centerpiece is a large, doughnut-shaped, Russian-inspired reactor called a tokamak. The idea is to use a powerful magnetic field to hold the super-hot plasma in place—so its heat can be extracted without incinerating the walls of the reactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Academies report notes that ITER came together in 2007 with help and financing from a consortium of parties, including the United States, Russia, China, India, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. In its early years it experienced major cost overruns, and by 2013, its “schedule had slipped by more than a decade,” according to an earlier NAS report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several member nations have already developed their own national programs, and the assembled National Academies experts concluded that the United States should eventually follow, once the ITER experiment shows there are ways to contain and manipulate a sustained fusion reaction. “It is the next critical step in the development of fusion energy,” says the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a partner in ITER, U.S. scientists have developed some of the components of the Cadarache facility and visited fusion facilities and other member countries. By 2016, according to the National Academies panel, the United States had contributed $1.13 billion to ITER, roughly 9 percent of its costs. It can be expected to contribute another $2.2 billion over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding its own fusion program now and then using the additional science and engineering to develop a smaller, more economical fusion pilot plant, once the experience of running the ITER reactor has been studied, the National Academies estimates the United States would have to spend up to $200 million annually for several decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the results would help the Department of Energy, which commissioned the National Academies study, to develop more U.S. experimental centers, which would attract more scientists and cooperation from electric utilities and others needed to help develop fully commercial fusion power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative of withdrawing from ITER could isolate U.S. scientists, while other countries move ahead with complex engineering and science innovations. That isolation could make fusion more costly for the United States, according to the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakthroughs needed to overcome the challenges of fusion power could spawn advances in a “wide variety of fields in science and technology,” including in the fields of optics, fluid mechanics and biophysics, the report says. The impacts could “touch every aspect of our lives,” according to an earlier National Academies study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Diego-based General Atomics has been among the U.S. companies involved in one of ITER’s challenges, which is to manufacture a 1,000-ton superconducting electromagnet designed to initiate and control hot plasma for fusion energy. It is one of the most powerful magnets ever built. Each of its six modules projects the energy equivalent of 1,000 cars racing at 100 mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Atomics noted in a press release that the power in its big magnets will be needed to unleash and control the much greater power potential of “carbon free” fusion energy “without long term waste.” A fusion power plant, it estimated, “could use only 5 kilograms [11 pounds] of hydrogen to generate the energy equivalent of 18,750 tons of coal, 56,000 barrels of oil or 755 acres of solar panels.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CenturyLink is blocking customer internet, saying Utah legislators told them to</title>

<description>&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;We've all experienced frustration with the internet going down. Now imagine how frustrated you'd be if you found out that your ISP &lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; blocked your internet access for the purpose of advertising their software; and better yet, your ISP claimed that state legislators required them to do it! Well that's exactly what is happening to CenturyLink customers in Utah right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;5.7315436241611&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CenturyLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;@CenturyLink&lt;/a&gt; block my internet and then inject this page into my browser (dns spoofing I think) to advertise their paid filtering software to me. Clicking OK on the notice then restored my internet... this is NOT okay! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NtCZUeJF8I&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NtCZUeJF8I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;A few days ago while watching TV through my FireTV the stream unexpectedly went black. After trying to debug the issue for a bit with no success I went to my computer, which was still connected to my ISP, but was also experiencing a strange lack of internet. Eventually I turned to a Google search on my phone only to be immediately greeted with an official looking notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.richsnapp.com/_nuxt/img/beaa8a6.jpg&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;At first glance I was worried that I had somehow been redirected to a malicious website and that this was some kind of phishing attempt... After all, I didn't navigate here. I attempted to do another search but still ended up at this same notice. I considered the idea that maybe my ISP had detected some kind of threat coming from my network and that's why I was seeing this official looking page. Eventually, after reading over the page several times, I clicked &quot;OK&quot; and my internet was back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your Internet service has been fully restored ... Thanks for your business. &lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;CenturyLink High-Speed Internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;What...? I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centurylink.com/home/ease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;the page CenturyLink referred to in the notice&lt;/a&gt; so I could see what was so important that it necessitated blocking me from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Centurylink @Ease puts the best names in computer security to work for you – industry leaders like Norton for AntiVirus protection and Identity Guard to help protect your identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$5 off per month for the first two months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was an &lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;advertisement&lt;/em&gt; for security products! ...and not very good ones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;I went to Twitter to see if I was the only one having this very bizarre experience and it turns out I was not alone. Fellow Utahns were also expressing their discontent with CenturyLink's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.398773006135&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s always a fun day when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CenturyLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;@centurylink&lt;/a&gt; blocks your internet access until you go to troubleshoot the problem and are forced to read a letter about filtering services they offer before they will restore your internet. Wow what a cool way to hold us hostage! Total bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Eventually I stumbled upon a reddit thread, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/a4csu8/any_century_link_customers_lose_internet_until/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Any century link customers lose internet until you read the filter message?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered this behavior has been going on for quite some time with users mentioning it had also happened to them in the previous weeks. One of the reddit users specifically pointed out that this was most likely a &quot;ham-fisted&quot; approach by CenturyLink to comply with the provisions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/SB0134.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;S.B. 134&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;word-break-normal&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;(b) (i) A service provider shall, before December 30, 2018, notify in a conspicuous manner all of the service provider's consumers with a Utah residential address that the consumer may request material harmful to minors be blocked under Subsection (1)(a).
(ii) A service provider may provide the notice described in Subsection (2)(b)(i):
 (A) by electronic communication;
 (B) with a consumer's bill; or
 (C) in another conspicuous manner.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Relevant excerpt from Utah S.B. 134
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now I finally realized what was going on. CenturyLink was using the unethical practice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;DNS Hijacking&lt;/a&gt; to push notifications (or in this case, advertisements) of products to customers and using Utah law as justification. For the lucky customers, they'll only have their internet browsing session interrupted for no reason, acknowledge they saw the ad, and move on. If they're using a streaming device, such as a FireTV or Chromecast, they'll have their video stop and receive no notification. If you're browsing the internet on a device not using CenturyLink's DNS (maybe using GoogleDNS or OpenDNS), your internet will stop working, you'll see no notice, and you'll either waste time debugging the issue (like me) or give up and waste hours talking to CenturyLink support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Curious if this is really what Utah legislators were intending, I reached out to the listed sponsor of the bill on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8.390438247012&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;I have yet to see an internet response that appreciates them doing this, but I see a lot of angry and upset people on twitter and reddit. This is such a terribly dumb idea, was this the intent of your bill?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.5277777777778&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’m sorry you are having problems. SB134 did not require that — and no other ISP has done that to comply with the law. They were only required to notify customers of options via email or with an invoice.&lt;/p&gt;
— Todd Weiler (@gopTODD) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gopTODD/status/1072189463252488192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;December 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;CenturyLink is much less helpful on twitter, replying to any comments on this shady behavior with what is most likely their contextually unaware automated customer service bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where I go from here, I'm not sure. I would switch ISPs but I have no other options where I live. Hopefully making this issue more public will help CenturyLink make better decisions, but when you consider our administration's recent successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;repeal of net neutrality earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, we'll probably just need to start accepting this kind of behavior as the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Shame Storm</title>
<link>https://www.firstthings.com/article/2019/01/shame-storm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.firstthings.com/article/2019/01/shame-storm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;fter a lifetime of impeccably correct opinions, Ian Buruma found himself on the wrong side of the liberal consensus in September 2018, when he was forced to resign as editor of the &lt;em&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/em&gt; for having commissioned a piece called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/11/reflections-hashtag/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reflections from a Hashtag&lt;/a&gt;” from the disgraced Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi. One does not get to be editor of the NYRB without having filament-like sensitivity to the boundaries of acceptable opinion. Buruma’s virtuosic handling in 2007 of the controversy over his &lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt; profile of Tariq Ramadan, in which he wrote indulgently of his subject’s radical Islamic views—and scathingly of Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s secularist opposition to them—was a model of politically correct equipoise. If Buruma was caught flat-footed this time, it must be the times that have changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Leon Wieseltier, Lorin Stein, ­Garrison Keillor, John Hockenberry, Ryan Lizza, or any of the other editors and journalists who have lost their jobs in the last twelve months due to the movement known as #MeToo, Buruma was not accused of any sexual misconduct. His crime was to give space in his magazine to a man who had been accused (but not, in any of four court cases, convicted) of sexual harassment and non-consensual roughness during sex. Buruma told &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; in an interview five days before his resignation, “I think nobody has quite figured out what should happen in cases like his, where you have been legally acquitted but you are still judged as undesirable in public opinion, and how far that should go, how long that should last.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too true, as Buruma found out to his cost. No one has yet figured out what rules should govern the new frontiers of public shaming that the Internet has opened. New rules are obviously required. Shame is now both global and permanent, to a degree ­unprecedented in human history. No more moving to the next town to escape your bad name. However far you go and however long you wait, your disgrace is only ever a Google search away. Getting a humiliating story into the papers used to require convincing an editor to run it, which meant passing their standards of newsworthiness and corroborating evidence. Those gatekeepers are now gone. Most attempts so far to devise new rules have taken ideology as their starting point: Shaming is okay as long as it’s directed at men by women, the powerless against the powerful. But that doesn’t address what to do afterward, if someone is found to have been wrongfully shamed, or when someone rightfully shamed wants to put his life back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the essay that got Buruma fired, Ghomeshi claims to have been a pioneer in online shaming. “There are lots of guys more hated than me now. But I was the guy everyone hated &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;.” Actually, a better candidate for original victim is Justine Sacco, the PR executive who tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers before getting on a plane to Cape Town, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!” It was during the Christmas holidays when news is always slow, so a Gawker post about the tweet quickly went viral. People around the world were soon enjoying the suspense of knowing Sacco was on a plane with no Internet access and no way to know that she had become an object of global ridicule. That was in December 2013, almost a year before the Ghomeshi story broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before that, in the Precambrian era of online shaming, there was me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2010, I appeared on a panel to promote a book of essays by young conservatives, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Proud-Be-Right-Conservative-Generation/dp/0061965731?tag=firstthings20-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Proud to Be Right: Voices of the Next Conservative Generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The moderator was Jonah Goldberg. One of the other panelists was my ex-boyfriend Todd Seavey. During the Q&amp;amp;A, Todd launched into a rant about my personal failings. He accused me of opposing Obamacare on the grounds that it would diminish human suffering, which allegedly I preferred to increase; of wanting to repeal laws against fistfights for the same reason; of being a sadistic and scheming heartbreaker in my personal life; and of generally living according to a “disturbing” and “brutal” set of values. For three minutes and forty-five seconds, which, unfortunately for me, were captured on film for broadcast two weeks later on C-SPAN2, he made an impassioned case that I was a sociopath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd is not a psychologist, but a psychologist with no evidence to go on except my treatment of Todd might well have arrived at the same conclusion. I treated him awfully. I can only plead in mitigation that I was twenty-two. Todd is from Connecticut and has that charming New England stolidity, and I behaved as if his patience, which seemed so infinite when we were dating, really had no limits. The bit about opposing Obamacare because I favored human suffering was outlandish, and other parts of his rant were not quite how I remembered things, but everything he said&lt;em&gt;, he really believed&lt;/em&gt;, and he had arrived at those beliefs by a hard road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I braced myself for the broadcast. Maybe no one would notice? Within minutes, the offending clip had been posted on YouTube, where it got half a million hits in the first forty-eight hours. It made the evening news on Washington’s Fox affiliate. Greg Gutfeld did a segment about it on &lt;em&gt;RedEye&lt;/em&gt;. It was written up in Gawker, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Talking Points Memo, and a hundred lesser sites, and then written up again when Todd expanded his remarks about me into a ­series of blog posts on his personal website. My inbox exploded with media inquiries, none of which I answered, except to give a short statement to Mary Katharine Ham at the &lt;em&gt;Daily Caller&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say it was all a plan hatched by our new media consultant, who told us we had to “think outside the box” to make our C-SPAN panel “go viral,” but no, it is exactly what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of policy, I don’t comment on my personal life in public, but I will clarify that his tirade thoroughly mischaracterizes my political views. For instance, I do not believe that laws against assault should be repealed—nor do I think there should be an exception in cases when one’s ex-boyfriend behaves unacceptably on national television, though I admit that’s a tougher question. Nor do I oppose Obamacare for the contorted reason he states—I oppose it for the usual reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the personal friends who emailed commiserations, I replied with an old Aaron Sorkin line about bad publicity: “It’s like seasickness. You think you’re gonna die, and everyone else just thinks it’s funny.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, it turned out, was overly optimistic. Everyone at work was supportive (“if you want us to form the committee to horsewhip todd seavey, just say the word,” one colleague emailed, bless him), but no amount of support could counteract the paranoia that settled in over the next weeks and months. My colleagues probably didn’t believe the woman they worked alongside was secretly a comic-book ­villain—but surely the suspicion had been planted? I never knew whether someone on the subway was giving me a second glance because he knew me, or because he recognized me from the video. Fellow journalists reported back to me from conferences where Todd expatiated on my depravity at length—in one case, before an audience that included my boss. An old friend called to say he had posted a supportive comment about me at the &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt; and shortly after received an email from Todd, who had guessed his identity from his screen name, explaining all the reasons I did not deserve to be defended. I wondered how many such incidents I never heard about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to process the experience intellectually. I read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Jim-Tale-Penguin-Classics/dp/B009CPISLC?tag=firstthings20-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lord Jim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/House-Mirth-Twentieth-Century-Classics/dp/0140187294?tag=firstthings20-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The House of Mirth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. No grand lesson presented itself, which, in a way, was lucky. It meant there was no ideological interpretation I could superimpose on my experience, which would have slowed my progress toward acceptance by allowing me to indulge in resentment and indignation. I couldn’t tell myself it had happened because I was a woman. Had the genders been reversed, I probably would have received less sympathy than I did. I could not blame society, or C-SPAN, or ­Jonah ­Goldberg. A year and a half later, when I was looking for a new job, I could not even blame the prospective employers who demonstrated a marked reluctance to bring me in for interviews. If I had to choose between a candidate whom no one had ever called a sociopath on national television, and one who probably wasn’t a psycho but &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be, I would play it safe, too, even if the probability was only a fraction of a percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, I decided I would rather be Lord Jim than Lily Bart, so I accepted an offer from my boyfriend (now husband) to move with him to Australia—the best decision I ever made. On my last night in New York, in a burst of either sentimentality or bravado, I called Todd. We met in Midtown for a drink, and I found, to my surprise, that there was nothing I particularly wanted to say to him. If I was looking for some kind of closure, I wasn’t ready for it yet. In the end I had only one question for him: When we were chatting in the courtyard before the panel, was it some kind of deliberate foreshadowing when he mentioned how much he always liked Pink Floyd’s &lt;em&gt;The Wall&lt;/em&gt; and started singing a song from the album that goes, “Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers”? He said it was just a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to the other side of the world did not diminish the video’s place in my life as much as I thought it would. It was still the first result when you Googled my name, which presumably is one reason I couldn’t find a job for the first eighteen months. Eventually, I found a position at a think tank. When I released my first report, an Australian MP tweeted a link to the video and asked why anyone should care about this nutcase’s opinions on regulation. Even after I got married and took my husband’s last name, the video still popped up on social media when I did a TV appearance or had an op-ed in the paper. In 2017, when I moved back to Washington, D.C., and started meeting some of the younger writers in town, it took them less than a week to find the clip and ask me about it. Most of them had been in high school when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a funny coincidence, the day I began writing this essay, my husband was attending a conference of free-market activists when his lunch table started talking about bad breakups in the conservative movement. One man pulled out his iPhone and said, “If you want to talk about bad conservative breakups, you have to see this.” He put the phone away when Tim told him that the woman in the video was his wife. That was eight years and twenty-one days since the broadcast first aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here is a celebrity fashion blog called Go Fug Yourself that specializes—or specialized back in 2011, the one and only time I visited the site—in unflattering paparazzi shots and red carpet disasters. The odd thing about Go Fug Yourself, I discovered, was that all its nastiest posts featured the same tic. After unloading whatever brutal snark she had for Jennifer Lawrence or whomever, the writer would always include the same disclaimer: &lt;em&gt;A celebrity has&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;one job&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and that’s to look glamorous, so if you can’t manage the one thing you owe us in exchange for all the money and fame, then find another line of work, and until then lay off the cheeseburgers and hire a decent stylist&lt;/em&gt;. This dime-store Joan Rivers can’t think she’s fooling anyone, I thought as I scrolled through the archives to see if every post really included this lame moral alibi. Her motivation has nothing to do with celebrities falling short of their duty to the public. She’s making fun of ugliness for the same reason anyone does: It stimulates our lizard brains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who read the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; are smarter than the readers of Go Fug Yourself, but sometimes smarter people don’t make better decisions; they just come up with better excuses. Kevin Williamson was fired by the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; in April 2018 over an unearthed audio recording in which he said that abortion was a form of murder and should carry the same punishment, up to and including the death penalty. The aspect of the resulting Twitter storm that surprised me was not the way his statement was warped out of context into a defense of lynch justice for pregnant teenagers but the purported concern for his female coworkers. “How can you say that you want a workplace that values women when you hire someone who wants 25% of those women dead?” asked feminist Jessica Valenti. When Williamson’s firing was announced, in a memo that made delicate reference to “the values of our workplace,” Valenti responded, “I am very relieved for the women who work at the magazine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of insulting the reader: No one actually believed Williamson was a threat to his female colleagues. It was only a pretext for what was really an exercise in raw power. People made the same kind of excuses when it was my turn in the dunk tank. Again and again, I read commenters insisting that what might at first glance appear to be prurient gossip was, in fact, fair political commentary, because I was a family-values scold and thus open to charges of hypocrisy, or because I was a hard-core Randian who needed a lesson in the dog-eat-dog heartlessness advocated by my idol. As far as I can tell, these characterizations were extrapolated from the fact that I worked at &lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt;. Certainly, they had no basis in anything I’d written (an Objectivist, really?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more online shame cycles you observe, the more obvious the pattern becomes: Everyone comes up with a principled-sounding pretext that serves as a barrier against admitting to themselves that, in fact, all they have really done is joined a mob. Once that barrier is erected, all rules of decency go out the window, but the pretext is almost always a lie. ­Matthew Yglesias once claimed that the reason he mocked David Brooks for his divorce was because Brooks had written columns about the social value of marriage, but I do not believe him. He did it because it’s fun to humiliate your political opponents. Moira Donegan claims that she created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shittymediamenlist.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shitty Media Men List&lt;/a&gt;—a clearinghouse of anonymous accusations optimally parked for maximum dissemination in the Google Spreadsheet cloud—for altruistic reasons and with no thought of its being used to hurt anyone, but I do not believe her. If it was about protecting women in media from harassment, then why no attempt to sort the true accusations from the false? Why the coy protestations that “I thought that the document would not be made public,” when of course she knew that it would be spread far and wide, or she wouldn’t have bothered creating it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donegan’s defenders do not behave like people interested in finding the truth. They stirred up a Twitter mob against Katie Roiphe before her &lt;em&gt;Harper’s&lt;/em&gt; piece about the Shitty Media Men List was even published. Claims to be motivated by concern about possible backlash against Donegan, if Roiphe revealed her as the creator of the list, were more than a little disingenuous. Since being outed, Donegan has gotten a book deal with Simon &amp;amp; Schuster and a regular column in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, which is precisely what anyone could have predicted. When John Hockenberry, also in &lt;em&gt;Harper’s&lt;/em&gt;, wrote about his experience being #MeToo’d out of his job at NPR, admitting some charges and explaining why he thought others were bogus, his detractors did not bother refuting his case. They simply ridiculed him. And no one has offered him a book deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator/dp/1591846285?tag=firstthings20-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Ryan Holiday’s memoir of his years as a PR consultant, he describes a roundtable meeting at the &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; where the editors discussed how a certain big company should have handled its recent PR crisis. The editors offered the usual bromides: “Transparency is critical.” “Be proactive.” “Get out in front of it.” Holiday replied, “None of you know what you’re talking about.” The old rules don’t apply in the free-for-all world of online journalism, and they especially don’t work when the figure at the center of the controversy is one lonely individual. If a client came to him because he was being called a racist or sexist on Twitter, Holiday says (pardon the vulgarity), “I would tell him to bend over and take it. And then I’d apologize. I’d tell him the whole system is broken and evil, and I’m sorry it’s attacking him. But there’s nothing that can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to defend yourself or clarify your original remarks is “the equivalent of a squeaky cry of, ‘Why is everyone making fun of me?!’ on the playground,” Holiday says. “Whether it happens in front of snarky blogs or a real-life bully, the result is the same: Everyone makes fun of you even more.” The idea that online shaming is a form of debate—or in any way oriented toward finding the truth—is a delusion. Dialogue is not the point. The day Brett ­Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;—not Gawker, but the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;—ran thirty-two Kavanaugh headlines in twenty-four hours, many of them on the subject of the nominee’s supposed whininess: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tears-of-brett-kavanaugh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Tears of Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/a&gt;”; “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/an-angry-tearful-opening-to-kavanaughs-part-of-the-hearing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;An Angry, Tearful Opening&lt;/a&gt;”; “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/brett-kavanaughs-damaging-revealing-partisan-bitterness-supreme-court-confirmation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brett Kavanaugh’s ­Damaging, Revealing Partisan Bitterness&lt;/a&gt;”; “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-ford-kavanaugh-hearings-will-be-remembered-for-their-grotesque-display-of-patriarchal-resentment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Grotesque Display of Patriarchal Resentment&lt;/a&gt;.” The man had been accused of being a brutal rapist, and the most prestigious magazine in America ridiculed him for responding to the allegation as any innocent man would have. No, dialogue is not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was debating whether or not to write this essay, which, after all, revisits an unpleasant incident that has long been at least semi-­dormant, if not quite forgotten, I saw a headline in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/nyregion/man-found-dead-in-car-new-york.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;His Body Was Behind the Wheel a Week Before It Was Discovered&lt;/a&gt;.” The man, Geoffrey Corbis, had committed suicide in a parked car in the East Village. Only his name wasn’t really Geoffrey Corbis, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; explained. He had been born Geoffrey Weglarz. He changed it after an incident in 2013 at a ­McDonald’s near his home in Connecticut, when he threw a sandwich at a pregnant server who had given him the wrong order. Newspaper coverage of this funny local fracas did not mention Weglarz’s recent divorce or long-term unemployment after leaving his job as a computer programmer at Dell. He couldn’t find work with the McDonald’s story at the top of his Google results, hence the attempt at a fresh start as Geoffrey Corbis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens more often than you would think. At least half a dozen cases mentioned in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Image-Privacy-Publicity-America/dp/0804791449?tag=firstthings20-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Laws of ­Image: Privacy and Publicity in America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, ­Samantha Barbas’s 2015 history of shame and libel, end with suicides. Jon Ronson’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/So-Youve-Been-Publicly-Shamed/dp/1594634017?tag=firstthings20-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; describes an English chef, living in France, who killed himself after his wife-swapping hobby was revealed by the &lt;em&gt;News of the World&lt;/em&gt;. It also tells of a rural Welsh preacher who found himself the subject of a photo spread in the same publication for hosting an orgy in his caravan—after which he, too, killed himself. Most victims of public shaming aren’t nationally famous editors like Ian Buruma. They are ordinary folks like “ID Adam,” who lost his job at a box assembly company in Winston-Salem after reports that he racially profiled a black woman at a community pool. It turned out that he, as the pool chair on duty, had asked to see her ID, because, when signing in, she had given an address on a street in the neighborhood where no houses had yet been built. It took him days to get his side of the story into the papers, and it didn’t make him any less fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essay about public shaming should have advice for those people, I thought. When I couldn’t think of any, I called Todd. He had, after all, suffered quite as much from the C-SPAN2 fallout as I had. He left his job at Fox—not right away, but after three months, when he refused to sign a statement from HR saying that such TV appearances were a violation of their “outside media” policy, even though they had never expressed a problem with his extracurricular projects before. Four years later, he returned to the NewsCorp building to film a segment on the &lt;em&gt;Kennedy&lt;/em&gt; show, only to be stopped in the lobby by security and told he was on a no-admit list. He makes a living as a ghostwriter now, and his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Libertarianism-Beginners-Todd-Seavey/dp/1939994667?tag=firstthings20-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Libertarianism for Beginners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was published to positive reviews in 2016. When I asked if he would do it over again if he had the choice, he said he is now a believer in handling things privately. “In the future, if I get married, if my wife &lt;em&gt;stabs&lt;/em&gt; me, you won’t hear me shouting in public about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things really can get so much bigger than you and your own efforts that you just kind of have to ride the wave,” Todd said. “I was obscure enough before that any public attention I got was the result of me trying really hard.” He told me he never expected the clip to go as viral as it did, “far beyond my ability to control or even monitor,” which sounded implausible—until I remembered just how unfamiliar these online shame cycles were in the years before Justine Sacco’s tweet. Todd thought he would say his piece—which, in his mind, was not just that I was a bad girlfriend, but that I had a “cruelty-based worldview” that future editors and employers should be warned against unwittingly promoting by giving me work—and that would be that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd’s advice for our fellow-shamed was no better than mine. “When a tsunami is heading for your house, at a certain point you have to say, ‘I’m just gonna stand here and hold this piece of plywood and see what’s left standing when it’s all over.’” Arguing back is no use. “If you’re tweeting, you’re losing.” Even in the immediate aftermath of the C-SPAN2 incident, when Todd, on his blog, attempted to make his case at length against my evil beliefs, he saw his arguments get lost in the maelstrom—equally ignored by both supporters and detractors. If we had a breakthrough in our conversation, that was it: There is no content to a shame storm. It is mindless by its very nature. It is indifferent to truth, even in cases where the truth could possibly be determined. Therefore, like the Ring, it cannot be used for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution, then, is not to try to make shame storms well targeted, but to make it so they happen as infrequently as possible. Editors should refuse to run stories that have no value except humiliation, and readers should refuse to click on them. It is, after all, the moral equivalent of contributing your rock to a public stoning. We should all develop a robust sense of what is and is not any of our business. Shame can be useful—and even necessary—but it is toxic unless a relationship exists between two people first. A Twitter mob is no more a basis for salutary shaming than an actual mob is for reasoned discussion. That would be true even if the shaming’s relics were not preserved forever by Google, making any kind of rehabilitation impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Stephen Elliott has his way, would-be shamers will have to consult more than just their consciences. He is suing Moira Donegan for defamation over her media men list, in which his entry reads: “Rape accusations, sexual harassment, coercion, unsolicited invitations to his apartment, a dude who snuck into Binders???” (Binders is a Facebook group for women writers.) What it means to be accused of “rape accusations” will doubtless be clarified at trial. It sounds like the person who wrote this was speaking from rumor herself, which proves how cavalierly career-ending allegations of sexual assault are now thrown around. I have no legal opinion on whether Elliott’s lawsuit will be for #MeToo what Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan’s heroic lawsuit was for Gawker, but, unless we all begin to respond more responsibly to public shaming, we can expect to see more attempts to (as President Trump put it) “open up our libel laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;s for the people who find themselves at the center of an online shaming, I can only report how I made peace with mine. Ironically, the disagreement that gave Todd the idea that I had a “cruelty-based worldview” was over my belief that suffering is sometimes necessary for personal growth, and an essential part of God’s plan for our salvation—a belief that, as a strict utilitarian, Todd completely rejects. We had a dozen fights about it. The irony, of course, is that there is no belief my brush with online shaming confirmed more. I had heard the maxim that there is no humility without humiliation—how true it proved. My first reaction to the video was to feel aggrieved, thinking that I did not deserve what was happening to me, but on the Day of Judgment all my sins will be shouted from the housetops, and Todd’s rant will sound like a retirement luncheon toast in comparison. Of course I deserved it, and worse; most of us poor sinners do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all history’s martyrs to shame, the one whose example consoled me most was Oscar Wilde. He is remembered today as a gay rights pioneer, but, in the letters he wrote after his release from prison, he never rails against the injustice of the law that put him away. He did not think it was a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; law, he simply believed that the justice or injustice of the charge against him was irrelevant. What mattered was that he had been rescued from his own pride and selfishness by his experience, when he could not have been saved by any gentler medicine. This lesson, which produced “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/ballad-reading-gaol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&lt;/a&gt;” (“I know not whether Laws be right, / Or whether Laws be wrong”), he put into plain prose in a letter written during his exile in July 1897. Sporus was the slave boy that emperor Nero freed and “married”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, suffering seems now a sacramental thing, that makes those whom it touches holy. I think I am in many respects a much better fellow than I was, and I now make no more exorbitant claims on life: I accept everything. I am sure it is all right. I was living a life unworthy of an artist, and though I do not hold with the British view of morals that sets Messalina above Sporus, I see that any materialism in life coarsens the soul, and that the hunger of the body and the appetites of the flesh desecrate always, and often destroy. . . . I learnt many things in prison that were terrible to learn, but I learnt some good lessons that I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man to whom this letter was addressed was Carlos Blacker, who himself had fled England for France in 1890, when he was accused of being a card cheat. The charge against Blacker happened to be false, just as the charge against Wilde happened to be true, but that made no difference in the two men’s experiences. The truth that Wilde came to understand, which he shared with his fellow exile, was that they should accept their chastening in a spirit of gratitude. Nothing had been taken from them that would not be restored a hundredfold if they allowed their ­experience to do its redemptive work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Facebook on Friday &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/12/14/notifying-our-developer-ecosystem-about-a-photo-api-bug/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that a major software bug may have allowed third-party apps to wrongly access the photos of up to 6.8 million users, including images that people began uploading to the site but didn’t post publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The mishap, which occurred over a 12-day period in September, adds to Facebook’s mounting privacy headaches after incidents earlier this year in which it failed to fully safeguard the personal data of its users. It has already prompted European regulators to investigate — and brought fresh calls for the company to be fined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;In general, Facebook allows apps by third-party developers to obtain users' permission and access photos shared on their timeline. Because of the bug, though, roughly 1,500 apps could access “a broader set of photos than usual,” Facebook explained in a blog post. That includes photos that a user may have started to post, but abandoned before actually publishing, because Facebook keeps a copy of the draft in the event a user might want to finish uploading it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The software bug also may have allowed developers to access photos they weren’t supposed to on Marketplace, a Facebook hub for users to buy and sell goods, and some posted in Stories, where users can share short photo or video updates that appear for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Facebook’s latest revelation drew sharp rebukes from privacy advocates. “It’s stunning that Facebook has the ability to send user photos to third parties when the user has not fully uploaded the photo,&quot; said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “It’s like a provider sending draft emails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;In response, Facebook apologized to users on Friday. “Early next week we will be rolling out tools for app developers that will allow them to determine which people using their app might be impacted by this bug,&quot; the company said. &quot;We will be working with those developers to delete the photos from impacted users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Facebook declined to detail the exact apps that may have obtained these photos, or what they may have done with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;The photo mishap could embolden those who believe Facebook and its peers in Silicon Valley should be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/27/trump-administration-is-working-new-proposal-protect-online-privacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regulated for the data they collect about their users&lt;/a&gt;. It could also result in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/08/facebook-could-face-record-fine-say-former-ftc-officials/?utm_term=.7a563611c05b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fines and other penalties&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook, which is already under investigation in the United States for mishandling users' data. That probe, initiated by the Federal Trade Commission, is the result of Facebook’s entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data on 87 million users. A spokesman for the FTC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Rotenberg said the new incident offered “more evidence” that Facebook has run afoul of the 2011 agreement it brokered with the FTC that required the tech giant to improve its privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;“You can call this a bug, or you can call it what it is: yet another instance of Facebook failing to protect its users’ privacy and running afoul of its 2011 consent decree,” Democratic Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1073622426121048064?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;echoed in a tweet Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;In Europe, meanwhile, Facebook could face additional fines under the region’s tough new rules governing data-collection practices. Under the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, companies have to inform policymakers &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;within 72 hours of discovering a breach&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook said Friday it found and fixed the bug on Sept. 22, and it notified regulators in late November after an internal investigation to determine the scope of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Privacy regulators in Ireland -- which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/why-europe-not-congress-will-rein-in-big-tech/2018/04/14/a39c8cd8-2e33-11e8-8dc9-3b51e028b845_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oversee Facebook because of the location of its European headquarters&lt;/a&gt; -- said Friday they had received “a number of breach notifications from Facebook” in recent months. “With reference to these data breaches, including the breach in question, we have this week commenced a statutory inquiry examining Facebook’s compliance with the relevant provisions of the GDPR,” a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley is deeply divided over the issue of bug disclosures. Hackers exploit software bugs and vulnerabilities to steal or gain access to data. But bugs are routinely discovered and patched by tech companies – often without evidence that any data was actually taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Many security experts believe that companies should not have to disclose the mere existence of a bug if there is no evidence that data was compromised. The issue came to a head earlier this year, when reports revealed a security vulnerability in the Google Plus social network. Google came under fire for failing to disclose the bug, but many experts felt that the disclosure should not have been required since there wasn’t clear evidence of stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Several of Facebook’s recent privacy lapses have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/17/a-voter-profiling-firm-hired-by-trump-likely-grabbed-data-for-tens-of-millions-of-facebook-users/?utm_term=.aa5efdc20a01&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;involved third-party apps&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, the firm previously harnessed profile information on Facebook users in 2015 through a quiz app developed by a researcher. In response to that scandal, Facebook initiated a broad review of the games and other third-party apps made available to its users on the site. In May, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/14/facebook-suspends-200-apps-following-cambridge-analytica-scandal/?utm_term=.158e9cca90be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspended about 200 of them&lt;/a&gt;, declining at the time to describe exactly why.&lt;/p&gt;
