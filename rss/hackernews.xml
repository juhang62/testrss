<title>Conversations with a six-year-old on functional programming</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2018/05/06/conversations-with-a-six-year-old-on-functional-programming/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My six-year-old son walked up to me yesterday. “What are you reading?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was reading part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.janis-voigtlaender.eu/papers/TypesForProgrammingAndReasoning.pdf&quot;&gt;Janis Voigtländer’s habilitation thesis&lt;/a&gt;. Unsure where to even start, I decided to just answer straightforwardly: “I’m reading a very long story about free theorems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He persisted. “What are free theorems?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never one to shrink from a pedagogical challenge, I thought for a moment, then began: “Do you know what a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; is?” He didn’t. “A function is like a machine where you put something in one end and something comes out the other end. For example, maybe you put a number in, and the number that is one bigger comes out. So if you put in three, four comes out, or if you put in six, seven comes out.” This clearly made sense to him, so I continued, “The &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of a function machine tells you what kinds of things you put in and what kinds of things come out. So maybe you put a number in and get a number out. Or maybe you put in a &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of numbers and get a number out.” He interrupted excitedly, “Or maybe you could put &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; in??” “Yes, exactly! Maybe you can put words in and get words out. Or maybe there is a function machine where you put &lt;em&gt;other function machines&lt;/em&gt; in and get function machines out!” He gasped in astonishment at the idea of putting function machines into function machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So,” I concluded, “a free theorem is when you can say something that is always true about a function machine if you &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; know its type, but you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; know anything about what it does on the inside.” This seemed a bit beyond him (and to be fair, free theorems are only interesting when polymorphism is involved which I definitely didn’t want to go into). But the whole conversation had given me a different idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, I have a good idea for a game,” I said. “It’s called the function machine game. I will think of a function machine. You tell me things to put into the function machine, and I will tell you what comes out. Then you have to guess what the function machine does.” He immediately liked this game and it has been a huge hit; he wants to play it all the time. We played it while driving to a party yesterday, and we played it this morning while I was in the shower. So far, he has correctly guessed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.%5C%2C+%5Cmin%28x%2B2%2C10%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x.\, \min(x+2,10)&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x.\, \min(x+2,10)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; but that was a bit tough for him. I realized that in some cases he may understand intuitively what the function does but have trouble expressing it in words (this was also a problem with &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.%5C%2C+10+%5Clfloor+x%2F10+%5Crfloor&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x.\, 10 \lfloor x/10 \rfloor&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x.\, 10 \lfloor x/10 \rfloor&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;), so we started using the obvious variant where once the guesser thinks they know what the function does, the players switch roles and the person who came up with function specifies some inputs in order to test whether the guesser is able to produce the correct outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.%5C%2C+6&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x.\, 6&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x.\, 6&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; was also surprisingly difficult for him to guess (though he did get it right eventually). I think he was just stuck on the idea of the function doing something arithmetical to the input, and was having trouble coming up with some sort of arithmetic procedure which would result in &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; title=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; no matter what you put in! It simply hadn’t occurred to him that the machine might &lt;em&gt;not care&lt;/em&gt; about the input. (Interestingly, many students in my functional programming class this semester were also confused by constant functions when we were learning about the lambda calculus; they really wanted to substitute the input &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; and were upset/confused by the fact that the bound variable did not occur in the body at all!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of guessing my functions, he wanted to come up with his own functions for me to guess (as I knew he would). Sometimes his functions are great and sometimes they don’t make sense (usually because his idea of what the function does changes over time, which of course he, in all sincerity, denies), but it’s fun either way. And after he finally understood &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.+%5Cmin%28x%2B2%2C+10%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x. \min(x+2, 10)&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x. \min(x+2, 10)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, he came up with his own function which was something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x%3A%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D.+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+10+-+x+%26+x+%5Cleq+10+%5C%5C+10+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x:\mathbb{N}. \begin{cases} 10 - x &amp;amp; x \leq 10 \\ 10 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x:\mathbb{N}. \begin{cases} 10 - x &amp;amp; x \leq 10 \\ 10 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired, I think, by his kindergarten class where they were learning about pairs of numbers that added up to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; title=&quot;10&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely one of my better parenting days.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Economics of Writing a Technical Book</title>
<link>https://medium.com/p/the-economics-of-writing-a-technical-book-689d0c12fe39</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/p/the-economics-of-writing-a-technical-book-689d0c12fe39</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;141.11337209302&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9a00&quot; id=&quot;9a00&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I am not an expert. I have co-authored a single book in 2017 called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for O’Reilly Media. Many people have asked me what it was like so I will attempt to explain the process, time investment, and financial incentive here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e364&quot; id=&quot;e364&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This was &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; experience. If you have written a book, or would like to, I promise your experience will be different. Nonetheless, I hope you can learn something from the things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;65c3&quot; id=&quot;65c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;327c&quot; id=&quot;327c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The process was about what I expected. I was introduced to Brian, our first of three editors, from someone I knew who was already writing their third book. They thought I might be a good fit for what they were looking for so they made the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*eNnav_Kcf-C_EoLjxARDiQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*eNnav_Kcf-C_EoLjxARDiQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*eNnav_Kcf-C_EoLjxARDiQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;211e&quot; id=&quot;211e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I thought about it for a couple weeks and then submitted a formal book proposal which entailed filling out a Word document template and emailing it to the editor. I didn’t hear back for about 3 weeks and then, after a follow-up email, heard the proposal was approved. After a kick-off call it was suggested that I find a co-author to help write the book. I had a week to find one and then needed to sign a contract with O’Reilly for dates and deliverables. I interviewed a few people and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@transplain&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@transplain&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;158602cec861&quot; data-action-value=&quot;158602cec861&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--p-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kris Nova&lt;/a&gt; and I complemented each others skills perfectly for the content we wanted to cover in the book. She agreed it sounded like a good topic and she was excited to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8bdb&quot; id=&quot;8bdb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The contract seemed fairly standard and focused around content ownership and royalties split. The default split between authors is 50/50 which we stuck with. The contract stipulated that Kris and I own the copyright for the content, but O’Reilly has exclusive rights to use the content any way they see fit throughout the world now and in the future for the duration of the copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d55&quot; id=&quot;4d55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Once the contract was signed there was a steady pace of work as we both figured out how to lay out content and what we should write about. O’Reilly provides a platform called Atlas for writing which is quite good. You write in plain text &lt;a href=&quot;http://asciidoc.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://asciidoc.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/a&gt; and then O’Reilly’s Atlas platform can generate a PDF, or other formats, via the web interface or API. We both used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/odewahn/atlas-cli&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/odewahn/atlas-cli&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;atlas-cli&lt;/a&gt; to generate PDFs as we wrote. Generating the PDFs was a good feedback loop on the content. It helped make sure formatting was right and also allowed us to take a step back to read what we wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f56&quot; id=&quot;5f56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Atlas works as a remote git repo but Kris and I chose to mostly work out of a private GitHub repo. We originally envisioned making pull requests to collaborate on each other's content but that didn’t happen as much as expected. Atlas has editing tools and some additional features available but we mostly just used it as a git remote URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6dc9&quot; id=&quot;6dc9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On March 1st we were assigned our cover animal which Kris and I named Andy O’Connor the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_condor&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_condor&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Andean Condor&lt;/a&gt;. We were pretty excited to see the cover for the first time even if the subtitle went through multiple revisions. We didn’t get to pick the animal or the picture. We were told up front we wouldn’t get to pick the animal so we knew what to expect. We were also told that Tyrannosaurus Rex and unicorns are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*srZXvqZpo2266zkp.png&quot; data-width=&quot;381&quot; data-height=&quot;500&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*srZXvqZpo2266zkp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34ad&quot; id=&quot;34ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We kept writing until the 1/2 draft was due in early June. We turned it in and got less feedback than we expected, but it was still good to have a fresh set of eyes looking at it. We didn’t like what we had created. We had written almost 6 chapters and threw away 3 of them. The first two were heavily edited and the remaining chapter was trimmed down significantly and turned into an appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;542b&quot; id=&quot;542b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We had some more planning meetings and came up with a revised outline that we submitted to our editor for review. By this time we were on our 2nd editor who wasn’t very familiar with the project so we got very little feedback and went with what we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b863&quot; id=&quot;b863&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We kept writing with minimal interactions with our editor until we were really close to needing the full draft due. I had sent select chapters to friends to look at and tried to incorporate the changes they suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c3b0&quot; id=&quot;c3b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The first Tuesday of September the full draft was due and then went into a review process. There were technical reviewers we were able to suggest but mostly O’Reilly pulled from a pool of their trusted reviewers. We got minimal feedback from most of them (a survey form) and one returned notes on the PDF. We had a week to make edits. During this time the draft was made available as a preview on Safari books. In retrospect I wish we had posted preview chapters sooner which was something our first editor suggested, but we were both too embarrassed to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;848e&quot; id=&quot;848e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It wasn’t enough feedback for me so I reached out to more people and sent them chapters looking for someone to tell me it sucks and why. Luckily, I found someone who would give me the harsh feedback I wanted and I had about 3 days to incorporate their changes into the book before it went off to post production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2b9a&quot; id=&quot;2b9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The last push was very difficult and stressful. There were a lot of big changes on the last weekend which was a risk, but I think in the end made the book better. The final weekend we moved some chapters around and wrote a chapter from scratch for content we felt was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f4c&quot; id=&quot;7f4c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Post production was handled by non-technical, professional editors for grammar, spelling, and general readability. I believe the first PDF came back with more than 1300 edits. Overall there were more than 2000 changes made during post. I later found out this amount of edits is fairly standard for our book length. We had about 3 weeks of emailing large, heavily notated PDFs back and forth which was no fun compared to the plain text git workflow of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;35c5&quot; id=&quot;35c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Post production took about a month to complete and then the book went off for printing. At the same time it was posted on Safari Books Online and immediately available. We each received 6 copies of the book in the mail shortly after it was available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36a7&quot; id=&quot;36a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All in all I worked from Feb — Oct for roughly 5 nights a week at 2–3 hours per night. I also worked about 3 weekends non-stop when a draft or final edits were due. Roughly I’d say I worked about 500 hours total. That was only my time and doesn’t include Kris’. I was lucky to have a co-author to share the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d209&quot; id=&quot;d209&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some people have asked how I found motivation to keep writing. I’m a fairly driven individual and the deadlines in the contract were enough for me to put in time most nights. I wasn’t motivated enough to meet the original 250 page goal, but I was happy with the content we were able to cover and how much we accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*065i2j1xvje7kA7iStSH7Q.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1183&quot; data-height=&quot;601&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*065i2j1xvje7kA7iStSH7Q.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*065i2j1xvje7kA7iStSH7Q.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Not a perfect depiction of work done but shows when activity happened
&lt;p name=&quot;8a31&quot; id=&quot;8a31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Kris had a different creative process than I did. She was better at mulling over a topic in her head and putting it all down in one sitting; often the week before one of the deadlines. This made me nervous on multiple occasions and was probably the biggest thing I stressed about. Everything was submitted and completed on time, but I would suggest you have a sense for how you and your co-author work together at the beginning instead of the week before a project deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6650&quot; id=&quot;6650&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Throughout the writing process I felt like I finished writing multiple times. Once when the final draft was due, once when technical reviewer’s feedback was incorporated, and once at the end of the post editing process. In each case it meant we got to take a break from writing while we waited for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4e20&quot; id=&quot;4e20&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At the end of final edits I was done (contractually and mentally). I had read through the entire book at least three times and much of the content was starting to lose meaning. After sending the final edited PDF I wanted to stress about missing an edit before going to bed, but I was too tired to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a290&quot; id=&quot;a290&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Marketing and Affiliate Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f436&quot; id=&quot;f436&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;O’Reilly provides an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cj.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.cj.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;affiliate program&lt;/a&gt; which was terrible to set up and in the end hardly worth the time. You get a cut from all sales that go through your link but I have never received any money from affiliate book sales. The only money I got was when someone used my link and then bought a ticket to an O’Reilly conference. To date only one person has done that and I received $200. If anyone is looking to buy tickets to Velocity or OSCON feel free to click the O’Reilly book links at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info.&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info.&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.cnibook.info&lt;/a&gt; and then buy a conference ticket. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c2fc&quot; id=&quot;c2fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I attempted to set up an affiliate program for Amazon but my application was denied. Amazon offers an author central site to create a 1998 inspired &lt;a href=&quot;https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/profile&quot; data-href=&quot;https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/profile&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;author profile page&lt;/a&gt; and an out of date book sale statistics and rankings. I’m really not sure the point of creating the Amazon author information outside of claiming the book(s) you author and confirming that you have a terrible book rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f760&quot; id=&quot;f760&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While setting up these accounts is when I created the cnibook.info website and @cnibook twitter handle. Luckily the website is a static page hosted on GitHub so there is no recurring costs. The twitter account I still maintain but has minimal interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;15dc&quot; id=&quot;15dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The landing page was a valuable use of my time as it gave a URL to point people to for anyone searching for the book or wanting more information. I would suggest anyone writing a book spend a night to register a domain and set one up. I launched it on August 31, 2017 and it has over 4,600 visits which is terrible by most website standards but good as a place to funnel users for info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8e4e&quot; id=&quot;8e4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;During AWS Re:Invent I decided it would be fun to try a Twitter campaign to try and get some interest in the book. I set a limit of $50 which bought 7,648 impressions (people saw the tweet). This includes 161 engagements (clicked on the tweet, RT’d, or favorited), and 37 clicks (clicked the link). I promoted the tweet above and I don’t think it was worth the money. I don’t believe it generated any sales and cost $.31 per engagement. After that campaign I had another tweet that was retweeted by a friend (I didn’t ask them to do it) with a lot of followers and it had more engagements than the paid for, promoted tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;5654&quot; id=&quot;5654&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Sales and Royalties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bbca&quot; id=&quot;bbca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The book was originally supposed to be 250 pages and would have cost $59.99. Instead it was only 160 pages and cost $39.99. Because we co-authored the book we each got 5% of revenue for physical books and 12.5% for ebooks and digital access (10% and 25% for individual authors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1fff&quot; id=&quot;1fff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This breaks down to we each get $.99 for a physical book and $.46 for an ebook. Safari Books Online (SBO) pays based on how many pages are viewed and how many people have added the book to their personal bookshelf (I never knew before why that was a thing). So far I have received $539 over 5 months for SBO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1121&quot; id=&quot;1121&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The payments come on the last day of the month after the month when O’Reilly receives payment for the sale. If you bought a book on February 1st, $.99 was added to the check I received on March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e410&quot; id=&quot;e410&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From December through March the book has sold &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;1337&lt;/strong&gt; copies. I have no idea how well other books in this category sell. This total also includes 2 book signings at conferences that were sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cncf.io&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cncf.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNCF&lt;/a&gt; (Thank you!) which was roughly 150 physical books total. On average, the book has sold 222 copies per month which is greatly skewed by the first month which had 930 sales. The last month (March) had 34 physical book sales. I suspect that number will go down even more over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;254e&quot; id=&quot;254e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sponsorships was an unexpected source of income. We have been lucky enough to have 3 sponsors so far. The sponsor pays O’Reilly for exclusive rights to provide a PDF and optional print version of the book. The company gets to put a forward in the book that Kris, me, and an O’Reilly editor approve. Once the sponsor completes their contract with O’Reilly they can do whatever they want with the books. Usually, the PDF gets put behind a web form so you fill out your email address and the company uses it for marketing services and getting customer leads. Physical books are usually given away at conferences where they can scan badges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b4c5&quot; id=&quot;b4c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I have no idea if this model is financially viable for the companies but I would assume so. I’ve asked for download numbers but was never provided any and the sponsors are not contractually obligated to give numbers. I’m not sure how many books get sponsors, but it helps a lot with raising awareness of the book because companies have more of a presence on social media and have budgets for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0655&quot; id=&quot;0655&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Each full book sponsorship for one month nets me $3,705 and partial sponsorships give an amount based on percentage of the book sponsored (e.g. 5 chapters in a 10 chapter book is 50% sponsored). That’s much better than I expected because a one month full sponsorship is more than all other sales combined. I’m not going to say exactly what percentage I get from the sponsorship simply because I don’t want to disclose how much any of these 3rd parties pay and their finances are not my business to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3253&quot; id=&quot;3253&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are also some other sponsorships that I think count as ebook sales but I never got a clear answer how royalties work for those. Book licensing incurs a small payment but I’m unclear how that is used. From my statements, three people have licensed the book or excerpts from it which has netted me $2.37.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;039a&quot; id=&quot;039a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My April 2018 statement (sales from December — March) says I’ve made $11,554.15 which roughly breaks down to $23 per hour for the estimated 500 hours of work. Without the three sponsorships that would have been $5.29 per hour. Luckily that number only gets better with time. I’ve heard 2nd editions are a better rate per hour because they have less time investment with similar sales as the original, but I don’t have any experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5314&quot; id=&quot;5314&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Going into this project I had a rough estimate in my head to make about $2000–3000 so this is much better than I expected. Set your expectations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3abb&quot; id=&quot;3abb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba19&quot; id=&quot;ba19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’m extremely happy with the how things have turned out. We’ve got a lot of great feedback and some average reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Applications-Environment/dp/1491984309&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Applications-Environment/dp/1491984309&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (please leave us a review!). I’m grateful that people are reading it and I hope it’s helping them in some way. We worked hard and wanted to help engineers get better at running infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b00e&quot; id=&quot;b00e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I learned that you can’t just write a book and expect it to sell. There needs to be a lot of effort (a.k.a. budget and time) in marketing and it takes more than just individuals with twitter accounts to get the word out. It has been humbling to have friends and organizations help us promote the book and even pay to put the book in people’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a89&quot; id=&quot;4a89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So far I know of only one grammatical mistake, which is a win in my book (pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8d9e&quot; id=&quot;8d9e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The book has provided a few other opportunities that I probably wouldn’t have had. So far I’ve done a couple podcast interviews, spoken at a few events, did one webinar, and have had a few opportunities for more writing projects with O’Reilly (some of which I’ve taken).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3bbf&quot; id=&quot;3bbf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Would I write another book? Not for the foreseeable future. I would like to update &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; to keep it fresh with current industry trends, but another book from scratch is not a year long project I’d be looking forward to at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8d67&quot; id=&quot;8d67&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m very proud of the work we accomplished and glad we wrote it. I can’t think of anything else I would have done with that time that would have been better spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;22c5&quot; id=&quot;22c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’d love it if you bought a copy of the book using the affiliate links at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnibook.info/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnibook.info/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.cnibook.info&lt;/a&gt; and if you’ve already read it please let us know what you think. We’re available on twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rothgar&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rothgar&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rothgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/krisnova&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/krisnova&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;krisnova&lt;/a&gt;. We also love pictures of the book with your pets. It makes us smile. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ff1d&quot; id=&quot;ff1d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I hope this has given you some insights into what it takes to write a book and what you can expect if you do it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter suspended our Open Data project&amp;#039;s account and wiped all our followers</title>
<link>http://www.openbenches.org/blog/2018/05/twitter-suspended-our-account-and-wiped-all-our-followers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.openbenches.org/blog/2018/05/twitter-suspended-our-account-and-wiped-all-our-followers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday evening, I was disturbed to discover that our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches&quot;&gt;OpenBenches Twitter Account&lt;/a&gt; had been suspended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;530&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Well… this is sub-optimal! Twitter have suspended &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@openbenches&lt;/a&gt;. No idea why. No way I can see to appeal. Grrr! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rCkHnMTEOM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rCkHnMTEOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— ꧁Terence Eden꧂ ⏻ (@edent) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edent/status/992803869032927234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, OpenBenches posts photos of benches. That’s it. No porn, no spam, no encouraging malicious behaviour. It’s just pictures like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;530&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;IN LOVING MEMORY OF&lt;br/&gt;BERYL HOOTON&lt;br/&gt;TO WHOM THE GARDEN MEANT SO MUCH&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uIr63hLiQ9&quot;&gt;https://t.co/uIr63hLiQ9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Gzlit7T4jZ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Gzlit7T4jZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— OpenBenches.org (@openbenches) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches/status/992408273973317637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 4, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to appeal the suspension, I quickly got back an automated reply denying the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/suspended.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email from Twitter &amp;quot;Hello, Your account has been suspended due to multiple or repeat violations of the Twitter Rules: https://twitter.com/rules. Please do not respond to this email as replies and new appeals for this account will not be monitored. Thanks, Twitter Support&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;479&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-93&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/suspended.png 454w, http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/suspended-284x300.png 284w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was baffling! The account is connected to a valid email address and working mobile phone number. There were no added apps which could have been used for spamming. Nothing that broke &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rules&quot;&gt;the rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kicked up a bit of a stink on Twitter – and I’m grateful that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/993241321371586566&quot;&gt;so&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dug/status/993118329920421888&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IanYorston/status/993101907337072640&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/billt/status/993097502340648960&quot;&gt;Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PublicChaffinch/status/993091727610253313&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Luehea/status/993067284653662209&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;. I dropped an email to a few people I know at Twitter, but it is a Bank Holiday weekend, so I didn’t expect any of them to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filed &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; appeal the next day, which was also swiftly denied. But, hey, it’s still a long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, without warning, I got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuspended.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello, We've unsuspended your account; sorry for the inconvenience. Please note that it may take an hour or so for your follower and following numbers to return to normal. Twitter has automated systems that find and remove multiple automated spam accounts in bulk. Unfortunately, it looks like your account got caught up in one of these spam groups by mistake. Please do not respond to this email as replies will not be monitored. Thanks, Twitter Support&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuspended.png 454w, http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuspended-201x300.png 201w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve no idea whether a human reviewed it. We were now free from Twitter jail! But it came with a cost. Despite the promises, the followers never returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only had a few hundred, not bad for a parochial project on the psychogeography of memorials, but now we had zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; following us – please follow us again! If you weren’t, now’s a good time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches&quot;&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;! Or, submit a photo of a bench using your mobile phone at &lt;a href=&quot;https://OpenBenches.org&quot;&gt;https://OpenBenches.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know. We should redecentralize and put our content on Mastodon, or the BlockChain, or some other convoluted platform which has no users. But that’s just not practical for a small project. We have limited technical resources and have to go to where the people are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a website, and lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edent/openbenches/#open-data-api&quot;&gt;Open Data&lt;/a&gt; – if you want to help syndicate us to multiple platforms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edent/openbenches/&quot;&gt;please file a pull request&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Concorde ‘B’</title>
<link>https://www.heritageconcorde.com/concorde-b</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.heritageconcorde.com/concorde-b</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;i2kygjx6&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Some of the details on this page are thanks to Gordon Roxburgh of Concordesst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyk47c&quot; readability=&quot;50&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The Concorde production sadly ended with airframe number 216 (G-BOAF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This is particularly frustrating as the Concorde ‘B’ model was already designed and the engines were available for incorporation into the next airframe number 217.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This was the aircraft the airlines really needed and the aircraft the manufacturers wanted to build. Unfortunately political pressure intervened and the will to proceed with it simply evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The new engine (the Olympus 610 +25%) had, as its name suggests, more thrust and eliminated noisy, fuel-guzzling afterburners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The wing was redesigned, had leading edge ‘droop’ and carried more fuel. With better lift/drag, specific fuel consumption and more fuel the range of the Concorde Model ‘B’ increased over the original Concorde ‘A’ Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kylena&quot; readability=&quot;166&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Just four months after Concorde began her scheduled services in 1976, a Concorde ‘B’ model was first discussed and designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.This would have given 500 mi (805 km) additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;During 1976 Jacques Mitterrand, the Chairman and Managing Director of Aerospatiale, submitted a proposal to investigate an improved version of Concorde – the “Version B” to Mr. Cavaille, French Secretary of State to Transport a similar letter was submitted to the British government at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The letter that he sent elaborated on the quality of the work which had been carried out and the know-how that had now been acquired by the four French and British engineering companies (Aerospatiale, BAe, Rolls Royce and SNECMA). In this letter he also stressed the importance of the role that the manufacturers of Concorde could have in the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft, that would be foreseeable during the 1990’s, could lead to probably in some form of a collaboration between Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;An exploratory study was actually already underway during this time, looking into upgrading the capabilities of the current Concorde design for the early 1980’s. The letter submitted also gave the official go ahead for this exploratory study and proposed a full feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Due to the manufactures having great difficulty selling the remaining five Concorde airframes that were built during the initial production run, Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) was to be the last Concorde ‘A’ built, and 217 was planned to be a Concorde ‘B’ version. Had Concorde ‘B’ been built, what type of future would we be living in now? If the additional range and performance had been available then many more airlines might have purchased Concorde and passenger air travel as we know it today might have been completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;She was planned to have a range approaching and even exceeding 5000 miles. But it is easy to imagine the potential range of Concorde ‘B’ design, when you consider that the Concorde “A” model used by British Airways had a design specification range of 3690 miles, had to regularly fly 4250 miles on a route between London Heathrow and Barbados. This was made possible due to operational improvements that pushed the range of Concorde ‘A’ to nearly 4500 miles. The improvements have included small changes to the aerodynamics of the original model’s specifications. One interesting fact is that the take-off weight was made very low and close to the figures estimated for the Concorde ‘B’ design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The Concorde ‘B’ design would of also benefited from increased subsonic performance and reduced noise emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The cost of the Concorde Project was massive and with the poor sales of Concorde, and cancelled options from airlines, adding to that the rising cost of aviation fuel during the 1970s, the development of the Model ‘B’ version was considered too expensive and cancelled. Although the study carried out was a pretty comprehensive one and could of given Concorde a real future in during the years to come right into the 1990s and even on into the 2000s, after this time it was generally expected that a new generation SST with a new type of variable cycle engines would enter into service (BAe AST3 or Aerospatiale Alliance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Exploratory and feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The study into a Concorde ‘B’ design had two aims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;1. To ensure the expansion and future demand for supersonic transport (SST), where the Anglo-French group was now and into the future as the main and only player,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;2. To maintain the high knowledge level gained by the manufacturers in Britain and France, and to provide a solid position for the participation in a future program of a second-generation SST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This feasibility study, was planned to last 9 months and was estimated to cost 9 million French francs, it was to comprise three areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;1. Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;2. Development costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;3. Markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;If this exploratory and feasibility study was to confirmed an economic interest for the manufacturers, and then led to the decision of the launch of an improved version of Concorde, such an improved version (allowing for a 5 year development programme) could be ready by spring 1982 for the 17th production Concorde 217&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Civil aviation history shows that almost all new aircraft constituted a base point for the start of improved versions (The Boeing 747-100 evolved into today’s 747-400) and at this stage this was the plan for the Concorde program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The interest in this development process would have been beneficial to both the airlines and the manufacturers of Concorde:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;1. For the airlines, it would have offered performance improvements (lower direct operation costs, extension of the operating range, and reduction of environmental effects) while conserving the existing investments in crew training, maintenance procedures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;2. For the manufacturers, it would have made it possible to carry out these improvements at a minimum capital cost. Indeed the development of the initial production version generally revealed aerodynamic areas where gains could be made along with structural margins, but these could not be exploited due to the time constraints in getting Concorde into passenger service successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;3. If the decision to build the B model would have been taken, the modifications would have been relatively inexpensive as they were just some minor changes to the existing production process, allowing the majority of the tooling to be maintained. The high level of knowledge that was gained during the certification of the current model would have greatly reduced time and costs during the certification of the B model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;These considerations should have applied particularly to the case of Concorde, considering the exceptional degree of innovation obtained and the great amount of technical knowledge accumulated during the twelve years of development of the initial production version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The broad objectives of the Concorde ‘B’ version were to ensure the expansion of the network of routes that supersonic aircraft could use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The following improvements were considered to be necessary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;The Reduction of  harmful acoustic effects on the airport environment:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Although the level of noise produced by Concorde at takeoff and landing is equivalent to that of the first generation long haul aircraft in service (B 707, DC8), only the second generation of long haul aircraft (B747, DC10, L1011) equipped with high-bypass jet engines satisfied the new international noise rules. With the reaction of the United States, which had at the start of scheduled Concorde services not accepted the use of Concorde on their territory, it would be important to reduce the level of noise generated by the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyqbdu&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The operating range of the initial version – primarily designed for the connection Paris London-New York – was to be increased to allow connections of the type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other European capital cities – East Coast of the US in one sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United States – Japan in two sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Europe – Australia in three sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyr86u&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Fuel consumption reductions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Concorde’s fuel consumption accounts for a third of the direct operating cost (DOC). A reduction in fuel consumption would mean an improvement in economics for the airlines using the aircraft, making it even more marketable by the manufacturers, and also enable the airlines to reduce ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Airframe aerodynamic improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyrwsf&quot; readability=&quot;46&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The objective of noise reduction implies an increase in the smoothness of flight during takeoff and landing, which also results in an improvement in all subsonic flight modes (climb, subsonic cruise, approach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This would also help in the above objective of increasing the operating range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This modification must respect two constraints: to preserve – if not improve – the supersonic smoothness of flight, and to limit the effects from modifications or additions on the central core structure of the wing, in order to re-use the majority of the tooling currently used in manufacture and assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyts68&quot; readability=&quot;52&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;A moderate increase in the range could be obtained by aerodynamic tweaks to the current design. These included lengthening the wing tips and mounting droop slats on the leading edges of the wings. These tweaks would reduce the induced drag at supersonic speeds and increase the available lift at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The additional lift generated by the leading edge droops would permit the aircraft the fly at a lower angle of attack at slower speeds, therefore requiring less power to be generated by the powerplant, which in turn would reduce noise and increase fuel efficiency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Optimisation of twist and camber of the wing, combined with the increase in the lift coefficient (Cz) along with the increased thrust offered by the supersonic engine also allows improvements of the smoothness of flight at Mach 2.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Detailed aerodynamic improvements, (reshaped trailing edge of the control surfaces and thinning of the lower lips of air intake) which were later applied to the current production models before they entered service, were also proposed to be continued on the Concorde ’B’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Modifications of the powerplant unit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyufal&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The majority of the noise produced by Concorde during  takeoff and landing comes from the areas of strong aerodynamic shearing, which are located at the edge of the exhaust system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The powerplant, which is optimised for supersonic cruise rather than subsonic flight would be modified so that gains could be made throughout the whole speed range during flight, and Specific gains could then be made in the fuel consumption in the transonic region, thus then giving an increase in the operating range required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyvxpc&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Physically, the modifications would consist of replacing the low-pressure compressor with a compressor with a increased diameter, and the low pressure turbine assembly with a two-stage turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Then the installation of a discharge system to increase the margin of air flow through the engine would result in an increase in air flow which reaches 25 % on takeoff and 35 % during approach. The thrust gains obtained at takeoff and at transonic speeds could also make it possible to remove the reheat (afterburner) system with its very heavy fuel consumption and significant addition to the noise generated by the powerplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Fuel tanks modifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyxcrr&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The increase of capacity obtained by the enlarging of the external wing and the tank at the front of the wing could be supplemented by the addition of a fuselage tank connected to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The maximum quantity of fuel that can be put on board increases from 95,254 kg to 99,790 kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyya26&quot; readability=&quot;47&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Modifications of aircraft systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Changes would have been incorporated in the autopilot system for the takeoff and approach stages, in order to automatically optimise the aircraft in these key stages of flight and to reduce the noise levels around the airports during takeoff and landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Airframe weight and performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The additional wing area along with the modifications to the engines and intakes would add to the empty weight of the aircraft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The reductions would have been obtained mainly by the use of carbon fibre in the construction of control surfaces, service doors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The increase in the empty weight and the fuel carrying capability also requires an increase in the various performance characteristics (a payload of 24,800lbs/11260kg is used).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Core Erlang by Example</title>
<link>http://blog.erlang.org/core-erlang-by-example/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.erlang.org/core-erlang-by-example/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;May 07, 2018 · by Björn Gustavsson .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;108.13792690234&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is the first about the Core Erlang format. In this blog post, we introduce the Core Erlang format through examples that compare Erlang code to the corresponding Core Erlang code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the following command to translate my example module to Core Erlang code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ erlc +time +to_core core_example.erl

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.erlang.org/compiler-lost-in-translation/&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; explored the passes from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parse_module&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expand_records&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; passes translates from the abstract code to Core Erlang. We will talk more about the Core Erlang passes in future blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have slightly edited the examples to make them somewhat easier to read. There will be an unedited example at the very end of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to cover, so let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-simplest-function&quot;&gt;The simplest function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let start with the simplest possible function, a function with no arguments returning an atom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;simplest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;'ok'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang, that will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'simplest'/0 =
    fun () -&amp;gt;
        'ok'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that example, we can work out the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;slightly-less-simple&quot;&gt;Slightly less simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is as slightly more complicated function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'id'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        _@c0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: All examples were compiled with OTP 20. The name of the generated variables will be different in the upcoming OTP 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, variables are named as in Erlang. In the translation to Core Erlang, the compiler generates new variable names for the arguments in a function head. The following code is also valid Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'id'/1 =
    fun (I) -&amp;gt;
        I
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-one-clause&quot;&gt;More than one clause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a function with more than one clause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(_)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'a'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c2&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'error'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; can only have a single clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern matching must be done in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;, not in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guards are mandatory for each clause in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a valid variable name in Core Erlang. Uninteresting values must be bound to a new variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; around the patterns will be explained soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Erlang, multiple function clauses can also be written with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Core Erlang code will be essentially the same as the Core Erlang code for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a/1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'b'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c3&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'error'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-clauses-three-arguments&quot;&gt;Two clauses, three arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try multiple arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(_,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;_)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'c'/3 =
    fun (_@c2,_@c1,_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case &amp;lt;_@c2,_@c1,_@c0&amp;gt; of
          &amp;lt;'inc',Base,N&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              call 'erlang':'+'(Base, N)
          &amp;lt;_@c6,Base,_@c7&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              Base
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; denote a &lt;strong&gt;value list&lt;/strong&gt;. The patterns in each clause in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; are always part of a value list. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expression is a value list unless there is only one expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operators such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; are not part of the Core Erlang language, so the compiler has translated the use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; to a call to the BIF &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;erlang:'+'/2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;if&quot;&gt;If&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; is implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;greater&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;not_greater&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'d'/2 =
    fun (_@c1,_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case &amp;lt;&amp;gt; of
          &amp;lt;&amp;gt; when call 'erlang':'&amp;gt;'(_@c1, _@c0) -&amp;gt;
              'greater'
          &amp;lt;&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'not_greater'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expression and the patterns are each value lists with zero elements. All the action is in the guards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;repeated-variables&quot;&gt;Repeated variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Erlang, a variable can be repeated in a clause or within a pattern to indicate that the values must be the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(_,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;_)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;different&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Erlang does not allow repeating a variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'cmp'/2 =
    fun (_@c1,_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case &amp;lt;_@c1,_@c0&amp;gt; of
          &amp;lt;Same,_@c4&amp;gt; when call 'erlang':'=:='(_@c4, Same) -&amp;gt;
              'same'
          &amp;lt;_@c5,_@c6&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'different'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here the second occurence of the variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/code&gt; has been renamed to a new variable named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_@c4&lt;/code&gt;, and a guard has been added to compare &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_@c4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;exceptions&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function will fail with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;function_clause&lt;/code&gt; exception if it is called with any other value than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'e'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              primop 'match_fail'({'function_clause',_@c1})
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; in Core Erlang must not fall off at the end, that is, there must always be a clause that will match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the last clause with a variable pattern and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; guard is guaranteed to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body for the last clause calls a &lt;strong&gt;primop&lt;/strong&gt; to generate a function clause exception. Primops are primitive operations provided by the Erlang implementation, but not specified in the Core Erlang language specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a similar function excepts that is uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; and therefore will generate a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case_clause&lt;/code&gt; exception if called with any other argument than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Core Erlang code is similar to the code for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e/1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'f'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              primop 'match_fail'({'case_clause',_@c1})
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only difference is the argument for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;match_fail&lt;/code&gt; primop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewrite this function one more time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'g'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              primop 'match_fail'({'badmatch',_@c1})
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Again, the only difference is the argument for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;match_fail&lt;/code&gt; primop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;binding-variables-using-let&quot;&gt;Binding variables using ‘let’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a function that binds the variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'h'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        let &amp;lt;I&amp;gt; =
              apply 'id'/1(_@c0)
        in
              call 'erlang':'+'(I, _@c0)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; calls a fun or local function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return value of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; is bound to the variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; can only be used in the code that follows the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variable name is in a value list. That is because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; can bind several variables at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;binding-more-than-one-variable-in-a-let&quot;&gt;Binding more than one variable in a ‘let’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang has essentially no scoping. When a variable has been bound, it remains bound to the end of the function. For example, variables bound in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; can be used after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'i'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        let &amp;lt;_@c7,X,Y&amp;gt; =
            case _@c0 of
              &amp;lt;'a'&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;10,1,10&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;'b'&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;17,23,17&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;_@c5&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                  primop 'match_fail'({'case_clause',_@c5})
            end
        in
            {X,Y}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; in Core Erlang does not export any variables. All variables that are to be used after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; must be explicitly returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the first two clauses of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; return a value list with &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; values. The first value is the return value of the case, which in this case is ignored. The other two values are the values assigned to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; variables, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The values returned from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; is bound in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;. The ignored return value is bound to a new variable (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_@c7&lt;/code&gt;), which is never used. The exported values are bound to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-unedited-core-erlang-code&quot;&gt;The unedited Core Erlang code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far all Core Erlang examples have been edited to make the points I am trying to make stand out clearer. Let’s have a look at the unedited version of a previous example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'e'/1 =
    %% Line 33
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          ( &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                ( primop 'match_fail'
                      ({'function_clause',_@c1})
                  -| [{'function_name',{'e',1}}] )
            -| ['compiler_generated'] )
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-|&lt;/code&gt; associates an annotation with a Core Erlang construct. The meaning of an annotation is not specified in the Core Erlang language specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compiler_generated&lt;/code&gt; annotation associated with the last clause is a hint added by the compiler that subsequent optimization passes should not generate a warning if the clause was found to never match and dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment “Line 33” at the beginning is actually an annotation that the pretty printer has turned into a comment to avoid rendering the pretty-printed code unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Erlang is less complicated than Erlang, and is therefore more suited than the abstract format for code analyzing tools (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://erlang.org/doc/apps/dialyzer/dialyzer_chapter.html&quot;&gt;Dialyzer&lt;/a&gt;) and optimizers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>12-year study will look at effects of universal basic income</title>

<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;sub-head&quot;&gt;$25 million will be given to participants, with no strings attached.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pubdate&quot;&gt;By Rebecca Linke  |  January 30, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;imagecallout&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mitsloan.mit.edu/uploadedImagesV9/Global/Articles_and_Press_Releases/Newsroom_-_Articles/universal-basic-income.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;universal-basic-income&quot;/&gt; GiveDirectly will be transferring money to 21,000 Kenyans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout whyitmatters&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a universal basic income is not new, but the theory has never been thoroughly tested. A massive new study is about to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next 12 years, MIT Sloan associate professor Tavneet Suri will be part of a team collaborating with the nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; to study the effects of implementing a universal basic income in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suri is conducting the research along with MIT professor Abhijit Banerjee, Princeton professor Alan Krueger, University of California San Diego professor Paul Niehaus, and GiveDirectly president Michael Faye. Overall, GiveDirectly expects to transfer $25 million to more than 21,000 people (not including the control group), 5,000 of whom will receive cash transfers for 12 years. The money comes with no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study will be divided into four groups: one will receive the equivalent of 75 cents a day per person for 12 years; one will receive the 75 cents a day per person for two years; one will receive the same amount of money (in net present value) as the two-year group in an up-front lump sum; and a fourth group will act as a control group, receiving nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who advocate for a universal basic income say it will be a way to pull people out of poverty. Skeptics think a universal basic income will act as a disincentive for people to work. “It is easy to have opinions without evidence,” Suri said. “It is time we tried to gather some evidence and started thinking about what the impacts truly are and how it changes people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope the study answers several questions. How will having a guaranteed income affect wealth, security, how people use their time, employment levels, efforts to find work, childcare health outcomes, and women’s empowerment? Will more people pursue educational opportunities? Will there be any mental health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another main goal of the study, aside from helping alleviate poverty, is to have solid information to provide to policymakers. “If we want policymakers to do this, we can point to the benefits of the different arms of the study and say, ‘Here is the menu. You choose,’” Suri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrollment for the study started in November 2017 and will likely be completed by the end of April. About 10 percent of recipients have begun receiving cash transfers already. GiveDirectly expects all participants will be receiving money by May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other basic income experiments, including one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-11/what-if-everyone-got-a-monthly-check-from-the-government&quot;&gt;giving money to 2,000 people in Finland&lt;/a&gt;, are ongoing, but the GiveDirectly study is by far the largest and longest, which Suri says will allow her team to gather more data, discerning more overall effects and potentially smaller effects than is possible with smaller studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will continue to produce results while the study is ongoing, with the first follow-up scheduled for next year. “I expect we will have a stream of results,” Suri said. “If it is really going to change the villages in the long-term like we expect, you want to watch that as it happens. Are there any big changes? If there are, we will be watching from the sidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Surviving Your 40s</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/opinion/sunday/how-to-survive-your-40s.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/opinion/sunday/how-to-survive-your-40s.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-19pn8re e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I agree. We’ve actually managed to learn and grow a bit. We see the hidden costs of things. Our parents have stopped trying to change us. We can tell when something is ridiculous. And other minds are finally less opaque. The seminal journey of the 40s is from “everyone hates me” to “they don’t really care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-19pn8re e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even so, the decade is confusing. We can finally decode interpersonal dynamics, but we can’t remember a two-digit number. We’re at or approaching our lifetime peak in earnings, but Botox now seems like a reasonable idea. We’re reaching the height of our careers, but we can now see how they will probably end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-19pn8re e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And this new age is strangely lacking in milestones. Childhood and adolescence are nothing but milestones: You grow taller, advance to new grades, and get your period, your driver’s license and your diploma. Then in your 20s and 30s you romance potential partners, find jobs and learn to support yourself. There may be promotions, babies and weddings. The pings of adrenaline from all these carry you forward and reassure you that you’re building an adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-19pn8re e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the 40s, we might still acquire degrees, jobs, homes and spouses, but these elicit less wonder now. The mentors and parents who used to rejoice in our achievements are preoccupied with their own declines. If we have kids, we’re supposed to marvel at &lt;em class=&quot;css-mfdtsm ehxkw330&quot;&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; milestones. A journalist I know lamented that he’d never again be a prodigy at anything. (Someone younger than both of us had just been nominated to the United States Supreme Court.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-19pn8re e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Even five years ago, people I met would be like, ‘Wow, you’re the boss?’” the 44-year-old head of a TV production company tells me. Now they’re matter-of-fact about his title. “I’ve aged out of wunderkind,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-19pn8re e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;What have we aged into? We’re still capable of action, change and 10K races. But there’s a new immediacy to the 40s — and an awareness of death — that didn’t exist before. Our possibilities feel more finite. All choices now plainly exclude others. It’s pointless to keep pretending to be what we’re not. At 40, we’re no longer preparing for an imagined future life. Our real lives are, indisputably, happening right now. We’ve arrived at what Immanuel Kant called the “Ding an sich” — the thing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-19pn8re e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Indeed, the strangest part of the 40s is that we’re now the ones attending parent-teacher conferences and cooking the turkey on Thanksgiving. These days, when I think, “Someone should really do something about that,” I realize with alarm that that “someone” is me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reinforcement Learning – Bandit Problems</title>
<link>https://oneraynyday.github.io/ml/2018/05/03/Reinforcement-Learning-Bandit/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://oneraynyday.github.io/ml/2018/05/03/Reinforcement-Learning-Bandit/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;To begin, we should note that &lt;strong&gt;bandit problems&lt;/strong&gt; are a subset of &lt;strong&gt;tabular solution methods&lt;/strong&gt;. The reason it’s called tabular is because we can fit all the possible states into a table. The tables tell us everything we need to know about the state of the problem, and so we can often find the exact solution to the problem that’s posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One-armed bandit&lt;/em&gt;: a slot machine operated by pulling a long handle at the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are faced with $k$ different actions. Each action gives you an amount of money, sampled from a distribution conditioned on the action. Each time step, you pick an action. You usually end with $T$ time steps. &lt;strong&gt;How do you maximize your gain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time step $t$, we have an action, $A_t$, and a reward of the action, $R_t$. We denote the &lt;strong&gt;value* of an arbitrary action $a$&lt;/strong&gt; as $q_*(a)$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean in english? It means “the value of an action $a$ is the expected value of the reward of that action(at any time).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading that sentence 3-4 times, it makes sense right? If you knew that doing 1 action will give you the greatest expected value, then you abuse the hell out of it to max your gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we obviously want $q_*(a)$. It’s hard to get, though. $Q_t(a)$ is an estimate of $q_*(a)$ at time $t$. A desirable property is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we make the $Q_t(a)$?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;value*&lt;/em&gt;: in this case, it’s different than the concept of rewards. Value is the long run metric, meanwhile reward is the immediate metric. If you got hooked on heroin, it would be awesome rewards for the first hour, but it would be terrible value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have to estimate the action values, and then, we will decide what actions to do once we have estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;estimating-action-values&quot;&gt;Estimating Action Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One easy way to approximate $q_*(a)$ is to use &lt;strong&gt;sample means&lt;/strong&gt;. What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might look loaded but really it’s just saying “for all the times we chose the action $a$, what was the average reward?” And this approximation of $q_*(a)$ is pretty good! Why? Because the expression above is literally SLLN(Strong Law of Large Numbers) in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that entail? It entails that $Q_t(a)$ converges almost surely to $q_*(a)$, or more formally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is stronger than a convergence in probability(which is already enough for most applications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is great, asymptotically speaking we will definitely reach $q_*(a)$… right? (Not really, we will see why later)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;action-selection-rule--greedy&quot;&gt;Action Selection Rule : Greedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest and probably one of the worst thing you can do is to get addicted to heroin. That’s taking the greediest action, the one that gives you the greatest perceived value so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take whatever action has the greatest value so far. If we start as a blank slate, we’ll just keep taking the best value movement without exploring at all our other choices. This will easily lead to a suboptimal solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;action-selection-rule--epsilon-greedy&quot;&gt;Action Selection Rule : $\epsilon$-Greedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could we do as an alternative? We can try something called an &lt;strong&gt;$\epsilon$-greedy method&lt;/strong&gt;. This just means, for some small probability $\epsilon &amp;lt; 1$ at any time $t$, we choose from all actions uniformly. Asymptotically speaking, we will take the actual optimal action with probability of more than $1-\epsilon$(once we found it, we’ll make sure to choose it all the time, but we also have $\frac{1}{\vert S\vert} * \epsilon$ chance to pick it in case of the uniform action choices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;crux-nonstationary-action-value&quot;&gt;Crux: Nonstationary Action Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time, our action values are changing with time. This is bad, because $q_*(a)$ is now dependent on time, so it’s more like $q_*(a,t)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, we had(we simplify the notation here):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be expressed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a very familiar update rule! Look like sgd by any chance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this has the property of converging with probability 1 to $q_*(a)$ if it’s stationary. Now, what if it’s not? We definitely don’t want equal weighting of $R_0$ as $R_{n-1}$, because our most recent rewards reflect the current action values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can replace $\frac{1}{n}$ and replace it with $\alpha \in (0, 1]$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;strong&gt;exponential average&lt;/strong&gt;, which geometrically decays the weight of previous rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s abstract it even more: we introduce a function $\alpha_n(a)$ which gives us the weight of a specific reward at time step $n$ (in this case since we’re only concerned about an action, replace $\alpha_n(a)$ with $\alpha_n$):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need some properties about $\alpha_n(a)$ for this update to be arbitrarily convergent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-transience&quot;&gt;1. Transience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implies that for any starting value $Q_1 \in \Re$, we can reach any arbitrary $q_*(a) \in \Re$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-convergence&quot;&gt;2. Convergence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implies that the steps will be “small enough to assure convergence to a finite number”. I tried searching for a proof for #2, but it seemed like it required too much &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/math/ucb/text/math_s3_v1_article-04.pdf&quot;&gt;machinery&lt;/a&gt;. Like, 6 pages of machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why did we decide to set $\alpha_n(a) = \alpha \in (0,1]$? Isn’t that a constant? Wouldn’t we lose our guarrantees for convergence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, we do. But it’s with good reason. We don’t want to converge to a specific value. The optimal action-value is nonstationary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;action-selection-rule-optimistic-initial-values&quot;&gt;Action Selection Rule: Optimistic Initial Values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we had to set initial values $Q_1(a)$ pretty arbitrarily. This is essentially a set of &lt;strong&gt;hyperparameters&lt;/strong&gt; for initialization. One trick is to set the initial values for $Q_1(a) = C \forall a$, where $C &amp;gt; q_*(a) \forall a$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, the learner’s estimate of $Q_n(a)$ will be decreasing at first, prioritizing exploration of all the states. Once the $Q_n(a)$’s have become close to $q_*(a)$, then greedy selection takes over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One con is that this is &lt;em&gt;not good for nonstationary problems&lt;/em&gt;. We are, in a way, doing simulated annealing and with enough time, we’re going to converge. We don’t want that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;action-selection-rule-upper-confidence-bound-selection&quot;&gt;Action Selection Rule: Upper-Confidence-Bound Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://oneraynyday.github.io/ml/2017/08/08/Bias-Variance-Tradeoff/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? I wrote this blog a while ago about bias variance tradeoff, with this as the holy grail result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick recap of this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;$R(f)$ is the (theoretical)risk of a hypothesis $f$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$R(f*)$ is the minimum risk of a hypothesis $f$ in the space of hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$M$ is the size of our hypothesis set, $\vert \mathcal{H} \vert$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$N$ is the number of samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\delta$ is a constant. (If you have to know, it’s roughly the probability that a the hypothesis that we choose is bad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this is saying most importantly, is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;At very low number of samples, our bound is very loose. We don’t know whether our current hypothesis is the best hypothesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bigger our hypothesis set, the more loose our bound is for PAC learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this transfers over to the reinforcement learning domain as well, in the form of &lt;strong&gt;Upper-Confidence-Bound action selection&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t this look familiar to the equality above? In here, some notations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;$N_t(a)$ is the number of times action $a$ has been selected for the $t$ time intervals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$c$ is some constant we choose to control degree of exploration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same analog, we can say that $t$ is the hypothesis space size $M$ from our previous equation. This is because as we increase on $t$, the sequence of actions $(a_n)$ up to $t$ grows in space. It is thus harder to select an $A_t$. However, as the amount of times we’ve selected $a$, $N_t(a)$ increases, we also gain information about how this action behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gradient-bandit-algorithms&quot;&gt;Gradient Bandit Algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been estimating $q_*(a)$, but what if I said there’s a different interpretation? How about we learn a &lt;strong&gt;preference&lt;/strong&gt; for an action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll call the preference for the action $H_t(a)$. It’s not related to the reward at all, as we’ll see. We model $A_t$ as a gibbs distribution(in machine learning land, researchers call this the softmax distribution):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re in business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we perform gradient-based MLE? So we do gradient ascent with respect to $H_t(a)$ because that’s what our variable is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to &lt;strong&gt;maximize&lt;/strong&gt; $E(R_t)$. Recall that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we have this, our general format for updates should be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… for gradient ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s differentiate our gibbs distribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only one partial derivative of the whole gradient. What about the actions $b$ where $b \neq a$? I don’t really want to write out the $\LaTeX$ again, so here’s the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can thus observe a generalization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now we can plug that into the equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we do some &lt;strong&gt;black magic&lt;/strong&gt;. This is legal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this true? Simply because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll introduce one more weird addition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because now, $q_*(a,t)$ is inside expectations of $a$, total expectations states that we can replace it with $R_t$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing is what do we choose for $X_t$? What is $X_t$? Well frankly, $X_t$ can be anything you want, but one can set this to the sampled average of previous rewards, $\bar{R}_t$, because then we would have an interpretable gradient. You don’t really need this to run the algorithm successfully, but this is chosen for stability, interpretability and historical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all ready to see our new update rule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $a$ is the action taken at time $t$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, finding the expectation is hard, so we do a stochastic update and drop the expectations to get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple way to choose the action is to pick $argmax_a \pi_t(a)$. So we’re done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a plot of how these algorithms do compared to each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://oneraynyday.github.io/assets/bandit_algos.png&quot; alt=&quot;comparison&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some of these methods are considered simple, it is not at all poorly performing. In fact, these are &lt;em&gt;state of the art&lt;/em&gt; methods for many of reinforcement learning problems, and some of the ones we’ll learn later will be more complicated, more powerful, but more brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
