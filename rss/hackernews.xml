&lt;p&gt;Facebook has long said that it doesn’t use location data to make friend suggestions, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t thought about using it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Facebook filed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;S1=%2820160114.PD.+AND+%28Facebook.AS.+OR+Facebook.AANM.%29%29&amp;amp;OS=PD/1/14/2016+and+%28AN/Facebook+or+AANM/Facebook%29&amp;amp;RS=%28PD/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;S1=%2820160114.PD.+AND+%28Facebook.AS.+OR+Facebook.AANM.%29%29&amp;amp;OS=PD/1/14/2016+and+%28AN/Facebook+or+AANM/Facebook%29&amp;amp;RS=%28PD/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; application for a technique that employs smartphone data to figure out if two people might know each other. The author, an engineering manager at Facebook named Ben Chen, wrote that it was not merely possible to detect that two smartphones were in the same place at the same time, but that by comparing the accelerometer and gyroscope readings of each phone, the data could identify when people were facing each other or walking together. That way, Facebook could suggest you friend the person you were talking to at a bar last night, and not all the other people there that you chose &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook says it hasn’t put this technique into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not currently using location [for People You May Know],” said a Facebook spokesperson. Facebook has previously told us that it only used location for friend recommendations one time during a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fusion.net/story/319981/facebook-location-test-friend-suggestions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'http://fusion.net/story/319981/facebook-location-test-friend-suggestions/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;brief test in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. But several of its patents show it thinking about using location, also recommending users friend each other, for example, if they “&lt;a href=&quot;http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20140114774.PGNR.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20140114774.PGNR.', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;check into the social network from the same location at around the same time&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of our year-long investigation into how the social network makes its uncannily accurate friend recommendations to users, Facebook has told us many things it doesn’t do, to ease fears about Facebook’s ability to spy on its users: It doesn’t use proxies for location, such as wi-fi networks or IP addresses. It doesn’t use profile views &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-wont-use-all-powerful-face-recognition-to-sugg-1821430604&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-wont-use-all-powerful-face-recognition-to-sugg-1821430604', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;or face recognition&lt;/a&gt; or who you text with on WhatsApp. Most of Facebook’s uncanny guesswork is the result of a healthy percentage of users &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;simply handing over their address books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean Facebook hasn’t &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; about employing users’ metadata more strategically to make connections between them. Patents filed by Facebook that mention People You May Know show some ingenious methods that Facebook has devised for figuring out that seeming strangers on the network might know each other. One &lt;a href=&quot;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;amp;Query=PN/9485423&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;amp;Query=PN/9485423', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;filed in 2015&lt;/a&gt; describes a technique that would connect two people through the camera metadata associated with the photos they uploaded. It might assume two people knew each other if the images they uploaded looked like they were titled in the same series of photos—IMG_4605739.jpg and IMG_4605742, for example—or if lens scratches or dust were detectable in the same spots on the photos, revealing the photos were taken by the same camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would result in all the people you’ve sent photos to, who then uploaded them to Facebook, showing up in one another’s “People You May Know.” It’d be a great way to meet the other people who hired your wedding photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re also not analyzing images taken by the same camera to make recommendations in People You May Know,” said a Facebook spokesperson when asked about the patent. “We’ve often sought patents for technology we never implement, and patents should not be taken as an indication of future plans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technological analysis in some of the patents is pretty astounding, but it could well be wishful thinking on Facebook’s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vera Ranieri, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who focuses on intellectual property, hasn’t reviewed these specific patents but said generally that the U.S. Patent Office doesn’t ensure that a technology actually works before granting a patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of patents are filed at the idea stage rather than the actuality stage,” said Ranieri by phone. “A tech company that files a patent has, hopefully, at least thought about how to do it. You’d hope they could implement it if asked, but it doesn’t mean they have done so before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since being born into the world in 2004, Facebook has filed for thousands of technology patents in order to lock down its intellectual property and, like many in the field, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/technology/patent-wars-among-tech-giants-can-stifle-competition.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/technology/patent-wars-among-tech-giants-can-stifle-competition.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;stifle competition&lt;/a&gt;. In a search of those patents, we found a dozen, filed from 2010 to 2016, that were directly relevant to People You May Know, or PYMK as it’s called internally. They include techniques that Facebook could use one day to make friend suggestions—or techniques it could sue someone else for using.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken in their breadth, they speak to the many sources of information Facebook could tap to learn more about us and our real-world social networks, thanks in large part to the sophisticated surveillance tools built by default into our smartphones, such as accelerometers, gyrometers, microphones, cameras, and endless, sprawling contact books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook employees and contractors who authored the patents repeatedly explain why People You May Know is so crucial to the network: People with more friends use the network more and look at more ads. Without People You May Know, the $500 billion behemoth that is Facebook would be making less money. That may be why users aren’t allowed to opt out of the feature, even when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-outs-sex-workers-1818861596&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-outs-sex-workers-1818861596', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;carries risks for them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For people with low friends counts—usually new to Facebook—we’ve heard that the suggestions we provide help them feel more engaged, and we’re going to continue to try to make these suggestions as relevant as possible,” said the Facebook spokesperson by email. “Concerning how People You May Know works; we prioritize suggestions based on mutual friends because having friends in common is a good signal that you may want to be friends with someone on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;amp;Query=PN/8521661&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;amp;Query=PN/8521661', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;earliest People You May Know patent&lt;/a&gt; was filed in 2010, two years after Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/people-you-may-know/15610312130&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/people-you-may-know/15610312130', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;launched the feature&lt;/a&gt;. In it, employees from Facebook explain why friend suggestions are important:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social networking systems value user connections because better connected users tend to use the social networking system more, thus increasing user engagement and providing a better user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a patent filed &lt;a href=&quot;http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20140114774.PGNR.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20140114774.PGNR.', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;, employees on Facebook’s growth team explain why increased user engagement is so important. It leads to “a corresponding increase in, for example, advertising opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, People You May Know is crucial to Facebook’s bottom line. Thus, Facebook’s first PYMK patent was on the process of privileging friend recommendations for people who don’t have very many friends. &lt;a href=&quot;http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20140289237.PGNR.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=20140289237.PGNR.', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Another filing&lt;/a&gt; patents the act of aggressively displaying “People You May Know” to people who don’t use Facebook very often.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Its second patent was for something Facebook doesn’t currently let you do: sort its friend suggestions to you and rank them by hometown or number of mutual friends or their interests. (If you’re interested in actually being able to do that, try &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/keep-track-of-who-facebook-thinks-you-know-with-this-ni-1819422352&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/keep-track-of-who-facebook-thinks-you-know-with-this-ni-1819422352', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;our PYMK Inspector&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you sort your friend suggestions by mutual friends.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of its patents is for figuring out who your family members are and suggesting them as friends. It says it could figure this out based on “external feeds, third-party databases, etc.” However, when Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-figured-out-my-family-secrets-and-it-wont-tel-1797696163&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-figured-out-my-family-secrets-and-it-wont-tel-1797696163', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;suggested I friend a relative I didn’t know I had&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook told me it doesn’t use information from third parties or data brokers for People You May Know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Facebook says it often seeks patents for technology it never implements, one thing Facebook &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; doing—and that it has filed multiple patents on since 2012 because it works so well—is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;building shadow profiles to connect users&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook collects all the contact information it can find for you from other users’ address books and then associates it with your account—though not in a place you can see or delete. It then uses that information to connect you with other users who have those contact deets for you. In patent speak, this is “Associating received contact information with user profiles stored by a social networking system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how Facebook describes the process of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691#_ga=2.47261984.680018856.1515415208-1695488106.1512405280&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691#_ga=2.47261984.680018856.1515415208-1695488106.1512405280', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;figuring out everyone you’ve ever met&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[U]ser profiles may include incomplete or outdated information, limiting the social networking system’s ability to identify other social networking system users for connecting to an importing user. To more accurately identify users, the social networking system stores contact entries received from an importing user and associates a stored contact entry with a user profile including information matching information in the contact entry. Subsequently received contact entries are compared to user profiles and stored contact entries associated with the user profile to identify matching information. If information in a user profile or in a stored contact entry associated with the user profile matches a received contact entry, a user associated with the user profile is identified for establishing a connection. Associating received contact entries with user profiles supplements user profiles with received content information, allowing identification of more potential connections to users and increasing user interaction with the social networking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, more user interaction means more opportunities to look at ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Facebook continues to grow, through app acquisitions and claiming new &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-launches-new-messenger-app-for-young-kids-what-1820972251&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-launches-new-messenger-app-for-young-kids-what-1820972251', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;demographics&lt;/a&gt; and countries as users, it will do its best to connect those new users to its existing billion-plus members. We can’t know when or if Facebook will ever actually scan digital photos for dust or tap into our phones’ gyrometers to more fully map the relationships between all the people in the world, but we now know, thanks to the U.S. Patent Office, that Facebook at least thinks these things are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that kind of thinking happening internally at Facebook, it’s hard not to start thinking of it more as a spy service than a social network. If these techniques were put into practice, it would be an incredibly invasive level of tracking in service of suggesting you connect with people that you may not actually want Facebook to know that you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
It looks like as of Chromium 71, nouveau is completely blacklisted.

I don't really see a way back from this, since they don't cite any
easily reproducible issues, except that some people had some issues
with indeterminate hardware and indeterminate versions of mesa.

In the bug that triggered this
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=876523&quot;&gt;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=876523&lt;/a&gt;), where
I might have slightly lost my cool, they (at the end) suggested that
we try to make nouveau a first-class citizen with chromium. However I
will never be able to present concrete evidence that inconcrete issues
are resolved. I did run the WebGL CTS suite, but that resulted in some
hangs from the the max-texture-size-equivalent test, and some
browser-level weirdness after some tests where later tests all fail
(due to what I have to assume is a browser bug). I don't think I
managed to properly track down the true reason why. I didn't want to
reach out to them with such results, as that's just further evidence
of nouveau not working perfectly.

In the meanwhile, end users are losing accelerated WebGL which in
practice worked just fine (at least in my usage of it), and probably
some other functionality.

One idea is to flip GL_VENDOR to some random string if chromium is
running. I don't like this idea, but I also don't have any great
alternatives. We can also just take this, as yet-another nail in the
nouveau coffin.

Opinions welcome.

Cheers,

  -ilia

<title>Syncthing graduation day</title>
<link>https://forum.syncthing.net/t/syncthing-graduation-day/12617</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://forum.syncthing.net/t/syncthing-graduation-day/12617</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks a milestone of sorts. It’s the first day of the new year and, as it also happens to be the first Tuesday of the month, it’s a Syncthing release day. Today is also &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; Syncthing’s birthday; the first public release was “0.2” on December 30, 2013, five years and two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all of this I thought this would be a good day to let Syncthing graduate and become a 1.0 kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like a black belt in martial art doesn’t indicate that you’ve learned all there is to know, a 1.0 version doesn’t mean Syncthing is &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;. There is a lot left to do and learn. At the same time we need to be aware that Syncthing is used “in production”. Syncthing gets roughly a million downloads of each stable release, just from Github, and syncs probably hundreds of terabytes of changes each day. Our users are entrusting precious data to Syncthing. We need to treat that trust with respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as a version number means anything at all, a “major zero” version number means that you can expect breakage. This is not what we want to communicate. Especially, it’s not the mindset that we should have towards our users. Hence Syncthing is now graduating from being in perpetual beta to being actual release software, yet the journey of development continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing as this is a new major release Syncthing will also be granted a new code name. The &lt;em&gt;Dysprosium Dragonfly&lt;/em&gt; took flight with 0.14.0 in July 2016. Now it morphs into the alphabetically adjacent &lt;em&gt;Erbium Earthworm&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Enjoy your regularly scheduled Syncthing release, thank you all for these five years, and we look forward to five more years of continued relevance and increasing stability. &lt;img src=&quot;https://forum.syncthing.net/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=6&quot; title=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who might wonder how this release relates to the 0.14.55-rc.2 release candidate, the answer is that it’s identical apart from the code name and version number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy graduation day syncthing and thank you so much to all contributors and programmers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jakob, how about a small look into the future for syncthing? I’d love to see that syncfolders would have a seperate index database. And a database reset button &amp;lt;3. I really love to use syncthing as a anti-bit-rot check system (i already do^^).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there could be a AWS syncthing instance with encrypted hash and data saving done by syncthing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or some kind of managing tool which could be sold seperately and you can add all your syncthing devices to. One master syncthing running which shows the extended managing website where all devices are shown and are manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could be a performance testing special folder which collects data about the whole device like hashing performance, network p., storage p. and runs through some tests to determine the max performance or reasonable performance with max. 50% used system resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ideas but I don’t dictate the future and direction; the community at large does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management tool you think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kastelo.net/arigi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d been wondering when this would happen, particularly since the introduction of receive-only folders. The difference in functionality between 0.14.0 and 0.14.54 is enormous despite compatibility, so it’s nice to see this acknowledged in some more obvious way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Syncthing still have three-part version numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;quote no-group&quot; data-post=&quot;4&quot; data-topic=&quot;12617&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;20&quot; height=&quot;20&quot; src=&quot;https://forum.syncthing.net/user_avatar/forum.syncthing.net/jking/40/2876_1.png&quot; class=&quot;avatar&quot;/&gt; JKing:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Syncthing still have three-part version numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes it will. For now the release schedule will be the same, just that there is an option to go to 1.0.1 or 1.1.0. There is already a general idea, but the specifics of how that will be handled are still under consideration. For now there’s more or less no change to how it happened before. Anything else will be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, and thanks to everyone involved for all their hard work on this project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations everybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been very active recently but I’m still lurking around and it’s been great to watch the project grow and flourish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note I like how Syncthing has become kind of a set it and forget it. I got it syncing things between a couple of servers I got and I have barely touched them for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the results surprised me. Did they surprise you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that some of the wrong answers can be fixed with various workarounds. For example Common–Lisp gives the correct answer for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(let ((*read-default-float-format* 'long-float))
  (- (read-from-string &quot;9999999999999999.0&quot;) (read-from-string &quot;9999999999999998.0&quot;)))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and Perl will give the correct answer for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
perl -mMath::BigFloat -e 'print Math::BigFloat-&amp;gt;new(&quot;9999999999999999.0&quot;)
 - Math::BigFloat-&amp;gt;new(&quot;9999999999999998.0&quot;);print &quot;\n&quot;;'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using one of these workarounds requires a certain prescience of the data domain, so they were not generally considered for the table above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that GoLang will produce the correct answer for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
fmt.Printf(&quot;%f\n&quot;, 9999999999999999.0-9999999999999998.0)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but not if the values are read. That Go uses arbitrary-precision for constant expressions seems dangerous to me.If I didn't include your favorite language, or if you think I misrepresented the canonical way to subtract two numbers in your favorite language, please let me know: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:geocar@sdf.lonestar.org&quot;&gt;geocar@sdf.lonestar.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Kubernetes development with no stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tilt helps you develop your microservices locally without slowing you down or making you play Twenty Questions with &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions? Comments? Just want to say hi? Find us on the Kubernetes slack in &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CESBL84MV/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#tilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;tilt up&lt;/code&gt; to start working on your services in a complete dev environment configured for your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tilt watches what you're working on so that it can bring your environment up-to-date in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screencast below demonstrates what a typical Tilt session looks like: starting multiple microservices, making changes to them, and seeing any new errors or logs right in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGeUUmdtdKA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/raw/master/docs/_static/demothumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;screencast&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install Tilt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know where to start, start here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tilt.build/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Complete Tilt User Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the Tilt binary on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/releases&quot;&gt;the github releases page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tilt expects that you already have Docker and &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; installed. Read the more detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tilt.build/install.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Installation Guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you &lt;code&gt;tilt up&lt;/code&gt; quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configure Your Workflow to Share With Your Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down with YAML!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure Tilt with a &lt;code&gt;Tiltfile&lt;/code&gt;, written in a small subset of Python called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark#tour&quot;&gt;Starlark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, check out some &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tilt.build/first_example.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; or dive into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.tilt.build/api.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;API reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>75% of med students are on antidepressants, stimulants, or both? (2017)</title>

&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever been depressed as a physician?” I asked 220 doctors. Ninety percent stated yes. Yet few seek professional help. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/depressed-doctors-nobodys-looking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Here’s what depressed doctors do (when nobody’s looking)&lt;/a&gt;. Some drink alcohol, exercise obsessively, even steal psychiatric meds. Still more shocking—I discovered that 75% of med students (and new doctors) are now on psychiatric medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was told by the psychologist at my med school’s campus assistance program, that 75% of the class of 175 people were on antidepressants,” shares psychiatrist Dr. Jaya V. Nair. “He wasn’t joking. How broken is the system, that doctors have to be pushed into illness in order to be trained to do their job?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During my internship, I found out that at least 75% of my fellow residents were on SSRIs or other antidepressants, just ‘to get through it’ because it was so horrible.” states Dr. Joel Cooper, “Depression, or a constantly depressed state, is more or less the norm in medical school and throughout one’s residency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I left my residency, I was alarmed to find out that about 75% of my fellow residents had started antidepressants since their intern year,” says Dr. Jill Fadal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems the epidemic of depressed doctors begins in medical school. I wondered how best to verify this oft-repeated 75% statistic. Just then a student called to tell me what her professor said during orientation: “Look around the room. By the end of your first year, two-thirds of your class will be on antidepressants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m appalled. Yet she’s grateful. Why? Her school is so progressive. They normalize the need for antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must be out of touch. Do most med students require psych drugs for day-to-day survival? I turned my question over to Facebook: “75% of med students and residents are taking either stimulants or antidepressants or both. True or false?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s absolutely, horrifyingly, true. It is a symptom of a great sickness in MedEd.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sadly I am guessing true as I prescribed some for my residents every year that I worked in a residency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True, but I’m sure a lot is unprescribed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would assume definitely true, Ritalin, Adderall, energy drinks, ephedrine. Yep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While working as a nurse at a major Army hospital, I was astounded by the number of medical students on Adderall or Ritalin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on an antidepressant since being premed—18 years now. Little did I know it would be impossible to wean myself off and that my entire class was using Adderall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True but most take them in secret as there are negative consequences and stigma that come with getting your mental health addressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very true. From my practical point of view, I’d put medical students &amp;amp; residents at 100%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take both Zoloft and Adderall daily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very much so true—the percentages may actually be higher. I see it in my classes and I’m only a premed student.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If coffee counts as a stimulant it’s definitely 100%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only way I’d say false is to say it’s higher. I’d say a quarter of my class had to take a leave for a mental health break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having received Facebook confirmation that most med students are on psych drugs, I then queried 1800 medical students via email with the same question and encouraged respondents to share personal experiences. To prevent professional retaliation, all quotes are published anonymously (with permission).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am one of the many who are currently on BOTH antidepressants (2 types) &amp;amp; a stimulant (amphetamine). I lost my very dear friend (also a classmate) to suicide in my third year of med school. I have been on psych treatment since then.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hi Dr. Wible. The number sounds high, but whether it is right or wrong is anybody’s guess. I can tell you about myself and my girlfriend—we both just started our third year at a DO medical school. I use 100 mg Sertraline to treat panic/anxiety attacks that were very bad when we had practical exams. I am also very depressed, but the Sertraline does nothing for this. I was diagnosed with ADD in 2013, right before taking the MCAT. I have been on and off of amphetamines and Concerta since then. Then there’s the alcohol and marijuana for the end of the day when I just get too tired of thinking. I have been offered various benzos by my family doctor to help treat the anxiety attacks. I haven’t filled that prescription, but do use them (from a friend) occasionally to help sleep, escape life etc. This is coming from someone who never touched alcohol or other drugs/mind-altering substances until I was 25-ish right at the time of taking the MCAT. My now significant other also uses Sertraline, Adderall, and Benzos to treat anxiety/panic attacks and ADD. Coincidence? I doubt it. So my sample size is two, but 100% are taking antidepressants and stimulants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True. I’m on them, and every student I know is on them too. I’m on both; never took them before med school. Same with all of my friends. Eek!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do recall around board study season hearing from half of my classmates about sharing Adderall and getting Rx from doctors they knew. I was even offered it, but never tried. However, my coffee intake has definitely gone up since school to the point having trouble controlling my bladder. I also know of about half of my friends taking antidepressants throughout school. So I would guess at least 50-75% of my class took stimulants and/or antidepressants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I tried two types of antidepressants in medical school, lost more than 200 thousand dollars, and almost ended up homeless from medical school. All [my depression and debt] started in medical school. Yet my passion remains.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hi Pamela, I agree! Students are afraid to speak about it and I know some who have even asked friends/family to get meds under their name so it isn’t on their record. I finally started talking about it with my classmates and found that many of my close friends were taking them and we had individually struggled alone not knowing there were others going through the same thing. Also, if everyone’s doing it and it gives you an edge, then everyone else has to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sounds about right. I never needed antidepressants before medical school. And it definitely made me rely on higher doses of methylphenidate than I’ve needed in the past.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never thought I would take study drugs. But I was near the bottom of the class in my exam results, and then found out that several who were best in our year were taking study drugs. I cut my losses and copied them. Low and behold, my results improved drastically. I don’t like it, but for me it is better than falling behind and doing poorly. All my friends at other med schools use Modafinil and Adderall too. They also use recreational drugs like ecstasy, cocaine and acid when they’re partying. Drug use is very common amongst the med students I know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my med school class, I’ve heard of people on antidepressants, on sleeping pills, using pot to calm down, and then also on some kind of uppers for test days and days after partying which the partying was to de-stress..but I have no idea if it’s 75%…I don’t know enough of my class well enough to have that info, nor do I think anyone does…there are usually cliques of up to 25 people, but for people to say they know for sure details of 75% of their class would be hard for me to believe but maybe…there is a lot of it, I agree with that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True. As a med student I was on antidepressants. No different now I am intern. Having just finished 12 days straight and &amp;gt;120 hrs. I can understand why people are also using stimulants.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True. I only have four friends in medical school that I know well enough to know which meds they take. All are on both. I went to the university psychiatrist in my Texas premed program for depression he asked when I felt better I told him when I took my friends stimulants to study, I expected him to give me a verbal wrist slap instead he gave me a script. I was on a steady dose for years but the first year of med school I kept upping the dose to try and keep up, ended up deciding I needed to stop after one episode of not sleeping for four days and having auditory hallucinations. Failed second year when I quit them cold turkey, didn’t feel like I was keeping up without them so switched to Modafinil which is much mellower than amphetamine but definitely not good for me. Everyone started antidepressants in school even folks without a history of depression. Being completely honest 75% seems a bit high, but I wouldn’t be that surprised if it were true, in my n=5 study it’s 100%.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“True. But that number may be higher or lower depending on the school and year in med school. I was on an antidepressant in the last month of last semester because all my other coping skills weren’t enough. I’m on summer break and I haven’t needed any medications to be functional and happy. My depression was entirely induced by the stress and frustrations encountered during medical school.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was on an inpatient internal medicine rotation working 12-14 hour days 6 days a week (as a 3rd year med student) and would ‘keep it together’ at the hospital and fall apart on the way home, cry and sleep to cope. It was the first time in my life I felt suicidal, no plans—just wanted to fade away. My husband was afraid to leave me alone. I put myself back on the Lexapro, equalized somewhat and kept pushing on. That all happened around Christmas of last year. In June I finally was able to find a psychiatrist. He put me on a trial of Adderall. I was hesitant due to the abuse potential but decided to give it a try. With the two meds I have less anxiety, way better at prioritizing, and my focus is improved. I’m studying for step 2 currently so time will tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take Effexor 150mg QD. In addition to 10mg of amphetamine salts TID. I used to drink 2 quad shot white chocolate mochas from Starbucks a day, but with the stimulant I threw myself into SVT too frequently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot talk about anything beyond what I know of my immediate friend circle but I have in mind about 10 examples of people who started NEW prescriptions for 1) Stimulants for studying and staying awake 2) Antidepressants and/or mood stabilizers and one person who was started on 3) Beta blockers for new onset panic. These are people with new diagnoses since starting school. I know a few others who came in on these medications after having hard times as premeds (or earlier, I don’t know) That’s just those who actually got the prescription…. As I’m sure you know there is unfortunately also a great deal of illegal procurement of prescription medications as well as abuse of illegal drugs. An increase in alcohol abuse is also a major concern. People are self-medicating left and right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I would not be surprised! I know 10 people from 5 different schools and at least 7 are on either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am lucky to have a great support structure and have coped quite well so far without needing any medication. I am actually diagnosed with ADHD and have a prescription for two medications which I don’t really use. The pressure to use them every day rather than relying on my own hard-won compensatory skills is certainly there. Interestingly, I am not shy about my diagnosis and talk about it openly to destigmatize it but I have actually cut back on that because if I’m not careful I inevitably get a lot of classmates asking if they can have some of my medication. For a future doctor to brazenly ask for illegal sharing of medicine is worrisome to me but again I do understand the pressure (to stay up just one more hour studying) that drives the behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Popping prescription bottle caps and chafing of pills while studying in the library is a fixture of how daunting the pressures of medical school really are. Med school libraries are dungeons where souls came to die. You’re surrounded by absolute dread—the look of despair painted across the faces of your fellow classmates who feel at any second their life could be ruined with one failing grade. Most of my friends were on SSRI’s, Benzodiazepines, and various types of stimulants. I once asked a friend if he had anything to help me go to sleep and he recommended Lorazepam, which he gave me. The ‘top student’ in our class was rumored to be a serial user of cocaine. To avoid having a drug test reveal his dirty little secret prior to third year, he took a hiatus by engineering a family emergency to give himself adequate time to pass the contents of amphetamine (he passed). Elicit substances in medical school may seem like taboo to lay persons, however in our eyes, it’s a natural and regular experience. In fact, it is astounding how many medical students (myself included) smoke marijuana in order to experience a night of restful sleep. With each puff, it’s as if I escape a bit from my hectic reality. A reality dominated by judging, vengeful, and heartless administrators/faculty who can care less if we live or die, as long as we perform on USMLE Step 1. Yup, its that bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, even I was severely depressed as a first-year med student. So my mom (a psychiatrist) mailed me a bottle of Trazodone. I thought I was the only one crying myself to sleep. Turns out occupationally-induced depression is rampant in medical training. Now schools dole out antidepressants like candy. Stimulants are used by med students like steroids in athletes. So where do we go from here? Should “progressive” med schools distribute samples of Zoloft and Adderall during orientation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem is physicians must answer mental health questions (right next to questions on felonies and DUIs) to secure a medical license, hospital privileges, and participate with insurance plans. Check the YES box and be forced to disclose your “confidential” medical history and defend yourself—again and again for your &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; career. Treated like a criminal for taking meds to cope with the torment of medical training (and practice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6556&quot; src=&quot;http://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Physician License ApplicationStigma&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma.jpg 1024w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-750x563.jpg 750w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-100x75.jpg 100w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-200x150.jpg 200w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.idealmedicalcare.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ApplicationStigma-900x675.jpg 900w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s why so many future (and current) physicians sneak drugs and go off-the-grid for mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been in practice 20 years and have been on antidepressants and anxiolytics for all of that time,” says Jason. “I drive 300 miles to seek care and always pay in cash. I am forced to lie on my state relicensing every year. There is no way in hell I would ever disclose this to the medical board—they are not our friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we stop the mental health witch hunt on our doctors? Why not replace threats and punishment with safe confidential care? What if we address the root of the problem—the great sickness in medical education—rather than shifting blame to 75% of medical students for not having enough serotonin or dopamine or norepinephrine in their brains?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As scientists, we can’t continue to approach medical education reform as a neurotransmitter deficiency in medical students. Can we?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Wible, M.D., is a family physician in Oregon. She is happy in her solo practice and takes no psychiatric medication. Turns out her depression was environmental—entirely related to the culture of medical education.

&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;⚠️ This code works on the most recent version of ReCaptcha. Only use on sites you control for educational purposes. ⚠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in April 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha&quot;&gt;unCaptcha&lt;/a&gt; achieved 85% accuracy defeating Google's ReCaptcha. After the release of this work, Google released an update to ReCaptcha with the following major changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better browser automation detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoken phrases rather than digits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes were initially successful in protecting against the original unCaptcha attack. However, as of June 2018, these challenges have been solved. We have been in contact with the ReCaptcha team for over six months and they are fully aware of this attack. The team has allowed us to release the code, despite its current success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the changes to the audio challenge, passing ReCaptcha is easier than ever before. The code now only needs to make a single request to a free, publicly available speech to text API to achieve around &lt;em&gt;90% accuracy&lt;/em&gt; over all captchas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the changes to ReCaptcha prevent Selenium, a browser automation engine, unCaptcha2 uses a screen clicker to move to certain pixels on the screen and move around the page like a human. There is certainly work to be done here - the coordinates need to be updated for each new user and is not the most robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unCaptcha2's approach is very simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate to Google's ReCaptcha Demo site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to audio challenge for ReCaptcha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download audio challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit audio challenge to Speech To Text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse response and type answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press submit and check if successful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14065974/45004579-df021180-afbb-11e8-8598-177159ed09b4.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14065974/45004579-df021180-afbb-11e8-8598-177159ed09b4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;vid&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since unCaptcha2 has to go to specific coordinates on the screen, you'll need to update the coordinates based on your setup. These coordinates are located at the top of run.py. On Linux, using the command &lt;code&gt;xdotool getmouselocation --shell&lt;/code&gt; to find the coordinates of your mouse may be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll also need to set your credentials for whichever speech-to-text API you choose. Since Google's, Microsoft's, and IBM's speech-to-text systems seem to work the best, those are already included in queryAPI.py. You'll have to set the username and password as required; for Google's API, you'll have to set an environment variable (GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS) with a file containing your Google application credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, install the dependencies, using &lt;code&gt;pip install -r dependencies.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contacted the Recaptcha team in June 2018 to alert them that the updates to the Recaptcha system made it less secure, and a formal issue was opened on June 27th, 2018. We demonstrated a fully functional version of this attack soon thereafter. We chose to wait 6 months after the initial disclosure to give the Recaptcha team time to address the underlying architectural issues in the Recaptcha system. The Recaptcha team is aware of this attack vector, and have confirmed they are okay with us releasing this code, despite its current success rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attack vector was deemed out of scope for the bug bounty program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unCaptcha2, like the original version, is meant to be a proof of concept. As Google updates its service, this repository will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be updated. As a result, it is not expected to work in the future, and is likely to break at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to Google's work in browser automation detection, this version of unCaptcha does not use Selenium. As a result, the code has to navigate to specific parts of the screen. To see unCaptcha working for yourself, you will need to change the coordinates for your screen resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While unCaptcha2 is tuned for Google's Demo site, it can be changed to work for any such site - the logic for defeating ReCaptcha will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have removed our API keys from all the necessary queries. If you are looking to recreate some of the work or are doing your own research in this area, you will need to acquire API keys from each of the six services used. These keys are delineated in our files by a long string of the character 'X'. It's worth noting that the only protection against creating multiple API keys is ReCaptcha - therefore, unCaptcha could be made self sufficient by solving captchas to sign up for new API keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks to everyone who puts up with me, including,&lt;/p&gt;
