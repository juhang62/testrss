<title>Making a Game Boy Game in 2017</title>
<link>https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20171207/311143/Making_a_Game_Boy_game_in_2017_A_quotSheep_It_Upquot_PostMortem_part_12.php</link>

<description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra’s community.&lt;br/&gt;The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has childhood dreams. Mine was to make a game for my first console: the Nintendo Game Boy. Today, I fulfilled this dream, by &lt;strong&gt;releasing my first Game Boy game on a actual cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll present the tools I used, and some pitfalls a newcomer like me had to overcome to make this project a reality! Due to it's length, this article will be split in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Sheep It Up!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is an arcade game where a sheep has to climb up by hanging himself to flying velcro straps. The concept is simple, but the game rapidly gets quite challenging: how high can you climb without falling down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sheep It Up! gameplay&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a game collector myself, I wanted this game to be produced without sacrificing any vintage Game Boy titles. So everything is manufactured specifically for this game: the pcb, the rom, the shell, the protective case and even the sticker! We also tried to keep the price reasonable, so everyone can enjoy the game: &lt;strong&gt;$15 (+shipping)&lt;/strong&gt;. It will run on any Game Boy model, from the first one to the GBA SP, including the Super Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still own a Game Boy, you can buy a cartridge on the publisher website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the 90's, creating game for a 8-bit game console was a real challenge, and required a team of highly trained professionals. Designers, artists and developers from this era are real heroes to me: to be able to produce such wonderful games with the limited tools they had compared the ones we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, it's still a lot of work to make a game for a 8-bit console. But, thanks to the wonderful homebrew communities, we now have a lot of tools to make our life easier! Without them, an hobbyist like me could never be able create a Game Boy game on his own. So, what are those tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starter, the programming language. Back in the day, all dedicated gaming hardware was programmed in Assembly. It's still possible (and even recommended) to use Assembly today. But it's no longer the only option, as many devkits for 8-bits and 16-bits consoles are based on the C programming language. For the Game Boy, this awesome tool is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Developers Kit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBDK).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to make art and level design, you no longer need to use graph paper and a hand scanner. Hopefully, you can now use two complementary piece of software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Designer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBTD)&lt;/em&gt;. It will allow you draw sprites and tiles, and to export them in a binary format that can be read by a Game Boy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Map Builder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBMB). &lt;/em&gt; This one will let you build level and background image using the tiles drawn with GBTD &lt;em&gt;(it's kind of like Tiled, but for Game Boy)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtd.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we also need a way to test our game. This is where modernity is key. While in the 90's developers had to use expensive ICE boxes, today we have powerful software emulators that can run on any computer. To test your own game, the best choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bgb.bircd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BGB&lt;/a&gt;. It's a very accurate Game Boy emulator that comes with a powerful debugger, the one tool you'll need to create a working game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/bgb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game is in top-right corner, all the other scary windows are the various debugger tools!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be really sure your game is working, you will also need to test it on real hardware. In the 90's, people were burning their program on a EPROM chip, and used some special cartridges to plug this chip into an actual Game Boy. While efficient, it was quite a lengthy and expensive process. Today, we have what are called &quot;Flashcarts&quot;: cartridges where you can plug a SD card with your game ROM to play it on an actual Game Boy. The idea is the same, but the tools are more easily accessible and faster to use. Several Game Boy Flashcarts exists, but the best one is arguably the one built by Krikzz: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://krikzz.com/store/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Everdrive Game Boy.&lt;/a&gt; A newer and improved model was released this summer, but I used the old version that I bought some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gb_eprom3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/everdrive-gb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flashcart from the 90's vs one from the 2010's&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these great tools available in 2017, making a game today for a 1989 game console is still a challenge. Especially for people who have been trained to use &quot;modern tools&quot;, such as Unity, Unreal Engine or Godot. Here are the main challenges I faced during the development of &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;, including the things that surprised me about how a Game Boy is actually working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Size limitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the obvious one: &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt; is a rather simple game. One factor that explains this fact is that the whole game weights &lt;strong&gt;only 32KB&lt;/strong&gt;. Yup, the code, the images, and even the sounds are all fitting in a tiny 32KB space. To give you a point of comparison, 32KB is the size of the Wikipedia logo in a very tiny resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;                     &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/LogoWikipedia32k.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;           Full Game: 32KB                            160x146px (PNG-24): 32KB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every Game Boy game fits in 32KB. For me, it was a technical limitation to be able to release the game on an actual cartridge &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20180213/314554/&quot;&gt;more details in part 2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. The best and most famous Game Boy titles are actually way larger than that :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Red / Blue&lt;/strong&gt; are 1024KB (so huge!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wario Land&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zelda Link's Awakening&lt;/strong&gt; are 512KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby Dream Land&lt;/strong&gt; is 256KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gargoyle's Quest&lt;/strong&gt; is 128KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, few Game Boy titles are only 32KB. Most of them are from the early life of the console. For example, both &lt;strong&gt;Alleyway&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(one of the Game Boy launch title in Japan)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tetris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(launch title in US and Europe)&lt;/em&gt; are 32KB games. These are both excellent titles, but due to their tiny cartridge space, they are also somewhat &quot;limited&quot; in scope: &lt;em&gt;single screen, few different graphical and audio assets, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/game-boy-alleyway.jpg&quot;/&gt;       &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/Tetris.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alleyway and Tetris are 32KB games, like Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CPU: playing with Portable Power!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Boy is powered by a &lt;strong&gt;4MHz CPU&lt;/strong&gt;, custom built for the console &lt;em&gt;(it's a mix between Zilog's Z80 and Intel's 8080 processors)&lt;/em&gt;. All in all, Gameboy processing power is comparable to a NES, and even a bit more powerful due the reduced screen size and colors to display &lt;em&gt;(more on that latter)&lt;/em&gt;. Despite a mere 4Mhz speed, all the Game Boy games are displayed in &lt;strong&gt;constant 60fps&lt;/strong&gt;. Take that PS4 Pro and Xbox One X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for a programmer fresh out of college, the biggest constraints will be that it's a 8-bits processor. As you may know, internally all the computers are using 0 and 1 to process data. A single digit, which can have either 0 or 1 as value, is called a &quot;bit&quot; &lt;em&gt;(short for &quot;binary digit&quot;, as it can only have two different values)&lt;/em&gt;. A processor is defined as &quot;8-bits&quot; if it can process 8 bits of data in a single operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it affect the making of video games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the less &quot;bits&quot; the CPU can process, the more limited will your gameplay variables be. For example, in games we use a lot of integers numbers to represent values: life, speed, score, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 8 bits of data, an integer can store smaller numbers than a 16 bits variable :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-128 to 127&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 255 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-32768 to 32767&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 65535 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's still obscure for you, let's take a concrete example from &lt;em&gt;Sheet It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_score.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this picture, the score variable has 5 digits, and can range from 0 to 99999. Sadly, it's way larger than what a 8 bits integer variable can store. I mean, even a 16 bits integer variable isn't enough to hold such a &quot;large&quot; score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to be able to track score in Sheep It Up!, I had to use not one, but five different 8 bits integer variables to store the player score. I let you guess how &quot;fun&quot; it was to handle all these variables, especially when I added the ability to keep a high score, thus I had to compare two values stored across 5 different variables. Programming on a 8 bits system will force you to come up with complex solutions like that all the time, while modern systems will simply use 32 bits or 64 bits variables and never pose such a problem to their programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(N.B. for experienced game developers: I know that I could have been more efficient than using a whole int8 to store a single digit ranging from 0 to 9. But I actually needed each variable to be able to go from 0 to 255, as in reality I don't store the score digit directly, but the tile id used to display this number on the screen)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;One world, two planes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any image displayed on the Game Boy is composed of two elements: a background layer (BKG) and several moving objects, also called sprites (OBJ). You are limited to a maximum on 40 sprites onscreen, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_planes.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;              Background (BKG)                                      Sprites (OBJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it's a bit more complex than that, as there is an additional &quot;window&quot; layer than can scroll differently from the background. It's usually used to make the user interface (score, etc.).  But this layer is &quot;non-transparent&quot;: it will hide any graphical data on the background layer behind it. So, for the sake of simplicity, you can consider that you have a single &quot;background&quot; layer on a Game Boy, but that you can make part of it scrolling independently if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Boy sees 4 colors!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's introduce the elephant in the room: the original Game Boy model can only display 4 different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_colors(1).png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can argue that it's not really Light Grey and Dark Grey, but rather Light Green and Dark Green, but that's not the point: you can only use 4 colors to draw our art. At least, as long as you are drawing the background, because the case is different with sprites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as you can see in this picture, the Sheep is drawn with 3 colors only. Why is that? Actually, I drew the sprite with 4 colors. But the 4th color, here &quot;Black&quot;, is simply not displayed because it's used as &quot;transparent color&quot; by the Game Boy. That way, the sprites are not all &quot;square images&quot;, but they can be a wide variety of shapes allowing to see the background image behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it mean that I cannot use black to draw sprites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not, as you can see below with the &quot;velcro&quot; strap sprite. For this sprite, I actually used a different palette of 3+1 colors: &quot;White&quot; is used as transparent color, and &quot;Black&quot; is displayed on the sprite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fun with palettes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being limited to 4 colors only, the Game Boy actually uses 3 different palettes to display images, and that's very cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_palettes.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there is a single &quot;4 colors&quot; palette for the background layer, and two &quot;3 colors + 1 transparent color&quot; palettes that the sprites can use &lt;em&gt;(each sprite can use one palette or the other)&lt;/em&gt;. The cool thing about these palettes is that you can freely assign any color you want to any palette slot. This allow you to make some nice effects, such as the fade-in / fade-out seen in many games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_fade_anim2.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a fade-in on a Game Boy, you simply need modify the colors on the 3 palettes. In the first step, all the palette slots are filled with white color. Then, in Step 2, the darkest color slot (black) is filled with light gray, to progressively reveal the image. In Step 3, Light Gray becomes Dark Gray, and so on, until the 4 colors are displayed on each palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a similar method, we can also make a character &quot;blink&quot;, by switching the colors on its palette every frame. For example, this method is used when Mario catch a star and become invincible in Super Mario Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tiling the world!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one last oddity in the way a Game Boy display images, at least for a game developer trained on current-gen engines. As the console doesn't have a &quot;frame buffer&quot;, you can't specify the color of each pixel on screen individually. Indeed, all the on-screen images are built by assembling loads of &quot;tiles&quot;, i.e. 8x8 pixels squares. This is applicable for both background and sprites :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique, designed to reduce the amount of video RAM needed to display images, implies that you can't draw freehand lines on the Game Boy screen. But it's also one of the secret that makes the Game Boy able to display such beautiful games with a mere 4Mhz CPU and only 8KB of video RAM &lt;em&gt;(yes, I wrote kilobytes and not megabytes or gigabytes).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the drawback of this tile-based display is that our &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;velcro&quot; sprites are actually made of more than one sprite. The Sheep is 16x16 pixels, so in theory it would need four 8x8 sprites to be displayed. Hopefully the Game Boy also have a 8x16 display mode for the sprites, meaning that in reality each object in Sheep It Up! is only made of two sprites, and not four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that we are &lt;strong&gt;limited to 40 sprites onscreen&lt;/strong&gt;, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy &lt;strong&gt;can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it means that we can't have more 5 sheep side by side on the same line, instead of 10 as you might have thought at first &lt;em&gt;(because the sheep is made of 2 sprites from an hardware point of view)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full-screen tiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't mention it yet, but the Game Boy screen resolution is 160x144 pixels. It means that you need 20x18 = &lt;strong&gt;360 tiles&lt;/strong&gt; to cover the whole screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the Game Boy VRAM is limited &lt;em&gt;(8KB)&lt;/em&gt;, and it can store only &lt;strong&gt;256 different tiles&lt;/strong&gt;. It means that, without any coding trick, you can't display a fullscreen image :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is to reuse tiles, as you can see, the tile image have a lot of &quot;empty space&quot;, meaning that a single &quot;white tile&quot; in RAM is placed several times on the image. In reality, the title screen image only uses 178 different tiles, meaning I still had room for some extra details if I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_rawtitletiles.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what method they followed to re-use tiles in the 90's, but today we have a very nice tool for that, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisantonellis.com/gameboy/gbtdg/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Data Generator&lt;/a&gt;. You feed it with a PNG image &lt;em&gt;(in 4 colors)&lt;/em&gt; and it will automatically generate you the tiles and the tilemap needed to display it on an actual Game Boy. Obviously, it will also automatically detect and reuse identical tiles to save as much video RAM as possible on the console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtdg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information, most of the 80s and 90's consoles work in a similar way, with 8x8 tiles-based display: &lt;em&gt;Nes, Master System, PC-Engine, Super Nintendo, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear...&lt;/em&gt; The first mainstream home consoles to have a frame buffer were the PlayStation and Saturn, and the first Nintendo handled to do it was the Game Boy Advance &lt;em&gt;(The Atari Lynx being the first handheld with individually addressable pixels)&lt;/em&gt;. So learning to &quot;work with tiles&quot; on the Game Boy is actually a &lt;strong&gt;transferable skill&lt;/strong&gt; if you later work on another retro game console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips from the pros: making 4 colors sprites!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's end with a little tip coming from the talented developers at Nintendo. Please look at this screenshot from Wario Land :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see how the coin, a sprite, is actually drawn with 4 colors? How did they perform such a feat, when I just told you that the Game Boy can only display 3 colors per sprite ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple : each coin is made of 2 sprites, and each sprite uses a different object palette. As you can see, when we split the coin in two halves, it's indeed made of two 8x16 sprites. As always with Nintendo, there is a great attention to detail: they didn't simply merged two &quot;sprites halves&quot;, but they draw them slightly tilted and they overlapped them by 1 pixels, so the coin feel more like a single element!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the first part of postmortem. Thanks for reading it this far! In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20180213/314554/&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, we'll discuss the audio challenges &lt;em&gt;(lot of oddities here too!)&lt;/em&gt;, and how the cartridges were built without destroying any previously existing Game Boy game. I'll also go over the feedback I received from players on &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_manyWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this article! And, if you still have a Game Boy laying around, don't forget that you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buy a beautiful Sheep It Up cartridge for a mere $15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Catskull games. Each cartridge will be assembled by hand before being sent to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;blog-post__section&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleSection&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Print edition | United States&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop=&quot;description&quot; readability=&quot;134&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;HE SALESMEN&lt;/small&gt; and women at the International Association of Chiefs of Police technology conference last week were as enthusiastic as ever. This in-car tablet had a tougher coating and less intrusive bezel; that radar gun had a clearer display and a faster processor. But conference veterans noted the lack of truly ground-breaking gear. Attitudes to police technology are changing—not only among American civilians but among the cops themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently Americans seemed willing to let police deploy new technologies in the name of public safety as they saw fit. But crime is much rarer than it was in the 1990s, and technological scepticism is growing. On May 14th San Francisco became the first American city to ban its agencies from using facial-recognition systems. That decision was profoundly unpopular at the police conference. Jack Marks, who manages Panasonic’s public-safety products, called it “short-sighted and reactive”. The technology exists, he said; “the best thing you can do is help shape it.” Other cities, including Somerville in Massachusetts, may soon follow San Francisco’s lead all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are under scrutiny, too. On May 22nd Amazon saw off two challenges by activist shareholders. They wanted the board to commission an independent study to determine whether Rekognition, its facial-recognition platform, imperils civil, human and privacy rights. The activists also wanted to ban the firm from selling Rekognition to governments until the company’s board concludes, “after an evaluation using independent evidence”, that it does not erode those rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior police officers argue that the technology is a useful crime-fighting tool. Daniel Steeves, chief information officer for the Ottawa Police Service, says that a robbery-investigation unit spent six months testing a facial-recognition system. It lowered the average time required for an officer to identify a subject from an image from 30 days to three minutes. The officers could simply run an image through a database of 50,000 mugshot photos rather than leafing through them manually or sending a picture to the entire department and asking if anybody recognised the suspect. Other officers stress that a facial-recognition match never establishes guilt. It is just a lead to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet officers sense that the technology is in bad odour. A deputy police chief from an American suburb with a security system that uses facial recognition around the local high school says: “We knew that facial recognition wasn’t going to fly, so we called it an Early Warning Detection System.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many distinguish between the sort of facial-recognition software that Mr Steeves’s department used, which matches suspects to mugshots already in a police database, to the more widely feared version—used in China, for instance—that blankets cities with cameras that employ facial recognition and monitors citizens accused of no crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others think the distinction less clear-cut. Matt Cagle, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, fears that “facial recognition is vulnerable to mission-creep and growth”. Even a system like the one in Ottawa requires building a database that could be used for less ethical purposes. Testifying before Congress on May 22nd, Clare Garvie—a facial-recognition expert at Georgetown Law’s Centre on Privacy and Technology—argued that because facial recognition can subject people to persistent secret surveillance, it presents “a unique threat to our civil rights and liberties”. Ms Garvie’s research has found that, conservatively, half of all Americans have their faces in databases to which the police can get access. Often the image is a drivers’ licence photo. She also noted that the technology is bad at identifying non-white faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes scepticism about technology comes from the cops. Earlier this year the &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported that many small police departments were abandoning body-worn-camera programmes because of the cost. Although the cameras are cheap, officers can generate 15 gigabytes of video per shift; storage costs mount. Police unions often oppose body-worn cameras, fearing they imperil their members by giving superior officers licence to search them for punishable behaviour. Other officers complain about the amount of time required to review and redact footage in response to public-information requests. They also seem not to work. A study from George Mason University released in March found that body-worn cameras had no “statistically significant or consistent effects” on people’s views on police, or on police or civilian behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this means that policing will become less technologically sophisticated, however. Even as the public and the police turn against some visible technologies, other ones are quietly being deployed. The most important innovations are invisible to most citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police have long gathered immense amounts of data, but have not always organised them well. Police complain about the amount of time they spend doing paperwork; others lament how hard it is to get accurate data from police departments. Several firms fishing for business at the conference in Jacksonville offered tools designed to organise the huge amounts of information that police take in, rather than gadgets that generate more of it. Such tools are supposed to present officers with as much information as possible as soon as they need it, and make data taken from disparate sources easily accessible and searchable. They are also supposed to organise data in such a way that the cops can see where they need to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Fisher, executive director of strategic initiatives for the Seattle Police Department, recently oversaw the building of a data system linking previously siloed streams of information, such as emergency-call records, stops based on reasonable suspicion, and police use of force. This let the department know precisely where disparities occur. Before, says Mr Fisher, they often relied on guesswork and anecdotal evidence to fill in the blanks. “Now we can know: in how many of our dispatches did it end up that a person was in crisis, and in that subset, how often did we use force?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axon, which makes body-worn cameras and Tasers (the police weapon that gave the firm its former name) is building a system for managing records. Jenner Holden, the firm’s chief information-security officer, says that “what we can do to help officers improve most isn’t the sexy stuff. It’s helping them be more efficient and spend more time on the street.” &lt;/p&gt;

However, to comply with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent order from the U.S. government&lt;/a&gt;, Google pulled the Chinese tech company and smartphone manufacturer Huawei’s license to use the proprietary Google software that sits on top of Android. In doing so, Google quietly exposed the powerful control it has over its supposedly open phone ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6804&quot; id=&quot;6804&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most Android manufacturers — including Huawei — are what’s known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.android.com/certified/partners/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.android.com/certified/partners/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google hardware partners&lt;/a&gt;. This relationship lets them build their phones around a collection of Google products, from apps like Google Maps and Assistant, to under-the-hood tools like location services or push notifications. While Google gives off the impression that Android is open and available to everyone, these services represent a quiet control that the company doesn’t often enforce over its hardware partners — though, as it has now proven, it certainly can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d20b&quot; id=&quot;d20b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With the recent order, the U.S. government forced Google’s hand. The U.S. Department of Commerce put &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/all-articles/17-regulations/1555-addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-final-rule-effective-may-16-2019&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/all-articles/17-regulations/1555-addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-final-rule-effective-may-16-2019&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huawei on the “Entity List,”&lt;/a&gt; which blocks it from buying technology from U.S. companies without government approval. Huawei and Google now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/google-will-work-with-huawei-for-next-90-days-after-restrictions-eased.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/google-will-work-with-huawei-for-next-90-days-after-restrictions-eased.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have three months&lt;/a&gt; to send updates to existing users. For new phones, Huawei &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/analysis-huawei-aosp-google-ban/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/analysis-huawei-aosp-google-ban/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;may be able to&lt;/a&gt; use the open-source version of Android, but it can’t be a Google partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;142e&quot; id=&quot;142e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The distinction between using Android and being a Google partner seems messy from the outside, but “Android” technically refers to the core operating system that covers basic things like making phone calls or using the camera. The freely available version of Android is called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and a company doesn’t have to be a partner to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;601c&quot; id=&quot;601c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most manufacturers like Huawei, however, do choose to become a Google partner. That means Huawei agrees to only make devices that use a collection of Google apps known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.android.com/gms/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.android.com/gms/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Mobile Services&lt;/a&gt; which includes things like Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Play Store. Under this arrangement, Huawei can’t, for example, make a phone that ships with Microsoft’s Bing and Edge instead of Google Search and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;424f&quot; id=&quot;424f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1024&quot; id=&quot;1024&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Partners also have to meet certain security and compatibility conditions. In exchange, they get access to all of Google’s apps and infrastructure, making their phones much more appealing to customers worldwide than they would otherwise be. This arrangement is usually free, though manufacturers who sell in the EU &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/17999366/google-eu-android-licensing-terms&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/19/17999366/google-eu-android-licensing-terms&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pay a fee&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-to-charge-oems-for-android-apps-in-the-eu/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-to-charge-oems-for-android-apps-in-the-eu/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exempt from the all-or-nothing condition&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17984074/google-eu-android-licensing-bundle-chrome-search&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17984074/google-eu-android-licensing-bundle-chrome-search&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;complicated legal reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da87&quot; id=&quot;da87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;According to Bryan Pon, PhD, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030859611400072X?via%3Dihub#!&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030859611400072X?via%3Dihub#!&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mobile platform researcher&lt;/a&gt; and co-founder of the data analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cariboudata.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cariboudata.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caribou Data&lt;/a&gt;, this gives Google a lot of control over its platform. “Consumers are attached to the Google products and services that sit on top of the operating system,” explains Pon. “Google has very strong proprietary control over those, and in that sense wields tremendous power, irrespective of the operating system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe56&quot; id=&quot;fe56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Additionally, Huawei, and Google’s other partners, have to include a collection of developer tools called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-services&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/play-services&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Play Services&lt;/a&gt;. These background tools let app developers easily do things like create push notifications, embed maps in their apps, or get a GPS location. Most Android apps distributed through the Google Play Store rely on some of these tools to provide features that are too expensive or difficult for every developer to build themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71f1&quot; id=&quot;71f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As Pon explains, some of these tools are crucial features that would normally be part of an operating system. “They’re actually taking functionality out of the core platform,” Pon says. “They’re leaving Android open source, more and more, just a shell. And that core functionality is now part of just proprietary Google services.” Google does this to make it easier to update important features without waiting for a big Android update, but the result consolidates Google’s power over its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4efe&quot; id=&quot;4efe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Without Google Play Services, Huawei would have to build these tools itself or leave developers to do it. The company has created its own version of some of these features — like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/hms/catalog/huaweipush_agent.html?page=hmssdk_huaweipush_introduction_agent&quot; data-href=&quot;https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/hms/catalog/huaweipush_agent.html?page=hmssdk_huaweipush_introduction_agent&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;push notification service&lt;/a&gt; — but developers still have to add support for Huawei’s version of the tools to their apps in order for them to work on non-Google phones. Huawei is building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633772/huawei-app-gallery-google-play-store-rival-trump-ban&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633772/huawei-app-gallery-google-play-store-rival-trump-ban&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its own app store alternative&lt;/a&gt;, but it could take a long time to build everything else that developers and users are accustomed to getting from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;733b&quot; id=&quot;733b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Manufacturers generally have little choice but to play by Google’s rules, because the costs of doing otherwise are tremendous. One of the few companies to opt out of Google’s system was Amazon with its series of Fire Tablets. If you buy a Fire, you’ll have something similar to an Android experience, but with hardly a trace of Google. Instead, you’ll use the Amazon Appstore. You’ll talk to Alexa instead of the Google Assistant. You’ll use Amazon’s Silk Browser instead of Chrome. Under the hood, all your apps will be using Amazon’s version of key features, like notifications or GPS. The approach works fine enough for a tablet, but when Amazon tried to make a phone, &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/3536969/amazon-fire-phone-bust/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://time.com/3536969/amazon-fire-phone-bust/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it failed miserably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d269&quot; id=&quot;d269&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Samsung tries to walk a middle ground, offering parallel versions of almost everything Google makes, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.email.provider&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; data-href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.email.provider&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;basic email apps&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its own voice assistant&lt;/a&gt;, without breaking away from its partner agreement. But if Samsung were to find itself in Huawei’s shoes, even that might not be enough. “I think to some extent, Samsung has to tell itself that it… has a plan B,” says Pon. “But I think, realistically, if they get turned off, like Huawei might get turned off, then they don’t have any good options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4438&quot; id=&quot;4438&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Under normal circumstances, this symbiotic relationship benefits everyone involved and lends credibility to Google’s claim that Android — unlike the iPhone — is “open,” while still letting the company maintain as much control over Android as possible. If a company like Amazon wants to build its own alternative from scratch, it can. For companies like Samsung and Huawei that can’t afford to or aren’t willing to go that far, they can leverage Google’s massive resources to make a variation of Android that consumers will want, without deviating too far from Google’s master plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c48&quot; id=&quot;4c48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, barring relief in the brewing China-U.S. trade war, Huawei has been forcibly pushed into going the much harder Amazon route. Huawei can’t use Google apps, it can’t support the push notifications or location services most apps use, and it even has to wait longer for security updates before it can push them to users. Existing users &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18633171/huawei-software-updates-phones-google-android-commerce-department&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;won’t be affected for now&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the temporary license granted by the U.S. Commerce Department, but future plans look grim. It took Amazon years to build its own version of Google’s services. Huawei’s CEO says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-huawei-supply-chain-software-hardware-backup-20190520-story.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-huawei-supply-chain-software-hardware-backup-20190520-story.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the company has a plan&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear how long that plan could take to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9752&quot; id=&quot;9752&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fortunately, for Huawei, it’s not all bad news. The Google Play Store has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/google-misses-out-on-billions-in-china.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/17/google-misses-out-on-billions-in-china.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned in China for years&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-great-firewall-of-china/2018/11/05/5dc0f85a-e16d-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.5c3a1a2d8ff0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-great-firewall-of-china/2018/11/05/5dc0f85a-e16d-11e8-ba30-a7ded04d8fac_story.html?utm_term=.5c3a1a2d8ff0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the country’s Great Firewall&lt;/a&gt; that censors many foreign sites and services including Google search, Facebook, or YouTube. Losing them is of little importance in the Chinese market, which makes up &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/huawei-books-8-8b-profit-for-2018/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/huawei-books-8-8b-profit-for-2018/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;52% of the company’s overall revenue&lt;/a&gt;. Outside China, on the other hand, Huawei stands to lose quite a lot. Globally, it’s hard to sell an Android phone without Google services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;32e2&quot; id=&quot;32e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fb1c&quot; id=&quot;fb1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Beyond Huawei’s problems — and beyond the reality that geopolitics will play an increasing role in the tech business — this situation reveals a truth that Google has downplayed for years. While Android — the stripped down, open-source operating system — may be available to everyone, all of the Google pieces that make most Android phones worthwhile are locked behind a partner program. Google might let almost everyone into its exclusive club, but it reserves the right to kick them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f2f9&quot; id=&quot;f2f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Even if we could assume the best about Google’s intentions to keep Android as open as possible — and Google did not respond to a request by &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; for comment — the Huawei order demonstrates that Google’s control can be abused by other entities. If the U.S. were in a trade war with South Korea instead of China, Samsung phones — still the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; in the world over — could face a similar fate. Google can reaffirm its commitment to being “open” and “free” all it wants, but ultimately it’s still a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The shittiest project I ever worked on (2013)</title>
<link>https://blog.plover.com/tech/prudential.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.plover.com/tech/prudential.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;storytitle&quot; name=&quot;prudential&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.plover.com/tech/prudential.html&quot; id=&quot;prudential&quot;&gt;The shittiest project I ever worked on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in job interviews I've been asked to describe a project I worked on that failed. This is the one I always think of first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995 I quit my regular job as senior web engineer for Time-Warner and became a consultant developing interactive content for the World-Wide Web, which was still a pretty new thing at the time. Time-Warner taught me many things. One was that many large companies are not single organizations; they are much more like a bunch of related medium-sized companies that all share a building and a steam plant. (Another was that I didn't like being part of a large company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my early clients was Prudential, which is a large life insurance, real estate, and financial services conglomerate based in Newark, New Jersey—another fine example of a large company that actually turned out to be a bunch of medium-sized companies sharing a single building. I did a number of projects for them, one of which was to produce an online directory of Prudential-affiliated real estate brokers. I'm sure everyone is familiar with this sort of thing by now. The idea was that you would visit a form on their web site, put in your zip code or town name, and it would extract the nearby brokers from a database and present them to you on a web page, ordered by distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project really sucked, partly because Prudential was disorganized and bureaucratic, and partly because I didn't know what I was doing. I quoted a flat fee for the job, assuming that it would be straightforward and that I had a good idea of what was required. But I hadn't counted on bureaucratic pettifoggery and the need for every layer of the management hierarchy to stir the soup a little. They tweaked and re-tweaked every little thing. The data set they delivered was very dirty, much of it garbled or incomplete, and they kept having to fix their exporting process, which they did incompletely, several times. They also changed their minds at least once about which affiliated real estate agencies should be in the results, and had to re-send a new data set with the new correct subset of affiliates, and then the new data would be garbled or incomplete. So I received replacement data six or seven times. This would not have been a problem, except that each time they presented me with a file in a somewhat different format, probably exported from some loser's constantly-evolving Excel spreadsheet. So I had to write seven or eight different versions of the program that validated and loaded the data. These days I would handle this easily; after the first or second iteration I would explain the situation: I had based my estimate on certain expectations of how much work would be required; I had not expected to clean up dirty data in eight different formats; they had the choice of delivering clean data in the same format as before, renegotiating the fee, or finding someone else to do the project. But in 1995 I was too green to do this, and I did the extra work for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, they tweaked the output format of the program repeatedly over weeks: first the affiliates should be listed in distance order, but no, they should be listed alphabetically if they are in the same town and then after that the ones from other towns, grouped by town; no, the Prudential Preferred affiliates must be listed first regardless of distance, which necessitated a redelivery of the data which up until then hadn't distinguished between ordinary and Preferred affiliates; no wait, that doesn't make sense, it puts a far-off Preferred affiliate ahead of a nearby regular affiliate... again, this is something that many clients do, but I wasn't expecting it and it took a lot of time I hadn't budgeted for. Also these people had, I now know, an unusually bad case of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we finally got it just right, and it had been approved by multiple layers of management and given a gold star by the Compliance Department, and my clients took it to the Prudential Real Estate people for a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may recall that Prudential is actually a bunch of medium-sized companies that share a building in Newark. The people I was working with were part of one of these medium-sized companies. The real estate business people were in a different company. The report I got about the demo was that the real estate people loved it, it was just what they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But,” they said, “how do we collect the referral fees?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Real Estate is a franchise operation. Prudential does not actually broker any real estate. Instead, a local franchisee pays a fee for the use of the name and logo and other services. One of the other services is that Prudential runs a national toll-free number; you can call this up and they will refer you to a nearby affiliate who will help you buy or sell real estate. And for each such referral, the affiliate pays Prudential a referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had put together a real estate affiliate locator application which let you locate a nearby Prudential-affiliated franchisee and contact them directly, bypassing the referral and eliminating Prudential's opportunity to collect a referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was told to make one final change to the affiliate locator. It now worked like this: The user would enter their town or zip code; the application would consult the database and find the contact information for the nearby affiliates, it would order them in the special order dictated by the Compliance Department, and then it would display a web page with the addresses and phone numbers of the affiliates carefully suppressed. Instead, the name of each affiliate would be followed by the Prudential national toll-free number AND NOTHING ELSE. Even the names were suspect. For a while Prudential considered replacing each affiliate's name with a canned string, something like &quot;Prudential Real Estate Affiliate&quot;, because what if the web user decided to look up the affiliate in the Yellow Pages and call them directly? It was eventually decided that the presence of the toll-free number directly underneath rendered this risk acceptably small, so the names stayed. But everything else was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Prudential didn't need an affiliate locator application. They needed a static HTML page that told people to call the number. All the work I had put into importing the data, into formatting the output, into displaying the realtors in precisely the right order, had been a complete waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;KEEPING SPACE CLEAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;Starlink is on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation, meeting or exceeding all regulatory and industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;animate&quot;&gt;At end of life, the satellites will utilize their on-board propulsion system to deorbit over the course of a few months. In the unlikely event the propulsion system becomes inoperable, the satellites will burn up in Earth’s atmosphere within 1-5 years, significantly less than the hundreds or thousands of years required at higher altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Crossfit Inc. suspends use of Facebook and associated properties</title>
<link>https://www.crossfit.com/battles/crossfit-suspends-facebook-instagram</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.crossfit.com/battles/crossfit-suspends-facebook-instagram</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;CrossFit is a contrarian physiological and nutrition prescription for improving fitness and health. It is contrarian because prevailing views of fitness, health, and nutrition are wrong and have unleashed a tsunami of chronic disease upon our friends, family, and communities. The voluntary CrossFit community of 15,000 affiliates and millions of individual adherents stands steadfastly and often alone against an unholy alliance of academia, government, and multinational food, beverage, and pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CrossFit, Inc. defends relentlessly the right of its affiliates, trainers, and athletes to practice CrossFit, build voluntary CrossFit associations and businesses, and speak openly and freely about the ideas and principles that animate our views of exercise, nutrition, and health. This website—and, until recently, CrossFit’s Facebook and Instagram accounts—has long catalogued CrossFit’s tireless defense of its community against overreaching governments, malicious competitors, and corrupt academic organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Facebook deleted without warning or explanation the Banting7DayMealPlan user group. The group has 1.65 million users who post testimonials and other information regarding the efficacy of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. While the site has subsequently been reinstated (also without warning or explanation), Facebook’s action should give any serious person reason to pause, especially those of us engaged in activities contrary to prevailing opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and its properties host and oversee a significant share of the marketplace of public thought. To millions of individuals and communities across the world, Facebook and its properties remain the platforms where ideas and information are exchanged. Facebook thus serves as a de facto authority over the public square, arbitrating a worldwide exchange of information as well as overseeing the security of the individuals and communities who entrust their ideas, work, and private data to this platform. This mandates a certain responsibility and assurance of good faith, transparency, and due process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CrossFit, Inc., as a voluntary user of and contributor to this marketplace, can and must remove itself from this particular manifestation of the public square when it becomes clear that such responsibilities are betrayed or reneged upon to the detriment of our community. Common decency demands that we do so, as do our convictions regarding fitness, health, and nutrition, which sit at the heart of CrossFit’s identity and prescription. To this end, all activity on CrossFit, Inc.’s Facebook and Instagram accounts was suspended as of May 22, 2019, as CrossFit investigates the circumstances pertaining to Facebook’s deletion of the Banting7DayMealPlan and other well-known public complaints about the social-media company that may adversely impact the security and privacy of our global CrossFit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These publicly sourced complaints include but are not limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook collects and aggregates user information and shares it with state and federal authorities, as well as security organizations from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook collaborates with government security agencies on massive citizen surveillance programs such as PRISM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook censors and removes user accounts based on unknown criteria and at the request of third parties including government and foreign government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook collects, aggregates, and sells user information as a matter of business. Its business model allows governments and businesses alike to use its algorithmically conjured advertising categories as sophisticated data-mining and surveillance tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook’s news feeds are censored and crafted to reflect the political leanings of Facebook’s utopian socialists while remaining vulnerable to misinformation campaigns designed to stir up violence and prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook, as a matter of business and principle, has weak intellectual property protections and is slow to close down IP theft accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook has poor security protocols and has been subject to the largest security breaches of user data in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt;  Facebook is acting in the service of food and beverage industry interests by deleting the accounts of communities that have identified the corrupted nutritional science responsible for unchecked global chronic disease. In this, it follows the practices of Wikipedia and other private platforms that host public content but retain the ability to remove or silence—without the opportunity for real debate or appeal—information and perspectives outside a narrow scope of belief or thought. In this case, the approved perspective has resulted in the deaths of millions through preventable diseases. Facebook is thus complicit in the global chronic disease crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, CrossFit, Inc. has placed Facebook and its associated properties under review and will no longer support or use Facebook’s services until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>H.264 is magic (2016)</title>
<link>https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a video compression codec standard. It is ubiquitous - internet video, Blu-ray, phones, security cameras, drones, everything. Everything uses H.264 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a remarkable piece of technology. It is the result of 30+ years of work with one single goal: To reduce the bandwidth required for transmission of full-motion video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, it is very interesting. This post will give insight into some of the details at a high level - I hope to not bore you too much with the intricacies. Also note that many of the concepts explained here apply to video compression in general, and not just H.264.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why even compress anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple uncompressed video file will contain an array of 2D buffers containing pixel data for each frame. So it's a 3D (2 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal) array of bytes. Each pixel takes 3 bytes to store - one byte each for the three primary colors (red, green and blue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1080p @ 60 Hz = 1920x1080x60x3 =&amp;gt; ~&lt;strong&gt;370 MB/sec&lt;/strong&gt; of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is next to impossible to deal with. A 50GB Blu-ray disk will only hold ~2 mins. You can't move it anywhere fast. Even SSDs have trouble dumping this straight from RAM to Disk&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. We need compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;H.264&lt;/em&gt; compression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I will answer this. But first let me show you something. Here is the Apple Homepage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/HomePage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I captured the screen of this home page and produced two files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eh. What? Those file sizes look switched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they're right. The H.264 video, 300 frames long is 175KB. A single frame of that video in PNG is 1015KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like we're storing 300 times the amount of data in the video. But the file size is a fifth. So H.264 would seem to be 1500x as efficient as PNG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this even possible? All right, what's the trick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very many tricks! H.264 uses all the tricks you can think of (and tons you can't think of). Let's go through the important ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;sheddingweight&quot;&gt;Shedding weight&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're building a car for street racing. You need to go faster. What is the first thing you do? You shed some weight. Your car weighs 3000 lbs. You throw away stuff you don't need. Those back seats? pfft. Chuck those. That subwoofer? Gone. No music for you. Air Conditioning? Yeah, ditch it. Transmission? Ye..no. Wait! We're gonna need that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You remove everything except the things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept of throwing away bits you don't need to save space is called &lt;strong&gt;lossy&lt;/strong&gt; compression. H.264 is a lossy codec - it throws away less important bits and only keeps the important bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNG is a &lt;strong&gt;lossless&lt;/strong&gt; codec. It means that nothing is thrown away. Bit for bit, the original source image can be recovered from a PNG encoded image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important bits? How does the algorithm know what bits in my frame are important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few obvious ways to trim out images. Maybe the top right quadrant is useless all the time. So maybe we can zero out those pixels and discard that quadrant. We would use only 3/4th of the space we need. ~2200 lbs now. Or maybe we can crop out a thick border around the edges of the frame, the important stuff is in the middle anyway. Yes, you could do these. But H.264 doesn't do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does H.264 actually do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.264, like other lossy image algorithms, discards detail information. Here is a close-up of the original compared with the image post-discard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/CompressedImage-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how the compressed one does not show the holes in the speaker grills in the MacBook Pro? If you don't zoom in, you would even notice the difference. The image on the right weighs in at &lt;strong&gt;7%&lt;/strong&gt; the size of the original - and we haven't even compressed the image in the traditional sense. Imagine your car weighed just 200 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7% wow! How do you discard detail information like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we need a quick math lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;informationentropy&quot;&gt;Information Entropy&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're getting to the juicy bits! Ha puns! If you took an information theory class, you might remember information entropy. Information entropy is the number of bits required to represent some information. Note that it is not simply the size of some dataset. It is minimum number of bits that must be used to represent all the information contained in a dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your dataset is the result of a single coin toss, you need 1 bit of entropy. If you have record two coin tosses, you'll need 2 bits. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have some strange coin - you've tossed it 10 times, and every time it lands on heads. How would you describe this information to someone? You wouldn't say HHHHHHHHH. You would just say &quot;10 tosses, all heads&quot; - bam! You've just compressed some data! Easy. I saved you hours of mindfuck lectures. This is obviously an oversimplification, but you've transformed some data into another shorter representation of the same information. You've reduced data &lt;strong&gt;redundancy&lt;/strong&gt;. The information entropy in this dataset has not changed - you've just converted between representations. This type of encoder is called an &lt;strong&gt;entropy encoder&lt;/strong&gt; - it's a general-purpose lossless encoder that works for any type of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;frequencydomain&quot;&gt;Frequency Domain&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand information entropy, let's move on to transformations of data. You can represent data in some fundamental units. If you use binary, you have 0 and 1. If you use hex, you have 16 characters. You can easily transform between the two systems. They are essentially equivalent. So far so good? Ok!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some imagination! Imagine you can transform any dataset that varies over space(or time) - something like the brightness value of an image, into a different coordinate space. So instead of x-y coordinates, let's say we have frequency coordinates. freqX and freqY are the axes now. This is called a &lt;strong&gt;frequency domain&lt;/strong&gt; representation. There is another mindfuck mathematical theorem&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that states that you can do this for any data and you can achieve a perfect lossless transformation as long as freqX and freqY are high enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, but what the freq are freqX and freqY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freqX and freqY are some other set of basis units. Just like when we switch from binary to hex, we have a different fundamental unit, we're switching from the familiar X-Y to freqX and freqY. Hex 'A' looks different from binary '1010'. Both mean the same thing, but &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; different. So here is what our image looks like in the frequency domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/BasicFFT-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine grill on that MacBook pro has a high information content in the higher frequency components of that image. Finely varying content = high frequency components. Any sort of gradual variation in the color and brightness - such as gradients are low frequency components of that image. Anything in between falls in between. So fine details = high freq. Gentle gradients = low freq. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the frequency domain representation, the low frequency components are near the center of that image. The higher frequency components are towards of the edges of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Kinda makes sense. But why do all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because now, you can take that frequency domain image and then mask out the edges - discard information which will contain the information with high frequency components. Now if you convert back to your regular x-y coordinates, you'll find that the resulting image looks similar to the original but has lost some of the fine details. But now, the image only occupies a fraction of the space. By controlling how big your mask is, you can now tune precisely how detailed you want your output images to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the close-up of the laptop in the home page again. Except now, there is a circular border mask that's been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/QuantizationHorizontalWithMasks-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers represent the information entropy of that image as a fraction of the original. Even at 2%, you won't notice the difference unless you're at this zoom level. 2%! - your car now weighs 60 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's how you shed weight. This process in lossy compression is called &lt;strong&gt;quantization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Impressive, I guess. What else you got?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;chromasubsampling&quot;&gt;Chroma Subsampling.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human/eye brain system is not very good at resolving finer details in color. It can detect minor variations in brightness very easily but not color. So there must be some way to discard color information to shed even more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a TV signal, R+G+B color data gets transformed to Y+Cb+Cr. The Y is the luminance (essentially black and white brightness) and the Cb and Cr are the chrominance (color) components. RGB and YCbCr are equivalent in terms of information entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why unnecessarily complicate? RGB not good enough for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back before we had color TV, we only had the Y signal. And when color TVs just started coming along, engineers had to figure out a way to transmit RGB color along with Y. Instead of using two separate data streams, they wisely decided to encode the color information into Cb and Cr and transmit that along with the Y information. That way, BW TVs would only look at the Y component. Color TVs will, in addition, look at the chrominance components and convert to RGB internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But check out the trick: the Y component gets encoded at full resolution. The C components only at a quarter resolution. Since the eye/brain is terrible at detecting color variations, you can get away with this. By doing this, you reduce total bandwidth by one half, with very little visual difference. Half! Your car now weighs 30 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of discarding some of the color information is called &lt;strong&gt;Chroma Subsampling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While not specific to H.264 and has been around for decades itself, it is used almost universally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the big weight shedders for lossy compression. Our frames are now tiny - since we discarded most of the detail information and half of the color information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. That's it? Can we do something more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Weight shedding is only the first step. So far we're only looking at the spatial domains within a single frame. Now it's time to explore temporal compression - where we look at a group of frames across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;motioncompensation&quot;&gt;Motion compensation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a motion compensation compression standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motion compensation? What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're watching a tennis match. The camera is fixed at a certain angle. The only thing moving is the ball back and forth. How would you encode this information? You do what you always do, right? You have a 3D array of pixels, two dimensions in space and one in time. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah. Why would you? Most of the image is the same anyway. The court, the net, the crowds, all are static. The only real action is the ball moving. What if you could just have one static image of everything in the background, and then one moving image of just the ball? Wouldn't that save a lot of space? You see where I am going with this? Get it? See where I am going? Motion estimation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lame jokes aside, this is exactly what H.264 does. H.264 splits up the image into macro-blocks - typically 16x16 pixel blocks that it will use for motion estimation. It encodes one static image - typically called an &lt;strong&gt;I-frame&lt;/strong&gt;(Intra frame). This is a full frame - containing all the bits it required to construct that frame. And then subsequent frames are either &lt;strong&gt;P-frames&lt;/strong&gt;(predicted) or &lt;strong&gt;B-frames&lt;/strong&gt;(bi-directionally predicted). P-frames are frames that will encode a motion vector for each of the macro-blocks from the previous frame. So a P-frame has to be constructed by the decoder based on previous frames. It starts with the last I-frame in the video stream and then walks through every subsequent frame - adding up the motion vector deltas as it goes along until it arrives at the current frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B-frames are even more interesting, where the prediction happens bi-directionally, both from past frames and from future frames. So you can imagine now why that Apple home page video is so well compressed. Because it's really just three I-frames in which the macro blocks are being panned around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you've been playing a video on YouTube. You missed the last few seconds of dialog, so you scrub back a few seconds. Have you noticed that it doesn't instantly start playing from that timecode you just selected. It pauses for a few moments and then plays. It's already buffered those frames from the network, since you just played it, so why that pause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah that annoys the shit out of me. Why does it do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you've asked the decoder to jump to some arbitrary frame, the decoder has to redo all the calculations - starting from the nearest I-frames and adding up the motion vector deltas to the frame you're on - and this is computationally expensive, and hence the brief pause. Hopefully you'll be less annoyed now, knowing it's actually doing hard work and not just sitting around just to annoy you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you're only encoding motion vectors deltas, this technique is extremely space-efficient for any video with motion, at the cost of some computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we've covered both spatial and temporal compression! So far we have a shitton of space saved in Quantization. Chroma subsampling further halved the space required. On top of that, we have motion compensation that stores only 3 actual frames for the ~300 that we had in that video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty good to me. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we wrap up and seal the deal. We use a traditional lossless entropy encoder. Because why not? Let's just slap that on there for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;entropycoder&quot;&gt;Entropy Coder&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I-frames, after the lossy steps, contain redundant information. The motion vectors for each of the macro blocks in the P and B-frames - there are entire groups of them with the same values - since several macro blocks move by the same amount when the image pans in our test video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entropy encoder will take care of this redundancy. And since it is a general purpose lossless encoder, we don't have to worry about what tradeoffs it's making. We can recover all the data that goes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we're done! At the core of it, this is how video compression codecs like H.264 work. These are its tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok great! But I am curious to know how much our car weighs now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original video was captured at an odd resolution of 1232x1154. If we apply the math here, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 secs @ 60 fps = 1232x1154x60x3x5 =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;1.2 GB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compressed video =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;175 KB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we apply the same ratio to our 3000 lb car, we get &lt;strong&gt;0.4 lbs&lt;/strong&gt; as the final weight. 6.5 ounces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. It's magic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I am massively oversimplifying several decades of intense research in this field. If you want to know more, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Page&lt;/a&gt; is pretty descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;

Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12871403&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HackerNews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5b31gt/h264_is_magic/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for voicing your opinion!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox brings smooth video playback with the fastest AV1 decoder</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/firefox-brings-you-smooth-video-playback-with-the-worlds-fastest-av1-decoder/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/05/21/latest-firefox-release-is-faster-than-ever/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;release of Firefox 67&lt;/a&gt; brought a number of performance enhancing features that make this our fastest browser ever.  Among these is the high performance, royalty free AV1 video decoder &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;dav1d&lt;/a&gt;, now enabled by default on all desktop platforms (Windows, OSX and Linux) for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With files more than 30% smaller than today’s most popular web codec VP9 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/video-engineering/av1-beats-x264-and-libvpx-vp9-in-practical-use-case/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;], and nearly 50% smaller than its widely deployed predecessor H.264 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/hevc_2018/pdf/MSU_HEVC_AV1_comparison_2018_P4_HQ_encoders.pdf&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], AV1 allows high-quality video experiences with a lot less network usage, and has the potential to transform how and where we watch video on the Internet. However, because AV1 is brand new and more sophisticated, some experts had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multichannel.com/news/hardware-support-big-step-ahead-av1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that market adoption would wait until 2020 when high-performance hardware decoders are expected.  Dav1d in the browser upends these predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aomedia.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alliance for Open Media&lt;/a&gt;, dav1d is a joint effort between the French non-profit VideoLAN and the greater FFmpeg open source audio/video community.  Some of the leading minds in open source multimedia joined forces to release the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2018/First-release-of-dav1d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; version of dav1d last fall, already 2x to 5x faster than &lt;a href=&quot;https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/&quot;&gt;libaom&lt;/a&gt;, the reference decoder published by AOMedia as part of the AV1 standards effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33514&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-500x267.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; height=&quot;518&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-500x267.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-250x134.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then the dav1d developers have squeezed out even more performance by profiling and rewriting critical sections in highly-parallelized SIMD assembly. And this shows in the benchmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33521&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-500x268.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;694&quot; height=&quot;372&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-500x268.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-250x134.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher performance and greater efficiency means smooth playback of AV1 video in the browser with significantly less CPU utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AV1 already seeing adoption on the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing dav1d in Firefox could not have happened at a better time.  In just the past few months we’ve seen remarkable growth in the use of AV1, with our latest figures showing that 11.8% of video playback in Firefox Beta used AV1, up from 3% in March and 0.85% in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33518&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-500x310.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;987&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-500x310.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-250x155.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-768x476.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that desktop Firefox contains dav1d, we expect even more websites will take advantage of this next-generation, royalty-free video codec AV1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mozilla investing in the AV1 future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art decoders like dav1d are great for video playback, but best-in-class, free and open source software &lt;em&gt;en&lt;/em&gt;coders are equally important to a healthy AV1 community.  The AOMedia reference encoder was developed with the goal of creating the AV1 standard, not a production encoder.  Thus, Mozilla and Xiph.Org are jointly developing a clean-room encoder named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xiph/rav1e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rav1e&lt;/a&gt; (the Rust AV1 Encoder) to increase encoding gains over the reference encoder and allow software encoding fast enough for real-time applications like WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good encoders make heavy use of psychovisual models to allocate bits for what humans perceive as good visual quality (not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PSNR&lt;/a&gt;).  With rav1e we are applying the perceptual analysis expertise from our earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.xiph.org/index.php?title=Daala&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Daala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Theora&lt;/a&gt; codec development efforts to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/pvq_demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;activity masking&lt;/a&gt;, better &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/barrbrain/9d541d809d1d664460b5ce5c00a57948/Chroma%20quantizer%20balance.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;color balancing&lt;/a&gt;, improved &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/theora/demo8.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rate control&lt;/a&gt; and perceptual distortion metrics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/demo2.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CDEF&lt;/a&gt; that bring new, improved quality to AV1 encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also investing considerable research to improve encoder speed, optimizing new techniques that appear for the first time in AV1.  It’s not enough to rewrite existing code from the initial reference encoder in SIMD assembly and make it four times faster. Rav1e is developing ways to make AV1 encoding tools 1000x faster by finding new algorithms rather than simply optimizing existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rav1e is getting better all the time.  Active development continues at a rapid pace, landing major new improvements weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
