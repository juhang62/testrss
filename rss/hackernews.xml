&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/win98filepicker.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/win98filepicker.png&quot; class=&quot;fit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The file picker Windows 98.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A frame story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three toilets in my house. There are two upstairs; one in the bathroom and another in the ensuite shower room of the master bedroom. There is one downstairs; a toilet room by the front door. The two toilets upstairs do not work, they are blocked. This has been the case for over a year now. Just about everytime those toilets are used, they need to be plunged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a genius workaround. I just use the downstairs toilet now. The downstairs toilet isn’t blocked, you see. What this allows me to do is be able to take doo-doo-craps and such into something that’s not a massive vase of sewage water. Sure, I need to go downstairs in the middle of the night, but it’s a no-brainer compromise. I do not use toilets that are disrespectful to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m having trouble explaining this workaround to my family. They are so used to using the two upstairs toilets that they can scarcely imagine altering their habits. I am the only person in the house who uses the downstairs toilet. I’m not mad at them or anything, I quite like having a toilet all to myself. But it’s curious. Such creatures of habit they are, that they’ve fatalistically resigned to always resorting to that nasty carrier bag that holds the plunger, a now longtime permanant fixture of the bathroom. They routinely plunge the toilet daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in the UK, a country where people spend far more time evading work than actually doing any. &lt;q&gt;Can’t do&lt;/q&gt; is our work ethic.&lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome-has-no-thumbnails-in-the-file-picker.html#w&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I called Dyno-Rod drainage service to fix the toilet issue, but they said it’s a plumbing problem with the durgo valve. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; referred me to sister service Dyno plumbing, who in turn said the other guy was talking nonsense—there is no durgo valve—and it’s a drainage problem. Twice in a row did these so-called professionals turn up to a problem just to stare at it before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toilets remain blocked. I guess it’s much easier to accept mediocrity than to pursue adequacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;GNOME has no thumbnails in the file picker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file picker is the pop-up box thingy that appears when you’re opening a file, usually when uploading something online. The GNOME desktop environment uses the file picker package GtkFileChooser. This file picker does not have a thumbnail view. It is broken software. Thumbnails are not a cute little extra, they are essential. This is as bad as a file picker that doesn’t list the name of the files, only their creation date, or inode serial number. It is broken software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gtk.png&quot; class=&quot;fit&quot;/&gt; No, individual file previews aren’t &lt;q&gt;thumbnails.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use GNOME and this is a revelation to you, it’s because you’re used to mediocrity. If you think your experience all this time was &lt;q&gt;normal,&lt;/q&gt; you’re completely mistaken—and it’s not least because you’re using a specific desktop environment that’s available only on Free operating systems that account for only a fraction of a percent of desktop computer usage anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to give a family member tech support, and when you watch what they are trying to do, you notice they are dismissing an important dialogue box without reading what it says, which is otherwise preventing what they’re trying to do. How silly of them! Let’s flip things around. Imagine these sorts of honest computer novices watch you use GNOME. Imagine how silly you look to the 99% of the population who uses a functioning file picker. I promise it looks just as maddening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A file picker has one job, and it’s to be able to search and pick a file. I am unable to find pictures with it. Arguing about this is like arguing with my sister that no, the toilets aren't fine, it fails at its basic job. I am unable to completely convey how infuriating it is that people think this is &lt;q&gt;fine&lt;/q&gt;, this is &lt;q&gt;normal&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bug report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug was first logged near the beginning of this century (&lt;time&gt;April 2004&lt;/time&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome-has-no-thumbnails-in-the-file-picker.html#gl&quot;&gt;gl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome-has-no-thumbnails-in-the-file-picker.html#bz&quot;&gt;bz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/bug.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/bug.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The bug report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file-chooser should be able to share the &lt;q&gt;icon view&lt;/q&gt; feature used in Nautilus, so that you can choose between list view and icon view (with thumbnails). I believe the Windows file selector already does this. Now how to do this I have no clue about, because I am not a developer. I guess either Nautilus should allow other applications to share this function (which could also be useful to file-roller e.g.), or it should be lifted out from Nautilus, making it a gtk widget or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bug has received over one hundred comments over the course of nearly two decades. The total amount of time that generations of developers have collectively wasted writing out these comments have probably exceeded the amount of time it would’ve taken to fix the issue. The amount of written discussion on this issue is &lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/wario.png&quot;&gt;greater than 10,000 words, and now locked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gtk4 doesn’t fix this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this tweet on Mastadon about how there is an operating system called GNOME OS. The entire operating system is GNOME, &lt;em&gt;shudder&lt;/em&gt;. Tongue-in-cheek, I asked &lt;q&gt;do the file pickers have thumbnails.&lt;/q&gt; It was meant to be rhetorical, of course it doesn’t have thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome1.png&quot; class=&quot;fit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Don’t take this personally Xerz, I love you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome2.png&quot; class=&quot;fit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It’s still only in list view, this is somehow worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s that. But oh wait, this bug might be fixed as part of GTK4—a new version of the toolkit that implements the GTK components, which possibly means a functioning version of GtkFileChooser&amp;amp;mldr; Possibly&amp;amp;mldr;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jayfax.neocities.org/mediocrity/gnome3.png&quot; class=&quot;fit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ahahahahahhaha&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the point of doing a whole upgrade of the GTK toolkit while ignoring this problem? This is like completely redoing a bathroom but forgetting to fix the blocked toilet (which my sister once unironically suggested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the weirdest thing to me. First of all, how do developers so casually ignore this issue? Second of all, how do users so casually ignore this issue? If you’re confused as why my family and professionals casually ignore two blocked toilets, then you should know how confused I am about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Free desktop operating systems are a joke and haven’t been popularly adopted. It’s little things like this that add up. Why was there a Windows monopoly? I think it’s a stretch to just blame it on OEM bundling. No, it’s legit because there isn’t anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, this bug isn’t specific to GNOME. LXDE and Mint also use GtkFileChooser. I use LXDE, I still haven’t figured out a way to replace the file chooser with the KDE file picker, which does have thumbnails. Maybe I need to fully install and use all of KDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may say, &lt;q&gt;quit complaining, the GNOME developers are doing for free!&lt;/q&gt; Okay. Well, how much money should I pay for someone to fix this then? I’m legit offering a bounty here. Conditions are that this fix makes it into the master branch. It stands though that KDE seemed to have this feature working for ages, and they’re doing it for free too. Also, operating systems from the olden times also had it too—Windows 98, as you see at the top of this HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might also say &lt;q&gt;Just use KDE!&lt;/q&gt; Yeah, I guess I could use KDE, just like I use the downstairs toilet instead of the other ones. Maybe I’m being like my sister here, whose excuse to not using the downstairs toilet is that its &lt;q&gt;too small.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GtkFileChooser remains broken. I guess it’s much easier to accept mediocrity than to pursue adequacy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The M1 MacBook Air is the best computer I&amp;#039;ve ever owned</title>
<link>https://bou.ke/blog/macbouk-air/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bou.ke/blog/macbouk-air/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Jan 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a new job recently so I had the opportunity to get one of the new M1 MacBooks, I decided to go with the Air. The reviews have been very positive and I’m here to tell you: it is indeed an amazing device. The performance feels a lot better than my MacBook Pro 16”, which is only a year old and about 3x the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got the Mac I set out with the goal of avoiding Intel builds of software as much as possible and using native whenever possible unless it’s absolutely impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nix&quot;&gt;Nix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bouk/b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;whole system configuration&lt;/a&gt; stored in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bou.ke/blog/nix/&quot;&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;, which was the thing that I least expected to work and arm64 support is still a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/95903&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work in progress&lt;/a&gt;. I could install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt; build of Nix and run it under Rosetta but wanted to avoid that, so I went back to my old pal;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;homebrew&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the first things I installed and got working, when I did it I had to install it into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/opt/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; manually and install everything with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--source&lt;/code&gt; flag but… everything mostly worked? Lots of props to the Homebrew team for getting everything running so quickly, with some amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open-source project management&lt;/a&gt; the community worked together very quickly to support most of the software that Homebrew offers. There’s still some software that doesn’t work—notably neovim. But I’m sure that will be fixed soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installer now installs into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/opt/homebrew&lt;/code&gt; by default and there’s prebuilt bottles of most packages, so the Homebrew experience is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;go&quot;&gt;Go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my work involves Go, and I depend on a lot of tools written in Go. I was happy to see that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/ports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go team was on top of it&lt;/a&gt; and released the 1.16 beta quite quickly, which is what is installed right now when you do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install go&lt;/code&gt;. I’ve had no issues with it and am enjoying some of the new features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41191&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;file embedding&lt;/a&gt;. GoLand was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2020/12/30/goland-2020-3-1-is-out/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; to support M1 pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;terraform&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform I had the most issues with since using it depends on a bunch of plugins, which are generally only available for x86_64. This won’t change until Go 1.16 has been released. So here I had to resort to building for x86_64, which is easy to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -L 'https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/archive/v0.14.4.tar.gz' | tar -xzf-
cd terraform-0.14.4/
GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ~/bin/terraform
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now Terraform will just use plugin built for Intel. I assume that most Terraform plugins will support arm64 very quickly after Go 1.16 is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-and-universal-binaries&quot;&gt;Rust and Universal Binaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alacritty&lt;/a&gt; as my terminal. It supported &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arm64&lt;/code&gt; pretty quickly but the current build for it doesn’t include it, so I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/4683&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made a PR&lt;/a&gt; that will build a universal binary. Creating a universal binary for Rust is quite easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo build &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--release&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--release&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;aarch64-apple-darwin
lipo target/&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;x86_64,aarch64&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-apple-darwin&lt;/span&gt;/release/alacritty &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-output&lt;/span&gt; alacritty
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;file alacritty&lt;/code&gt; will now show you something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;alacritty: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64]
alacritty (for architecture x86_64):    Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
alacritty (for architecture arm64):     Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can run it in either &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt; mode with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arch -x86_64 alacritty&lt;/code&gt; or natively with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arch -arm64 alacritty&lt;/code&gt; and the OS will automatically select the right binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a universal binary for a Go application is similarly easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app_amd64 main.go
GOARCH=arm64 go build -o app_arm64 main.go
lipo app_{amd64,arm64} -create -output app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;windows-and-games&quot;&gt;Windows and Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; I’ve been playing for a long time that I still need on any computer I get, but they’re 32-bit Windows-only. This was something that was surprisingly easy to get working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parallels Technical Preview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for Windows Insider and download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows 10 on ARM Insider Preview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install it into Parallels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can download Steam and basically install anything and it will probably work. Microsoft really did some amazing magic in getting both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 programs running on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arm64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow Apple has created the best PC in every category at once. It is even the best Windows PC, despite the multiple layers of emulation that are happening. The battery life is incredible, I haven’t experienced any slowdowns, I don’t hear any fans spin up (because there are none). It’s hard not to be excited about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple chose to go down this path, they could dominate the server space if they took their magic chips, put it in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rack unit&lt;/a&gt; and made it easy to install Linux onto it. Intel is completely screwed unless they come up with something better, fast.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Silicon Valley gets about engineers that traditional companies do not</title>
<link>https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've worked at various tech companies: from &quot;traditional&quot; shops and consultancies, through an investment bank, to high-growth tech firms. I've also talked with software engineers working at startups, banking, automotive, big tech, and more &quot;traditional&quot; companies. This mix had a healthy sample of Silicon-Valley companies and ones headquartered outside this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I've noticed that Silicon Valley companies consistently &quot;get&quot; a few things that their traditional counterparts fail to either understand or implement in practice&lt;/strong&gt; - especially in Europe. These are practices that result in faster innovation at a company-level, better professional growth for engineers, and just better &quot;utilization&quot;, for the better word for it. In turn, Silicon Valley companies can (and do!) pay higher wages, and they get more value out of the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll use the term &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Silicon Valley-like company&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; to refer to modern companies who create high leverage with each software engineering hire, and who have traditionally been headquartered in Silicon Valley - though many newer ones no longer got started there. They are the kind of companies that are comparable in working output per engineer to the likes of Facebook or Google. They use similar methodologies and can often attract talent from other &quot;Silicon Valley-like&quot; companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the key things these companies &quot;get&quot; better than many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-autonomy-for-software-engineers&quot;&gt;1. Autonomy for software engineers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &quot;traditional&quot; companies, developers get work items assigned to them - most often JIRA tickets. These tickets are vetted by the product - or project - manager, and they have most key details to do the work. And they're expected to do just that. There's little need for questions unless it's about clarifying a detail in the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join a &quot;SV-like&quot; company, and you'll see little of this. There are projects, and there are program managers and engineering managers. But for the most part, engineers are expected (and encouraged!) to figure out the &quot;how&quot; of the work, including making larger decisions. In some places, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-to-lead-a-project-in-software-development/&quot;&gt;each project would have an engineer leading it&lt;/a&gt;, who facilitates breaking up the work. At other places, engineering managers or senior engineers could do this work. Regardless of how it's done, all engineers are incentivized to look at the big picture, to unblock themselves, and to solve any problem they see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers taking initiative is something &quot;SV-like&quot; companies celebrate. It's common to see services and features built that engineers suggested or have teams spend dedicated time paying off tech debt that people on the team advocated for. And it is uncommon for managers to tell engineers what exactly to do, to break down their work into small chunks or to micromanage them. People self manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The expectation from developers at traditional companies is to complete assigned work. At SV-like companies, it's to solve problems that the business has.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference. It impacts the day-to-day life of any engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At traditional companies, the notion of devs do what they are told often ends up with a hierarchical setup. I've talked with people at a bank that had six levels of project management. Developers were at the bottom two. Decisions were allowed to be done from level three. Basically, those doing the work did not have a say - by design. Need I add that this bank was struggling with how their software department was (not) working?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.20.59.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.20.59.png 600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.20.59.png 1000w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.20.59.png 1082w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;A hierarchical view of the world. Some traditional companies still work like this.
&lt;p&gt;Compare this with places where engineers are recognized to have the ability to solve problems on the ground better than anyone else. Leaders know that it's in the best interest of the business to share all relevant business context with them, and give space for execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.24.41.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.24.41.png 600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.24.41.png 1000w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-15.24.41.png 1558w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;Passing context down and giving autonomy to make decisions is how efficient organizations pull ahead.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-curious-problem-solvers-not-mindless-resources&quot;&gt;2. Curious problem solvers, not mindless resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional companies tend to think of an engineer's time of 8 hours to spend on coding. Any time that is not in front of a computer, and doing coding, is often thought of as waste. And they justify this with the high cost. I've heard someone describe the reasoning like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineers get paid more than many other functions. We need to utilize them accordingly. We can't have them run empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;SV-like&quot; companies think of software engineers as the people best suited to solve the problems that the organization has. They hire not only for technical skills but communication and problem-solving ability. Their thinking is a bit more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineers are among the highest-paid people in our company. This is because they can bring some of the highest leverage through coding and problem solving. We want to expose them to the business, so while they are doing their &quot;normal&quot; work, they can also find more impactful opportunities for the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In practice, a motivated engineer easily makes multiple times the impact of a &quot;factory worker&quot; who is just told what to do.&lt;/strong&gt; In the worst case, when the work spec is are clear and correct, both people have the same output. However, engineers who are encouraged to solve problems will often stop and think before picking up work, identifying opportunities for more impact. Here's a couple of conversations I've had at &quot;SV-like&quot; companies after asking an engineer if they can do X:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;I did a bit of digging, and though we could do X, if we can reduce the scope by this feature that won't make a difference for the business impact, &lt;strong&gt;we could ship this without any code changes&lt;/strong&gt;, just changing a few config files.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;I am concerned if we could ship the project, and think we should put a pause on it&lt;/strong&gt;. I checked what our competitors are doing, and one of them launched a similar feature, but reversed it, after they got investigated by the regulator. Have we checked with the legal team if we could ship this at all?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;I looked at our backlog, and project Y is really similar. &lt;strong&gt;If we combined project X and project Y, we could ship two things&lt;/strong&gt;, with very little overhead.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;We could either build this project on the legacy infrastructure now, but then we have migrate to the new infra that will be complete in a month. &lt;strong&gt;Can we delay the project by a month&lt;/strong&gt;, until the new infra is ready, to avoid double work? If there's no strong business reason to launch in a month, I'd really suggest we do this&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an environment that encourages problem solving and results over following directions, better decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-internal-data-code-and-documentation-transparency&quot;&gt;3. Internal data, code, and documentation transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency is big at SV companies. Though there are exceptions - Apple or Palantir supposedly taking great care to give as little information to engineers as needed - I've observed most &quot;SV-like&quot; companies sharing as much as they can. They do this in a way that is in line with GDPR, PII, and other regulations that apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employees - not just engineers - often have access to realtime business metrics&lt;/strong&gt;, and data sources to write their own queries and create custom reports. At Skyscanner, we would get a daily summary email on the daily revenue breakdown, every day. At Uber, there would be a weekly growth newsletter with similar metrics, weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As companies grow and as they go public, a consolidation of this information happens. Still, engineers still have access to business data for their organization that helps guide their decision making.&lt;br/&gt;At traditional companies, much of this does not exist. Engineers get the spec, and the higher ups will know why something is decided - at least, that's the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-exposure-to-the-business-and-to-business-metrics&quot;&gt;4. Exposure to the business and to business metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At SV companies, it's expected that each team member understands what part of the business their work impacts and how. The team goals are rarely just to ship a feature: it's to decrease customer churn by 2% by launching Feature1, or to increase revenue by a predicted $10M/year by shipping ProjectX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SV engineers are encouraged to interact with the rest of the business&lt;/strong&gt; and build relationships outside just fellow engineers. In practice, more senior engineers usually end up doing this: from having 1:1s with product managers to taking part in customer research sessions. But I've seen new joiner engineers work directly with business stakeholders without anyone blinking an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In contrast, traditional companies often make it impossible for developers to interact with the rest of the business&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not how it's presented, though. They'll say &quot;we want to shield our engineers from distraction&quot;. But I've heard stories of an engineering manager wanting to invite team members to a product presentation, and the product manager shutting this idea down. &quot;We need them to work, and we can't afford to be distracted.&quot; is a common excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an engineer at a traditional company builds relationships outside their team, they'll often get told they are &quot;not focusing enough&quot;, &quot;wasting time&quot; or doing things that is &quot;not their business&quot;. This kind of &quot;unusual&quot; activity would often be recorded as a negative in their performance review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds crazy to me that companies would take some of their best-positioned problem solvers, and force them into the &quot;you just write code&quot; box, but it's happening. And the same companies who try to measure engineering productivity with metrics related to lines of code or commits wonder &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/&quot;&gt;why their engineers are not product-focused or product-aware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-engineer-to-engineer-comms-over-triangle-communication&quot;&gt;5. Engineer-to-engineer comms over triangle-communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're an engineer and have a question about how another team does something, you go about it differently at traditional, and at &quot;SV-like&quot; companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional companies will encourage hierarchical communication.&lt;/strong&gt; This is both to &quot;shield&quot; engineers, and also because managers in these places prefer to be information hubs, and not give up control over this part. Here's how a question or ask to another team would often go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-09.54.00-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-09.54.00-1.png 600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-09.54.00-1.png 1000w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-09.54.00-1.png 1600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-09.54.00-1.png 1888w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;Communicating in a &quot;traditional&quot; / hierarchical organization
&lt;p&gt;&quot;SV-like&quot; companies encourage engineer-to-engineer communication, cutting out middlemen. This is faster in all cases. And in cases where the engineer on the other team cannot help, this process can fall back to the &quot;traditional&quot; model of the manager helping out facilitating the discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-16-at-15.47.11.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-16-at-15.47.11.png 600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-16-at-15.47.11.png 1000w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-16-at-15.47.11.png 1600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-16-at-15.47.11.png 1810w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;Communicating done (far more) efficiently
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-investing-in-a-less-frustrating-developer-experience&quot;&gt;6. Investing in a less frustrating developer experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing in 2020 can be frustrating. Not because of writing code - that's the easy part! - but the surrounding things. Setting up dependencies. Deploying to production or test environments. CI/CD. Monitoring and alerting. These are not that big of a deal while you're on a team of a few people. Still, they'll come up every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, the developer experience becomes much more frustrating as the company grows&lt;/strong&gt;. It starts with smaller things like the build time getting slower, dependencies adding up, or changes that need to be made across services. It continues with figuring out which team owns which service, small migrations blowing up by impacting many teams, all the way to redefining the architecture across all of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frameworks and tooling change quickly, and the tooling rarely keeps up. Companies that care about engineers focusing on solving problems quickly set up various infra, platform and SRE teams, who reduce the developer experience churn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it might sound counter-intuitive to hire software engineers who only focus on other software engineers working faster: at many places, it's not. It's a great return that helps these companies move faster, and developers stay happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This also happens to be an area I'm quite interested in, and where &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/now/#exploring-startup-ideas&quot;&gt;I'm validating some startup ideas&lt;/a&gt; - if you have thoughts on this space, hit me up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-higher-leverage-higher-autonomy-pay-&quot;&gt;7. Higher leverage --&amp;gt; higher {autonomy, pay}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any SV-like company who wants to compete in pay for engineers needs to create high leverage where the value brought in by these engineers exceed their salaries. This leverage can come both at scale, and at growing the business. Reducing time wasted on things like unnecessary comms, and tooling all add to this leverage. Giving enough autonomy for engineers to (over) contribute to the business is how you can keep this leverage high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What much of Google, Facebook and other established companies are paying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.levels.fyi/comp.html?track=Software%20Engineer&amp;amp;search=google%20l5&quot;&gt;high salaries today&lt;/a&gt;, is the leverage of scale. An engineer at one of these companies often builds features used by many millions of customers. This kind of leverage and value-add pays for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-16.29.33-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-16.29.33-1.png 600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-16.29.33-1.png 1000w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-16.29.33-1.png 1600w, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-20-at-16.29.33-1.png 2400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 720px) 720px&quot;/&gt;Higher autonomy --&amp;gt; higher leverage --&amp;gt; higher value created --&amp;gt; higher pay (all while the company still makes a profit)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What SV-like startups do is leverage software engineers in growing the business&lt;/strong&gt;. This is how a software engineer at Fog Creek software &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/20090101/how-hard-could-it-be-thanks-or-no-thanks.html&quot;&gt;implemented a million-dollar idea for ad classfields&lt;/a&gt;. It's how a few engineers and designers pushed ahead &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2015/10/cursed-project-short-history-facebook-button&quot;&gt;to build the Like button at Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The business impact of this button is well in the billions: allowing Facebook to (re-) target ads, and &quot;track&quot; users outside of the Facebook site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had any of the people mentioned above worked at a &quot;traditional&quot; environment, their ideas would have stayed exactly that: ideas. &quot;SV-like&quot; startups incentivize engineers to come forward with business ideas, and implement them, while they are are at it. Everyone is better off for it: the people with the idea and the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that leverage engineers well will have no trouble paying close to the top of the market, or above it. Basecamp &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-pay-people-at-basecamp/&quot;&gt;is a good example&lt;/a&gt; of non-&quot;Big tech&quot; company that leverages engineers well, meaning they can also pay top of the SF market for base salary, globally, while staying profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biggest-overall-difference&quot;&gt;The biggest overall difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of aspects to differences in how different type of companies approach their relationship to engineers. The biggest one is this, though. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;SV-like&quot; companies think of engineers as value generators, and creative problem solvers. Traditional companies think of them as factory workers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This divide in thinking is what leads to forward-thinking companies being able to both pay engineers better, while giving them more autonomy. A factory worker has a very well-defined added value, that you can plan for. A creative problem solver, on the other hand, can bring in 10x that value, when utilized properly. It makes sense to pay them more, give them more freedom, and as this is how you enable them to contribute more value business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've worked in a SV-like environment, you also struggle to go back to the &quot;traditional&quot; workplace, where everyone has their well-defined role, and eyebrows are raised when you step out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software engineer, pleasant places to work at is where you are a problem solver, not a factory worker. Which one are you today?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chemisty of Cast-Iron Seasoning: A Science-Based How-To (2010)</title>
<link>http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The post after this one on “black rust” describes why you should heat the pan before applying oil for seasoning. This helps the seasoning to adhere and makes the pan pleasantly black.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/02/black-rust-and-cast-iron-seasoning/&quot;&gt;http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/02/black-rust-and-cast-iron-seasoning/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/perfect-popovers-and-how-to-clean-reseason-cast-iron/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I illustrated how I cleaned and reseasoned an antique cast iron popover pan. This was my first attempt, and my seasoning technique was somewhat haphazard because I couldn’t find consistent, science-based advice. I used a combination of organic avocado oil and strained drippings from organic bacon. This worked pretty well on the popover pan, which doesn’t have a polished surface. But the smooth inner surface of a skillet showed an unevenness of color and texture, and the seasoning wasn’t hard enough. It was too easily marred by cooking utensils or scraping against oven racks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to understand the chemistry behind seasoning so I’d know how to fix this, but there is nothing that addresses this issue directly. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richsoil.com/cast-iron.jsp&quot;&gt;Web page on cast iron&lt;/a&gt; posted by someone similarly obsessed with the science gave me two crucial clues, the phrases “polymerized fat” and “drying oil”. From there I was able to find the relevant scientific literature and put the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures below are both of the same antique cast iron skillet. The “before” close-up on the left is from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/recipe-for-cast-iron-german-pancake-with-apples/&quot;&gt;picture of the skillet in my previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; on making German Pancakes. I stripped the pan with oven cleaner and reseasoned it based on my new understanding. The “after” close-up on the right shows the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GriswoldSkillet7_closeups.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Griswold skillet closeups: old seasoning on left, new seasoning on right&quot; title=&quot;Griswold skillet closeups: old seasoning on left, new seasoning on right&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;325&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-708&quot;/&gt;Griswold skillet closeups: old seasoning on left, new seasoning on right

&lt;h3&gt;Start With the Right Oil (It’s Not What You Think)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read dozens of Web pages on how to season cast iron, and there is no consensus in the advice. Some say vegetable oils leave a sticky surface and to only use lard. Some say animal fat gives a surface that is too soft and to only use vegetable oils. Some say corn oil is the only fat to use, or Crisco, or olive oil. Some recommend bacon drippings since lard is no longer readily available. Some say you must use a saturated fat – that is, a fat that is solid at room temperature, whether it’s animal or vegetable (palm oil, coconut oil, Crisco, lard). Some say never use butter. Some say butter is fine. Some swear by Pam (spray-on canola oil with additives). Some say the additives in Pam leave a residue at high temperatures and pure canola oil is best. Some say it doesn’t matter what oil you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are all wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter what oil you use, and the oil that gives the best results is not in this list. So what is it? Here are some hints: What oil do artists mix with pigment for a high quality oil paint that dries hard and glassy on the canvas? What oil is commonly used by woodturners to give their sculptures a protective, soft-sheen finish? It’s the same oil. Now what is the food-grade equivalent of this oil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil used by artists and woodturners is linseed oil. The food-grade equivalent is called flaxseed oil. This oil is ideal for seasoning cast iron for the same reason it’s an ideal base for oil paint and wood finishes. It’s a “drying oil”, which means it can transform into a hard, tough film. This doesn’t happen through “drying” in the sense of losing moisture through evaporation. The term is actually a misnomer. The transformation is through a chemical process called “polymerization”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The seasoning on cast iron is formed by fat polymerization, fat polymerization is maximized with a drying oil, and flaxseed oil is the only drying oil that’s edible. From that I deduced that flaxseed oil would be the ideal oil for seasoning cast iron.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reality check of this theory, I googled “season cast iron with flaxseed oil” to see what came up. The very first hit is a page written by a guy who seasons his cast iron cookware with linseed oil from the hardware store because it gives the hardest surface of anything he’s tried. (I’m not sure how safe that is; I don’t recommend it.) Below that were several sites selling traditional cast iron cookware from China, which they advertise as being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asianexports.cn/cast-iron-cooking-cauldrons/cat_6.html&quot;&gt;“preseasoned with high quality flax oil”&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know whether they really use food-grade flaxseed oil (which is expensive) or linseed oil from a hardware store. What’s significant is the claim. Seasoning with high quality flaxseed oil is something to brag about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this encouragement, I stripped one of my skillets and reseasoned it with flaxseed oil. As you can see in the picture above, the result was a dramatic improvement. The finish is smooth, hard, and evenly colored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seasoning Is Not Cooking: Different Principles Apply&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I seasoned a pan I chose avocado oil because it’s monounsaturated and doesn’t easily go rancid. It also has the highest smoke point of any edible oil, 520°F, so I could heat it in a 450°F oven without passing the smoke point. I knew that when cooking, you should never heat an oil past its smoke point because that causes the release of “free radicals”, which are carcinogenic. I was careful not to choose a polyunsaturated oil – and especially not an oil high in omega-3 fatty acids – because these are especially vulnerable to breakdown with heat and the release of free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it’s for exactly these reasons that the best oil for seasoning cast iron is an oil high in omega-3 fatty acids – in particular, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Free radicals are actually what enable the polymerization. Drying oils, which produce the hardest polymers, are characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially the omega-3 fatty acid ALA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lard that was traditionally used for seasoning 100 years ago was much higher in ALA than fat from pigs today, because back then pigs ate their natural diet. Today they are raised on industrial feedlots and forced to eat grain, making their fat low in omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since lard is traditional but no longer readily available, many people substitute bacon drippings, but this is a bad idea. If it’s conventional bacon, you’re baking in carcinogenic nitrates. But even organic bacon is not good for an initial seasoning because it’s filled with salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that Pam seems to work well in seasoning is that its main ingredient is canola oil, which is relatively high in ALA (10%), making it a “semi-drying oil”. Flaxseed oil, a drying oil, is 57% ALA. But it’s not a good idea to use a spray oil, no matter what oil it’s made with, because of its additives. You’re doing chemistry here. If you want good results, use pure ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat polymerization can be triggered or accelerated in a variety of ways. As best I can tell from my reading, the cast iron seasoning process is an example of “radical polymerization”. The process is initiated when something causes the release of free radicals in the oil. The free radicals then “crosslink” to form the tough, hard film you see in a well-seasoned pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the “something” that initiates the release of free radicals in fat? Iron, for one thing. High heat, light, and oxygen, for some others. To prevent cooking oils from going rancid – i.e., breaking down and releasing free radicals – you need to store them in dark, tightly sealed containers in a cool location. To initiate or accelerate the release of free radicals, put the oil in contact with bare iron and heat it above its smoke point, which will cause even non-drying oils to release free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t defined “free radical” or “crosslink” because that gets into details of chemistry that you don’t need to understand to season a cast iron pan. All you need to know is that the molecular structure of the oil changes and becomes something else, something tough and solid. The process is initiated with the release of free radicals, which then become crosslinked, creating a hard surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free radicals are carcinogenic inside your body, and also a cause of aging. So don’t ever heat oil you’re going to eat above its smoke point. If the oil starts to smoke, toss it out and start again. When you’re seasoning a pan, you’re not cooking food. By the time the seasoned pan comes out of the oven, there are no more free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Recipe for Perfect Cast Iron Seasoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is this: Smear a food-grade drying oil onto a cast iron pan, and then bake it above the oil’s smoke point. This will initiate the release of free radicals and polymerization. The more drying the oil, the harder the polymer. So start with the right oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your local health food store or organic grocery and buy a bottle of flaxseed oil. It’s sold as an omega-3 supplement and it’s in the refrigeration section because it goes rancid so easily. Check the expiration date to make sure it’s not already rancid. Buy an organic flaxseed oil. You don’t want to burn toxic chemicals into your cookware to leach out forever more. It’s a fairly expensive oil. I paid $17 for a 17 ounce bottle of cold-pressed, unrefined, organic flaxseed oil. As it says on the bottle, shake it before you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strip your pan down to the iron using the techniques I describe in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/perfect-popovers-and-how-to-clean-reseason-cast-iron/&quot;&gt;popover post&lt;/a&gt;. Heat the pan in a 200°F oven to be sure it’s bone dry and to open the pores of the iron a little. Then put it on a paper towel, pour a little flaxseed oil on it (don’t forget to shake the bottle), and rub the oil all over the pan with your hands, making sure to get into every nook and cranny. Your hands and the pan will be nice and oily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now rub it all off. Yup – all. All. Rub it off with paper towels or a cotton cloth until it looks like there is nothing left on the surface. There actually is oil left on the surface, it’s just very thin. The pan should look dry, not glistening with oil. Put the pan upside down in a cold oven. Most instructions say to put aluminum foil under it to catch any drips, but if your oil coating is as thin as it should be, there won’t be any drips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn the oven to a baking temperature of 500°F (or as high as your oven goes – mine only goes to 450°F) and let the pan preheat with the oven. When it reaches temperature, set the timer for an hour. After an hour, turn off the oven but do not open the oven door. Let it cool off with the pan inside for two hours, at which point it’s cool enough to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pan will come out of the oven a little darker, but matte in texture – not the semi-gloss you’re aiming for. It needs more coats. In fact, it needs at least six coats. So again rub on the oil, wipe it off, put it in the cold oven, let it preheat, bake for an hour, and let it cool in the oven for two hours. The picture above was taken after six coats of seasoning. At that point it starts to develop a bit of a sheen and the pan is ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try this, you will be tempted to use a thicker coat of oil to speed up the process. Don’t do it. It just gets you an uneven surface – or worse, baked on drips. Been there, done that. You can’t speed up the process. If you try, you’ll mess up the pan and have to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the very hot oven is to be sure the temperature is above the oil’s smoke point, and to maximally accelerate the release of free radicals. Unrefined flaxseed oil actually has the lowest smoke point of any oil (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/50/Smoke-Points-of-Various-Fats&quot;&gt;this table&lt;/a&gt;). But the higher the temperature the more it will smoke, and that’s good for seasoning (though bad for eating – &lt;em&gt;do not let oils smoke during cooking&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier there’s a myth floating around that vegetable oils leave a sticky residue. If the pan comes out of the oven sticky, the cause is one of three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You put the oil on too thick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your oven temperature was too low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your baking time was too short.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to use a suboptimal oil for seasoning, like Crisco or bacon drippings, and still end up with a usable pan. Many (most) people do this. But the seasoning will be relatively soft, not as nonstick, and will tend to wear off. If you want the hardest, slickest seasoning possible, use the right oil: flaxseed oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Editorial Note:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many flax oils contain added ingredients to prevent rancidity, and it’s the tendency of this oil to go rancid that makes it so good for seasoning pans. Flax oil only works if it’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;100% pure flax oil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with nothing added, so &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;read the ingredients!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; People have reported mixed results, and this is probably why.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a full alternative implementaion of the Rust language ontop of GCC which the goal to become fully upstream with the GNU toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of this project was a community effort several years ago where Rust was still at version 0.9; the language was subject to so much change that it became difficult for a community effort to play catch up. Now that the language is in a stable state, it is a good time to create alternative compilers. The developers of the project are keen “Rustaceans” with a desire to give back to the Rust community and to learn what GCC is capable of when it comes to a modern language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development Enviroment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fetch dependancies for ubuntu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ apt install build-essential libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev flex bison autogen gcc-multilib dejagnu
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ git clone git@github.com:Rust-GCC/gccrs.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compilation script. It is important to remember that GNU toolchain projects are designed to be built outside of its source directory this is why a build directory is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ mkdir gccrs-build
$ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; gccrs-build
$ ../gccrs/configure --prefix=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/span&gt;/gccrs-install --disable-bootstrap --enable-multilib --enable-languages=rust
$ make
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the compiler itself without make install we can simply invoke the compiler proper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ gdb --args ./gcc/rust1 test.rs -frust-dump-parse -Warray-bounds -dumpbase test.rs -mtune=generic -march=x86-64 -O0 -version -fdump-tree-gimple -o test.s -L/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/lib/../lib64 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/usr/lib/../lib64
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To invoking the compiler driver (gccrs) we need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ make install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then invoke the compiler as expected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ gccrs -g -O2 -c test.rs -o test.o
$ gccrs -o test test.o
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testsuite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test suite can be invoked via:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ make check-rust
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test cases can be found within gcc/testsuite/rust.test please feel free to contribute your specific test cases referencing any issues on github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Docker image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a docker image hosted over on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/philberty/gccrs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/philberty/gccrs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ docker pull philberty/gccrs
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can build your own image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ docker build . -t gccrs-dev
$ docker run --rm -v &quot;$PWD&quot;:/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp \
    gccrs-dev:latest gccrs -g -O2 -c \
    gcc/testsuite/rust.test/compilable/type_infer1.rs -o type_infer1.o
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware this project is designed to be pushed upstream to GCC when we reach some milestones and this means we require contribtions to have copyright assignment in place. Please see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all contributions must be code, we would love to see new test cases or bugs and issues to be reported. Feel free to add any comments on open PRs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be found on all usual Rust channels such as Zulip but we also have our own channels:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cabal: A peer-to-peer, off-grid, community-first, hackable chat platform</title>
<link>https://cabal.chat/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cabal.chat/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;ABOUT cabal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No servers are needed to join a cabal, or to start your own. Everything is stored and runs locally. A cabal can never go down or be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cabal is identified by its secret key (&lt;code&gt;cabal://7d99b453506b974...&lt;/code&gt;) that you share with your friends. This key lets them &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;join&lt;/em&gt; the cabal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabal works over the internet, but also lets you chat over the local network. If offline, you can still browse your full chat history, and send messages that will be sync'd with any future peers you connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
