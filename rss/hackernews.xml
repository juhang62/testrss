  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury labeled China a currency manipulator after the Chinese central bank let the yuan depreciate, capping a day of trade-war escalations that sparked a global fall in financial markets and fears the clash could stall the U.S.’s economic expansion. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty could pressure the Federal Reserve to consider more interest-rate cuts, following its decision last week to lower rates for the first time in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;China’s yuan fell as much as 1.9% to a record offshore low of 7.1087 to the dollar in Hong Kong, according to data from Refinitiv, putting the currency on course for its biggest single-day loss against the dollar since August 2015, when Beijing allowed a sudden depreciation. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In mainland China, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-yuan-falls-past-key-level-of-7-to-the-dollar-11564977948?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;yuan also weakened &lt;/a&gt;beyond the 7 yuan to the dollar level—which policy makers in recent years have defended—for the first time since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetRichText&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetRichText&amp;#10;          article__inset--wrap&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
    	

&lt;h4&gt;share your thoughts&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Does the depreciation of China’s currency put pressure on the U.S. to escalate this trade issue? How should the U.S. respond? Join the conversation below.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;In addition to the currency move, Beijing said that Chinese companies had suspended purchases of U.S. agricultural products, and that the government has not ruled out putting tariffs on U.S. farm goods purchased after Aug. 3.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;China’s central bank said Monday’s depreciation was “due to the effects of unilateralist and trade-protectionist measures and the expectations for tariffs against China.” People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said that China won’t engage in competitive devaluation and that the decline was due to market forces. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;President Trump, who as a candidate repeatedly threatened to designate China a currency manipulator, took the devaluation as a deliberate shot at the U.S. “China has always used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories, hurt our jobs, depress our workers’ wages and harm out farmers’ prices,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet on Monday. “Not anymore!”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The decision to label China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994 comes just four months after the U.S. Treasury passed on an opportunity to make such a formal designation as part of its semiannual currency report.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Treasury uses three criteria to apply the designation: actively intervening in their currency markets, having large trade surpluses with the U.S., and having large overall current-account surpluses. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Monday’s action by Treasury is mostly symbolic, requiring the U.S. administration to consult with the International Monetary Fund to try to eliminate the unfair advantage the currency measures have given a country. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“The announcements from Beijing represent a direct shot at the White House and seem designed for maximum political impact,” said Chris Krueger,  strategist at Cowen Washington Research Group. “We expect a quick—and possibly intemperate—response from the White House, and consequently expect a more rapid escalation of trade tensions.”&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetDynamic&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  article__inset&amp;#10;        article__inset--type-InsetDynamic&amp;#10;          article__inset--wrap&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
        &lt;div class=&quot;dynamic-inset-container article__inset__dynamic&quot;&gt;
            
&lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;The back-and-forth between the world’s two largest economies sent global financial markets reeling, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 767 points, or 2.9%, to 25,717.74 and the S&amp;amp;P 500 index falling 3% to 2,844.74.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;U.S. officials had been expecting retaliation from Beijing after Mr. Trump said last week he would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-trump-ordered-new-chinese-tariffs-over-objections-of-advisers-11564912949?mod=article_inline&amp;amp;mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;impose 10% tariffs &lt;/a&gt;starting Sept. 1 on about $300 billion in Chinese goods that aren’t now subject to levies. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The president followed that up by saying he could ratchet tariffs even higher—even above 25%—as he complained that China hasn’t followed through on expectations it would buy more U.S. farm products.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The White House had no comment on next steps in the trade conflict Monday.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration began imposing rounds of tariffs last year in an effort to get China to make structural changes to its economic system to benefit U.S. companies and to purchase more U.S. products to narrow the trade deficit. Some observers expect the U.S. to pause before taking any countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“This is not a surprise,” said Derek Scissors, a senior trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute think tank who occasionally consults with the administration. “There’s nobody with an agenda that wants to respond to this, with the possible exception of the boss.”&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump has long complained that China keeps the yuan’s value artificially low to make its goods cheaper on global markets. Traders contend that the Chinese government is merely allowing the currency to respond to market conditions as the trade war fuels concern about the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Other emerging markets are also tanking,” said Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. “If China is going to allow market forces to determine the exchange rate, this is what will happen with the yuan.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Chinese authorities will likely be wary of letting the yuan depreciate too far. Continued sharp declines in the currency could stoke capital outflows and make it difficult for local companies to service their dollar-denominated debt.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump repeated on Monday his frequent accusation that China manipulates the yuan.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“China is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of Billions of Dollars they have been taking from the U.S. with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation,” he wrote in a series of tweets. “Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Fed officials said the U.S. central bank doesn’t seek to influence the dollar’s value, though lower interest rates do tend to cause the greenback to weaken against other currencies. The Treasury Department is the lead actor on currency policy within the U.S. government, Fed officials have noted.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;If it wants to intervene in currency markets, Mr. Krueger said, the administration could tap a vehicle known as the Exchange Stabilization Fund.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;But the fallout from Mr. Trump’s latest tariff threat has already added pressure on the Fed to continue lowering interest rates. Futures markets are currently pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at its next policy meeting, on Sept. 17-18, according to






            &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/CME&quot;&gt;CME Group&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;


      That’s up from 51% last Wednesday, when the Fed reduced its benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 2% and 2.25%.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“We’re committed to sustaining the expansion, and I’m certainly monitoring developments for their implication for the outlook, and I’ll continue to be very attentive to them,” Fed governor Lael Brainard said at an event Monday in Kansas City, Mo.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Of paramount importance to the Fed is ensuring that a global growth slump, no matter the cause, doesn’t derail the U.S. economic expansion. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Fed officials have recently cited evidence that uncertainty stemming from the trade war has weighed on business investment and contributed to a slowdown in manufacturing—major factors in their decision to lower interest rates last week.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Another risk from the trade war is the potential for market turmoil that crimps consumer and business confidence, causing spending to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that trade uncertainty was harder for the Fed to forecast than other potential policy shocks, both because there is less recent experience of tariff escalation between major trading partners and because of the unpredictable nature of the administration’s negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;“Markets move quickly. It takes some time to see how that evolves, and so the best you can do right now is just to monitor and see how that unfolds,” said Kansas City Fed President Esther George.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The central bank’s next policy decision is scheduled for Sept. 18.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Powell “will ultimately have to eat his words” that last week’s rate cut was a “midterm correction in rates,” said Scott Anderson,  chief economist at Bank of the West. “The July rate cut is, in fact, only the first in a series of cuts that will be needed to forestall an outright economic recession in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T.%20Jaynes&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: E.T. Jaynes&quot;&gt;E.T. Jaynes&lt;/a&gt; in his posthumous &lt;a href=&quot;http://omega.albany.edu:8008/JaynesBook.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian%20statistics&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Bayesian statistics&quot;&gt;Bayesian statistics&lt;/a&gt;) includes a chapter 5 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://omega.albany.edu:8008/ETJ-PS/cc5d.ps&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Queer Uses For Probability Theory”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, discussing such topics as ESP; miracles; heuristics &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive%20bias&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Cognitive bias&quot;&gt;biases&lt;/a&gt;; how visual perception is theory-laden; philosophy of science with regard to Newtonian mechanics and the famed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discovery%20of%20Neptune&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: discovery of Neptune&quot;&gt;discovery of Neptune&lt;/a&gt;; horse-racing &amp;amp; weather forecasting; and finally—section 5.8, &lt;q&gt;“Bayesian jurisprudence”&lt;/q&gt;. Jaynes’s analysis is somewhat similar in spirit to my above analysis, although mine is not explicitly Bayesian except perhaps in the discussion of gender as eliminating one necessary bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to apply probability theory in various situations in which we can’t always reduce it to numbers very well, but still it shows automatically what kind of information would be relevant to help us do plausible reasoning. Suppose someone in New York City has committed a murder, and you don’t know at first who it is, but you know that there are 10 million people in New York City. On the basis of no knowledge but this, &lt;span class=&quot;mjpage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-chtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-math&quot; aria-label=&quot;Equation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-semantics&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mtext&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;Guilty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo MJXc-space3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;−&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mn&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;70&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the plausibility that any particular person is the guilty one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much positive evidence for guilt is necessary before we decide that some man should be put away? Perhaps +40 &lt;em&gt;db&lt;/em&gt;, although your reaction may be that this is not safe enough, and the number ought to be higher. If we raise this number we give increased protection to the innocent, but at the cost of making it more difficult to convict the guilty; and at some point the interests of society as a whole cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if 1000 guilty men are set free, we know from only too much experience that 200 or 300 of them will proceed immediately to inflict still more crimes upon society, and their escaping justice will encourage 100 more to take up crime. So it is clear that the damage to society as a whole caused by allowing 1000 guilty men to go free, is far greater than that caused by falsely convicting one innocent man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an emotional reaction against this statement, I ask you to think: if you were a judge, would you rather face one man whom you had convicted falsely; or 100 victims of crimes that you could have prevented? Setting the threshold at +40 &lt;em&gt;db&lt;/em&gt; will mean, crudely, that on the average not more than one conviction in 10,000 will be in error; a judge who required juries to follow this rule would probably not make one false conviction in a working lifetime on the bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, if we took +40 db starting out from -70 db, this means that in order to ensure a conviction you would have to produce about 110 db of evidence for the guilt of this particular person. Suppose now we learn that this person had a motive. What does that do to the plausibility for his guilt? Probability theory says&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the [importance] of learning that the person had a motive depends almost entirely on the probability &lt;span class=&quot;mjpage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-chtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-math&quot; aria-label=&quot;Equation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-semantics&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mtext&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;Motive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mtext&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;Not Guilty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that an innocent person would also have a motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evidently agrees with our common sense, if we ponder it for a moment. If the deceased were kind and loved by all, hardly anyone would have a motive to do him in. Learning that, nevertheless, our suspect &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a motive, would then be very [important] information. If the victim had been an unsavory character, who took great delight in all sorts of foul deeds, then a great many people would have a motive, and learning that our suspect was one of them is not so [important]. The point of this is that we don’t know what to make of the information that our suspect had a motive, unless we also know something about the character of the deceased. But how many members of juries would realize that, unless it was pointed out to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that a very enlightened judge, with powers not given to judges under present law, had perceived this fact and, when testimony about the motive was introduced, he directed his assistants to determine for the jury the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of people in New York City who had a motive. If this number is &lt;span class=&quot;mjpage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-chtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-math&quot; aria-label=&quot;Equation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-semantics&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-msub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-sub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see that the population of New York has canceled out of the equation; as soon as we know the number of people who had a motive, then it doesn’t matter any more how large the city was. Note that (5-39) continues to say the right thing even when &lt;span class=&quot;mjpage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-chtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-math&quot; aria-label=&quot;Equation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-semantics&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-msub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-sub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mi&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is only 1 or 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go on this way for a long time, and we think you will find it both enlightening and entertaining to do so. For example, we now learn that the suspect was seen near the scene of the crime shortly before. From Bayes’ theorem, the [importance] of this depends almost entirely on how many innocent persons were also in the vicinity. If you have ever been told not to trust Bayes’ theorem, you should follow a few examples like this a good deal further, and see how infallibly it tells you what information would be relevant, what irrelevant, in plausible reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years there has grown up a considerable literature on Bayesian jurisprudence; for a review with many references, see Vignaux and Robertson (1996) [This is apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Interpreting-Evidence-Evaluating-Forensic-Courtroom/dp/0471960268/?tag=gwernnet-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpreting Evidence: Evaluating Forensic Science in the Courtroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; –Editor].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in situations where we would be quite unable to say that numerical values should be used, Bayes’ theorem still reproduces qualitatively just what your common sense (after perhaps some meditation) tells you. This is the fact that George Polya demonstrated in such o exhaustive detail that the present writer was convinced that the connection must be more than qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Employee Alleges Discrimination Against Pregnant Women in Viral Memo</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nmkx/google-employee-alleges-discrimination-against-pregnant-women-in-viral-memo</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nmkx/google-employee-alleges-discrimination-against-pregnant-women-in-viral-memo</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbmqxq/heres-the-memo-currently-going-viral-at-google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A memo&lt;/a&gt; written by a Google employee that accuses the company of discriminating and retaliating against her for being pregnant has been seen by more than 10,000 employees at the internet giant, Motherboard has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the woman posted the memo, titled &quot;I'm Not Returning to Google After Maternity Leave, and Here is Why,&quot; to an internal company message board for expecting and new mothers. The memo was reposted to other internal message boards and has since gone viral, multiple current Google employees in different parts of the company have told Motherboard. Since then, employees have been posting memes that have gathered thousands of likes. The memes were made in support of the woman on an internal message board called “Memegen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memo follows months of worker action at Google. In November, employees staged a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;worldwide walkout&lt;/a&gt; in which thousands of employees protested exit packages &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?module=inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;worth millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; given to male executives who had been accused of sexual harassment, while staying silent about that harassment. In January, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/10/google-sexual-harassment-shareholder-lawsuit-alphabet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shareholders alleged that the company&lt;/a&gt; tried to cover up sexual misconduct at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sharing this statement because I hope it informs needed change in how Google handles discrimination, harassment and retaliation,” the woman wrote. “This is a long read, but the details are important in understanding the often drawn-out, isolating and painful experience of victims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Also, if anything similar has happened to you, know that you’re not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565018951167-google-meme.jpeg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;One of the memes shared in the Google internal board for meme sharing]&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565018951167-google-meme.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the memes shared in the Google internal board for meme sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“WOW. I can’t wait till absolutely nothing changes as a result,” one employee posted about the memo. “She deserves better than this continued train-wreck.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the memo, which is more than 2,300 words long, the woman says that her manager made discriminatory remarks about pregnant women. She says she reported the manager to human resources, which she alleges spurred retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I documented what my boss was saying and reached out to HR to ask for help in navigating the situation. It was shared that others had reported my manager behaving inappropriately and that feedback had already been given to her. I was told my comments might be shared directly with my boss, but not to worry because strong measures are in place at Google to prevent retaliation,” she wrote. “Almost immediately upon my discussions with HR, my manager’s demeanor towards me changed, and drastically. I endured months of angry chats and emails, vetoed projects, her ignoring me during in-person encounters, and public shaming.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you work or have you worked at Google, or another tech company? We'd love to hear from you about workplace culture. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzofb@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzofb@vice.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman, who was also a manager, says she eventually joined another team, but wasn't allowed to manage anyone on that team until she returned from maternity leave; she claims she was told that her maternity leave might “stress the team” and “rock the boat.” She says that she and her baby had potentially life-threatening complications toward the end of her pregnancy, and that she would need to go on maternity leave earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During one conversation with my new manager in which I reiterated an early leave and upcoming bedrest, she told me that she had just listened to an NPR segment that debunked the benefits of bedrest,” she wrote. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;She also shared that her doctor had ordered her to take bedrest, but that she ignored the order and worked up until the day before she delivered her son via cesarean section. My manager then emphasized in this same meeting that a management role was no longer guaranteed upon my return from maternity leave, and that she supported my interviewing for other roles at Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motherboard has obtained and verified the authenticity of the memo, and has verified that more than 10,000 people within the company have read it. Motherboard has not been able to independently verify all the claims made in the memo. When reached for comment, a Google spokesperson declined to answer Motherboard’s questions. Instead, the spokesperson sent this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We prohibit retaliation in the workplace and publicly share our very clear policy. To make sure that no complaint raised goes unheard at Google, we give employees multiple channels to report concerns, including anonymously, and investigate all allegations of retaliation,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motherboard reached out to the author of the memo, who declined to comment. Motherboard has posted the full memo here with personal information redacted because we have not been able to verify all of the claims made in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565019037918-image2.jpeg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;One of the memes shared in the Google internal board for meme sharing. “PeopleOps” refers to the human resources department.&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1565019037918-image2.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the memes shared in the Google internal board for meme sharing. “PeopleOps” refers to the human resources department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the memes posted about the memo defend the woman and say that Google HR should take issues like this more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“0 days since last time I was too scared to meme about a topic,” one employee joked in a meme, riffing on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/futurama-bge3Lqq8MSwb6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular &lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt; GIF&lt;/a&gt;. Another meme joked that Googlers have less trust in HR than they do in &quot;gas-station sushi.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is alarming. And sadly not surprising. It fits a long-standing pattern at the company. Google has a culture of retaliation that is reflected in its abysmal diversity numbers,” a former Googler who read the memo said. “The pipeline isn't the problem: the racist, misogynist culture that penalizes those who speak up is.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memo highlights how Google employees and executives are still reckoning with the company’s alleged discrimination against women and minotities. Exactly two years ago today, another, much different memo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzbm4a/employees-anti-diversity-manifesto-goes-internally-viral-at-google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went internally viral at Google&lt;/a&gt;. That one was written by the now infamous James Damore, an engineer who wrote a 10,000-word, unscientific memo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evzjww/here-are-the-citations-for-the-anti-diversity-manifesto-circulating-at-google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attempting to argue&lt;/a&gt; that women are naturally less disposed to be good engineers compared to men. The purpose of that memo was to get Google to scale back its diversity efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>8chan goes dark after hardware provider discontinues service</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;vVMT7a&quot;&gt;Internet hate forum 8chan has gone dark after web services company Voxility banned the site — and also banned 8chan’s new host Epik, which had been leasing web space from it. Epik began working with 8chan today after web services giant Cloudflare cut off service, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/4/20754310/cloudflare-8chan-fredrick-brennan-ddos-attack&quot;&gt;following the latest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/04/business/el-paso-shooting-8chan-biz/index.html&quot;&gt;at least three&lt;/a&gt; mass shootings linked to 8chan. But Stanford researcher Alex Stamos &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1158392795687575554&quot;&gt;noted that Epik&lt;/a&gt; seemed to lease servers from Voxility, and when Voxility discovered the content, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/voxility/status/1158406706344398849&quot;&gt;cut ties&lt;/a&gt; with Epik almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;txZj4N&quot;&gt;“As soon as we were notified of the content that Epik was hosting, we made the decision to totally ban them,” Voxility business development VP Maria Sirbu told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Sirbu said it was unlikely that Voxility would work with Epik again. “This is the second situation we’ve had with the reseller and this is not tolerable,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;3dFvJm&quot;&gt;Epik’s website remains accessible, but 8chan — which was available earlier this morning — now returns an error message. Epik didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, so it’s not clear what its next steps will be or how heavily it depended on Voxility. Over the past year, Epik has raised its profile by working with far-right-friendly sites (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban&quot;&gt;like Gab&lt;/a&gt;) that have been banned by other web service companies. Earlier this year, it acquired the denial-of-service protection service BitMitigate, which has previously stepped in to protect sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/spurned-by-major-companies-the-daily-stormer-returns-to-the-web&quot;&gt;the neo-Nazi site &lt;em&gt;Daily Stormer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M4qamL&quot;&gt;CEO Rob Monster confirmed that Epik was serving 8chan this morning, though he said Epik had not proactively solicited business from the site. “Our services fill the ever growing need for a neutral service provider that will not terminate accounts based on arbitrary reasoning or political pressure,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://domainnamewire.com/2019/08/05/epik-ceo-rob-monster-statement-on-8chan/&quot;&gt;Monster wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “From what little we know so far, the chans are not lawless and do have moderation, especially in regards to DMCA and content which is illegal in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;21ELvh&quot;&gt;Cloudflare, by contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/terminating-service-for-8chan/&quot;&gt;said that while&lt;/a&gt; 8chan “may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.” Cloudflare noted that its actions were unlikely to keep 8chan offline, but Voxility has at least temporarily done so.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Administration Using the Full Power of the Surveillance State on Whistleblowers</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2019/08/04/whistleblowers-surveillance-fbi-trump/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2019/08/04/whistleblowers-surveillance-fbi-trump/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;200&quot; readability=&quot;23.052884615385&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;overnment whistleblowers are&lt;/u&gt; increasingly being charged under laws such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2019/05/15/the-espionage-axe-donald-trump-and-the-war-against-a-free-press/&quot;&gt;Espionage Act&lt;/a&gt;, but they aren’t spies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re ordinary Americans and, like most of us, they carry smartphones that automatically get backed up to the cloud. When they want to talk to someone, they send them a text or call them on the phone. They use Gmail and share memes and talk politics on Facebook. Sometimes they even log in to these accounts from their work computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, during the course of their work, they see something disturbing. Maybe it’s that the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/the-assassination-complex/&quot;&gt;often has no idea&lt;/a&gt; if the people it kills in drone strikes are civilians. Or that the NSA &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/&quot;&gt;witnessed a cyberattack&lt;/a&gt; against local election officials in 2016 that U.S. intelligence believes was orchestrated by Russia, even though the president is always on TV saying the opposite. Or that the FBI &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/hidden-loopholes-allow-fbi-agents-to-infiltrate-political-and-religious-groups/&quot;&gt;uses hidden loopholes&lt;/a&gt; to bypass its own rules against infiltrating political and religious groups. Or that Donald Trump’s associates are implicated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/michael-cohen-shell-company-payments.html&quot;&gt;sketchy&lt;/a&gt; financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;202&quot; readability=&quot;48.451833436917&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they search government databases for more information and maybe print some of the documents they find. They search for related information using Google. Maybe they even send a text message to a friend about how insane this is while they consider possible next steps. Should they contact a journalist? They look up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/source/&quot;&gt;tips&lt;/a&gt; pages of news organizations they like and start researching how to use Tor Browser. All of this happens before they’ve reached out to a journalist for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people aren’t very aware of it, but we’re all under surveillance. Telecom companies and tech giants have access to nearly all of our private data, from our exact physical locations at any given time to the content of our text messages and emails. Even when our private data doesn’t get sent directly to tech companies, our devices are still recording it locally. Do you know exactly what you were doing on your computer two months ago today at 3:05 p.m.? Your web browser probably does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while we all live under extensive surveillance, for government employees and contractors — especially those with a security clearance — privacy is virtually nonexistent. Everything they do on their work computers is monitored. Every time they search a database, their search term and the exact moment they searched for it is logged and associated with them personally. The same is true when they access a secret document, or when they print anything, or when they plug a USB stick into their work computer. There might be logs of exactly when an employee takes screenshots or copies and pastes something. Even when they try to outsmart their work computer by taking photos directly of their screen, video cameras in their workplace might be recording their every move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government workers with &lt;a href=&quot;https://fas.org/sgp/isoo/new_sf312.pdf&quot;&gt;security clearance&lt;/a&gt; promise “never [to] divulge classified information to anyone” who is not authorized to receive it. But for many whistleblowers, the decision to go public results from troubling insights into government activity, coupled with the belief that as long as that activity remains secret, the system will not change. While there are some protections for whistleblowers who raise their concerns internally or complain to Congress, there is also a long history of those same people being punished for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing use of the Espionage Act, a 1917 law that criminalizes the release of “national defense” information by anyone “with intent or reason to believe that it is to be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation,” shows how the system is rigged against whistleblowers. Government insiders charged under the law are not allowed to defend themselves by arguing that their decision to share what they know was prompted by an impulse to help Americans confront and end government abuses. “The act is blind to the possibility that the public’s interest in learning of government incompetence, corruption, or criminality might outweigh the government’s interest in protecting a given secret,” Jameel Jaffer, head of the Knight First Amendment Institute, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-espionage-act-and-a-growing-threat-to-press-freedom&quot;&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;. “It is blind to the difference between whistle-blowers and spies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we all live under extensive surveillance, for government employees and contractors — especially those with a security clearance — privacy is virtually nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;205&quot; readability=&quot;100.04427171342&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the four Espionage Act cases based on alleged leaks in the Trump era, the most unusual concerned Joshua Schulte, a former CIA software developer accused of leaking CIA documents and hacking tools known as the Vault 7 disclosures to WikiLeaks. Schulte’s case is different from the others because, after the FBI confiscated his desktop computer, phone, and other devices in a March 2017 raid, the government allegedly discovered over 10,000 images depicting child sexual abuse on his computer, as well as a file and chat server he ran that included logs of him discussing child sexual abuse images and screenshots of him using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvn83q/joshua-schulte-cia-vault-7-wikileaks-opsec&quot;&gt;racist slurs&lt;/a&gt;. Prosecutors initially charged Schulte with several counts related to child pornography and later with sexual assault in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loudountimes.com/news/suspected-cia-leaker-was-charged-with-sexual-assault-in-loudoun/article_5b86c70c-5de4-11e8-8348-3b4a3bcac997.html&quot;&gt;separate case&lt;/a&gt;, based on evidence from his phone. Only in June 2018, in a superseding indictment, did the government finally charge him under the Espionage Act for leaking the hacking tools. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other three Espionage Act cases related to alleged leaks of government secrets have involved people who are said to have been sources for The Intercept. The Intercept does not comment on its anonymous sources, although it has acknowledged &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/07/11/first-look-to-support-defense-of-reality-winner-in-espionage-act-prosecution/&quot;&gt;falling short&lt;/a&gt; of its own editorial standards in one case. It is not surprising that a publication founded as a result of the Snowden leaks, and one that has specialized in publishing secret government documents whose disclosure serves the public interest, has been an appealing target for the Trump administration’s war on whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government comes to this war armed with laws like the Espionage Act that are ripe for abuse, and with the overwhelming firepower of surveillance technology that has almost no limits when applied to its own workers and contractors. But journalists also have tools at their disposal, including the First Amendment and the ability to educate ourselves about the methods the government uses to track and spy on its employees. We’ve mined the court filings in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressfreedomtracker.us/leak-case/&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressfreedomtracker.us/leak-case/&quot;&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pressfreedomtracker.us/leak-case/&quot;&gt;leak cases&lt;/a&gt; filed by Trump’s Justice Department &lt;span&gt;to identify the methods the government uses to unmask confidential sources. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;hen a government worker&lt;/u&gt; becomes a whistleblower, the FBI gets access to reams of data describing exactly what happened on government computers and who searched for what in government databases, which helps narrow down the list of suspects. How many people accessed this document? How many people printed it? Can any of their work emails be used against them? What evidence can be extracted from their work computers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the FBI has a list of suspects based on the vast amount of data the government itself has collected, they use court orders and search warrants to access even more information about the targets of its investigation. They compel tech companies, whose business models often rely on collecting as much information on their users as possible, to hand over everything, including personal emails, text messages, phone call metadata, smartphone backups, location data, files stored in Dropbox, and much more. FBI agents raid the houses and search the vehicles of these suspects, extracting whatever they can from any phones, computers, and hard drives they find. Sometimes, this includes files the suspects thought they had deleted or text messages and documents sent through encrypted messaging services like Signal or WhatsApp. The encryption these apps use protects messages while they’re sent over the internet so that the services themselves can’t spy on the content or hand it over to the government, but this encryption doesn’t protect messages stored on a phone or other device that is seized and searched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because whistleblowers aren’t spies, they normally don’t know how to avoid this kind of surveillance. One whistleblower who knew what he was up against, former CIA and National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, didn’t see any way to get secret government information into the public domain while retaining his anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I appreciate your concern for my safety,” Snowden wrote in an encrypted email, from an anonymous address not associated with his real identity that he only accessed over the Tor network, to filmmaker Laura Poitras in the spring of 2013, “but I already know how this will end for me and I accept the risk.” In the documentary film “Citizenfour,” Snowden explains that the security measures he took while reaching out to journalists were only designed to buy him enough time to get information about the NSA’s overwhelming invasions of privacy to the American public. “I don’t think there’s a case that I’m not going to be discovered in the fullness of time,” he said from a hotel room in Hong Kong before he publicly came forward as the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to live in a world where it’s safer for people to speak out when they see something disturbing, we need technology that protects &lt;em&gt;everyone’s&lt;/em&gt; privacy, and it needs to be enabled by default. Such technology would also protect the privacy of whistleblowers &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they decide to become sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;n 2017,&lt;/u&gt; in the first indictment of an alleged whistleblower since Trump became president, the Justice Department charged Reality Leigh Winner under the Espionage Act for leaking a top-secret NSA document to a news organization that was widely reported to be The Intercept. At the time, Winner was a 25-year-old decorated U.S. Air Force veteran, who was also a dedicated CrossFit trainer with a passion for slowing the climate crisis. The document was an NSA intelligence report describing a cyberattack: Russian military intelligence officers hacked a U.S. company that provides election support in swing states and then, days before the 2016 election, sent local election officials — who were customers of this company — over 100 malware-infected emails, hoping to hack them next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Pullquote Pullquote--right&quot; data-reactid=&quot;206&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government insiders charged under the Espionage Act are not allowed to defend themselves by arguing that their decision was in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;208&quot; readability=&quot;26.510638297872&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court documents, Winner was one of only six people who had printed the document she was accused of leaking (she had searched for, accessed, and printed the document on May 9, 2017). After searching all six of those employees’ work computers, they found that Winner was the only one who also had email contact with the news organization that published the document. (Using her private Gmail account, she had asked the news organization for a transcript of a podcast episode.) At the time, those who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/business/media/intercept-reality-winner-russia-trump-leak.html&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; The Intercept of having revealed Winner’s identity said that the online publication, in an attempt to authenticate a document that had been sent anonymously, shared a copy with the government that contained a crease, suggesting that it had been printed. But Winner’s email and printing history alone would have made her the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FBI agents then raided her house and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/12/28/how-the-interrogation-of-reality-winner-reveals-the-deceptive-tactics-of-exceedingly-friendly-fbi-agents/&quot;&gt;interrogated her&lt;/a&gt; without a lawyer present and without telling her she had a right to remain silent, leading to defense accusations that the government violated her Miranda rights. In her house, they found handwritten notes about how to use a burner phone and Tor Browser. They also seized her Android smartphone and her laptop and extracted evidence from both devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;210&quot; readability=&quot;70.24639878696&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI also ordered several tech companies to hand over information from Winner’s accounts. Facebook provided data from her Facebook and Instagram accounts, Google provided data from two separate Gmail accounts she used, Twitter provided data on her account, and AT&amp;amp;T also contributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know exactly what these companies turned over, but we do know that they were ordered to disclose all information associated with her accounts, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Usernames, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and credit card numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A history of every time she logged on, for how long, and from which IP addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metadata about every instance of communication she ever had over these services, including the type of communication, the source and destination, and the file size or duration of the communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI also requested records of accounts that were linked to her Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter, and AT&amp;amp;T accounts — those that were created using the same email address, accessed from the same IP address, or logged into from the same web browser. (If users don’t take extra steps to remain anonymous, service providers can trivially link different accounts accessed from the same computer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI also extracted everything it could from Winner’s phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Her photos, including one that was taken on February 7, 2017, of a webpage that listed eight SecureDrop servers run by different media organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data extracted from her smartphone apps like the Facebook app, which contained private messages she had exchanged with her sister, which were later used against her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her phone’s browser history: On March 7, she visited a website that contained a list of “dark web email providers,” and she searched the internet for “tor email.” On May 9, at “approximately 7:29:49 p.m. (EST),” Winner searched for and viewed the tips page of the news outlet to which she was accused of leaking the NSA document, as well as the tips page of a second news outlet; later that night, she logged into her Dropbox account, and three minutes after that, she viewed the first media organization’s tips page again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the FBI got a search warrant issued to Dropbox, demanding all the files and other information stored in Winner’s account, as well as “any messages, records, files, logs, or information that have been deleted but are still available to Dropbox, Inc.” Dropbox gave the FBI a thumb drive containing that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also got a search warrant issued to Google, demanding nearly everything stored in Winner’s account, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the messages in her Gmail account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her Google search history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her location history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of her web browser activity that could be identified based on web browser cookies (this could possibly include a list of every webpage she visited that used the Google Analytics service).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backups of her Android phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on metadata that the FBI got from its previous court order to Google, the bureau learned about a new, separate Google account that it suspected Winner used, which it hadn’t previously known about. The search warrant demanded data from this other account as well. Google gave the FBI “electronic files in excess of 809mb (compressed)” of data from Winner’s two Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI also extracted data from her laptop. It discovered that she had downloaded Tor Browser on February 1, 2017, and had used it in February and March. The FBI also discovered a note saved to her desktop that contained the username and password for a small email company called VFEmail, and so it got another search warrant demanding a copy of everything in the VFEmail account as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winner was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/statement-us-attorney-bobby-l-christine-regarding-sentencing-reality-winner&quot;&gt;longest sentence&lt;/a&gt; ever given to an alleged journalistic source by a federal court. The Intercept’s parent company, First Look Media, contributed to Winner’s legal defense through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pressfreedomdefensefund.org/&quot;&gt;Press Freedom Defense Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The only black FBI special agent in the Minneapolis field office, he was especially disturbed by what he saw as “systemic biases” within the bureau, particularly when it came to the FBI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/10/18/terry-albury-sentencing-fbi/&quot;&gt;mistreatment of informants&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the Justice Department charged Albury with espionage for leaking secret documents to a news organization, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/justice-dept-charges-minnesota-fbi-agent-for-leaking-secret-document-to-news-outlet/478203203/&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; The Intercept, which in early 2017 published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/series/the-fbis-secret-rules/&quot;&gt;series of revelations&lt;/a&gt; based on confidential FBI guidelines, including details about controversial tactics for &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/despite-anti-profiling-rules-the-fbi-uses-race-and-religion-when-deciding-who-to-target/&quot;&gt;investigating minorities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/secret-rules-make-it-pretty-easy-for-the-fbi-to-spy-on-journalists-2/&quot;&gt;spying on journalists&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Even though the FBI did not know whether the documents had been printed before being shared, it was not hard to track down who had accessed them. The FBI identified 16 people who had accessed one of the 27 documents that the media organization published on its website. They searched all 16 of those people’s work computers, including Albury’s, and found that his computer had also accessed “over two-thirds” of the documents that were made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court documents, the FBI used a variety of activities on Albury’s computer as evidence against him: exactly which documents he accessed and when, when he took screenshots, when he copied and pasted these screenshots into unsaved documents, and when he printed them. For example, on May 10, 2016, between 12:34 p.m. and 12:50 p.m., Albury accessed two classified documents. Nineteen minutes later, he pasted two screenshots into an unsaved Microsoft Word document, and over the following 45 minutes, he pasted 11 more screenshots into an unsaved Excel document. Throughout the day, he accessed more secret documents, pasting more screenshots into the Excel document. At 5:29 p.m., he printed it and then closed the document without saving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t just his work computer that was under surveillance. Using a closed-circuit video surveillance system in his workplace, the FBI captured video of Albury. On June 16, August 23, and August 24, 2017, the system recorded Albury holding a silver digital camera, inserting “what appeared to be a digital memory stick” into it, and taking photos of his screen. On all three days, the court documents say, Albury was viewing documents on his computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It became a human rights thing for him,” Albury’s wife said in a court document requesting a lenient sentence, “the mistreatment and tactics that were used by FBI and how he was a part of it.” Albury, who is 40 years old, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years in prison and three years of supervised release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;ervices like Signal&lt;/u&gt; and WhatsApp have made it simple for journalists to communicate securely with their sources by encrypting messages so that only the phones on either side of the conversation can access them and not the service itself. (This isn’t true when using non-encrypted messaging services like Skype and Slack, direct messengers on Twitter and Facebook, or normal text messages and phone calls.) However, encrypted services don’t protect messages when a phone gets physically searched and the user hasn’t deleted their message history. This was made exceedingly clear on June 7, 2018, when the Justice Department indicted former Senate Intelligence Committee aide James Wolfe for making false statements to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court documents, Wolfe had told FBI leak investigators that he had not been in contact with journalists. But the indictment against Wolfe quoted the content of Signal conversations he’d had with journalists. It doesn’t mention how the FBI obtained these messages, but the only reasonable conclusion is that agents found them when they searched his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a case that I’m not going to be discovered in the fullness of time,” Edward Snowden said from a hotel room in Hong Kong before he publicly came forward as the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;216&quot; readability=&quot;56.404563563926&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to obtaining his Signal messages, the FBI searched Wolfe’s work email and found messages he’d traded with a journalist. The FBI knew about physical meetings he’d had with journalists and where they had occurred. They mention hundreds of text messages he’d exchanged with journalists, which journalists he’d talked to on the phone, and for how long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same investigation, the Justice Department sent court orders to Google and Verizon to seize years’ worth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/us/politics/times-reporter-phone-records-seized.html&quot;&gt;phone and email records&lt;/a&gt; belonging to New York Times national security reporter Ali Watkins, who had previously worked for BuzzFeed News and Politico. The FBI was investigating Watkins’s source for a BuzzFeed article about a Russian spy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alimwatkins/a-former-trump-adviser-met-with-a-russian-spy#.sad6nXv32&quot;&gt;trying to recruit&lt;/a&gt; Trump adviser Carter Page. The seized records went all the way back to when Watkins was in college. This was the first known case in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/07/15/ali-watkins-new-york-times-leak-indictment/&quot;&gt;the Trump administration went after a reporter’s communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfe pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about contacting the media and was sentenced to two months in prison and a $7,500 fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;ven without physically&lt;/u&gt; searching a phone, the FBI can obtain real-time metadata, who sends messages to whom and when, for at least one encrypted messaging app. This happened in the case of Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards, a senior official with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. At the end of 2018, the Justice Department indicted Edwards for allegedly providing a journalist, widely reported to be BuzzFeed News’s Jason Leopold, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/secret-finding-60-russian-payments-to-finance-election&quot;&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fbi-probe-of-paul-manafort-focuses-on-13-suspicious-wire&quot;&gt;suspicious&lt;/a&gt; financial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/suspicious-payments-kislyak-russia-embassy-mueller&quot;&gt;transactions&lt;/a&gt; involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/peter-w-smith-hillary-clinton-emails-trump-flynn-money&quot;&gt;GOP operatives&lt;/a&gt;, senior members &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov&quot;&gt;of Trump’s campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and a Kremlin-connected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/maria-butina-paul-erickson-suspicious-bank-money-russia&quot;&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/maria-butina-paul-erickson-suspicious-bank-money-russia&quot;&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; and Russian oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court documents, the FBI got a “judicially-authorized pen register and trap and trace order” for Edwards’s personal cellphone. This is a court order that allows the FBI to collect various types of communication metadata from the phone using a range of techniques — ordering third parties to hand over this metadata, for instance, or using a device such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gv5k3x/heres-how-much-a-stingray-cell-phone-surveillance-tool-costs&quot;&gt;StingRay&lt;/a&gt;, which simulates a cellphone tower in order to trick phones into connecting to it so they can be spied on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this court order, the FBI was apparently able to gather real-time metadata from an encrypted messaging app on Edwards’s phone. For example, on August 1, 2018, at 12:33 a.m., six hours after the pen register order “became operative” and the day after BuzzFeed News published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/maria-butina-paul-erickson-suspicious-bank-money-russia&quot;&gt;one of the articles&lt;/a&gt;, Edwards allegedly exchanged 70 encrypted messages with the journalist. The following day, a week before BuzzFeed News published another story, Edwards allegedly exchanged 541 encrypted messages with the journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Pullquote Pullquote--right&quot; data-reactid=&quot;217&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI also extracted data from Winner’s laptop. It discovered that she had downloaded Tor Browser on February 1, 2017, and had used it in February and March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;219&quot; readability=&quot;71.836148222838&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court documents don’t name the messaging app that was used, and it’s not clear how the government obtained the metadata. However, it could not have gotten the metadata by directly monitoring the internet traffic coming from Edwards’s phone, so it is most likely that the government ordered a messaging service to supply real-time metadata, and the service complied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Signal, said his app wasn’t responsible. “Signal is designed to be privacy-preserving and collects as little information as possible,” Marlinspike told The Intercept. “In addition to end-to-end encryption for every message, Signal does not have any record of a user’s contacts, the groups they are in, the titles or avatars of any group, or the profile names or avatars of users. Even GIF searches are protected. Most of the time, Signal’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/&quot;&gt;Sealed Sender technology&lt;/a&gt; means that we don’t even know who is messaging who. Every government request we’ve ever responded to is &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/bigbrother/&quot;&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; on our website along with our response, in which it’s possible to see that the data we’re capable of providing a third party is practically nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for WhatsApp said that they can’t comment on individual cases and pointed to a section of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/general/26000050&quot;&gt;frequently asked questions&lt;/a&gt; about responding to law enforcement requests. The document states that WhatsApp “may collect, use, preserve, and share user information if we have a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary” to “respond to legal process, or to government requests.” According to Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://transparency.facebook.com/government-data-requests/country/US&quot;&gt;transparency report&lt;/a&gt;, which includes requests for WhatsApp user data, during the last half of 2018, which was when the pen register order against Edwards’s phone became operational, Facebook received 4,904 “Pen Register / Trap &amp;amp; Trace” requests, asking for data from 6,193 users, and responded with “some data” to 92 percent of the requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment but referenced the section of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/law-enforcement-guidelines-us.pdf&quot;&gt;legal process guidelines&lt;/a&gt; about the type of data related to iMessage that &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/09/28/apple-logs-your-imessage-contacts-and-may-share-them-with-police/&quot;&gt;Apple can provide&lt;/a&gt; to law enforcement. “iMessage communications are end-to-end encrypted and Apple has no way to decrypt iMessage data when it is in transit between devices,” the guidelines state. “Apple cannot intercept iMessage communications and Apple does not have iMessage communication logs.” Apple does, however, acknowledge having “iMessage capability query logs,” which indicate that an app on one user’s Apple device has begun the process of sending a message to another user’s iMessage account. &lt;span&gt;“iMessage capability query logs do not indicate that any communication between users actually took place&lt;/span&gt;,” the guidelines say. “&lt;span&gt;iMessage capability query logs are retained up to 30 days. iMessage capability query logs, if available, may be obtained with an order under 18 U.S.C. §2703(d) or court order with the equivalent legal standard or search warrant.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI also ordered Edwards’s personal cellphone carrier to hand over her phone records; the bureau did the same with a colleague of hers, whom it referred to as a “co-conspirator.” The FBI obtained a search warrant for Edwards’s personal email account, mostly likely Gmail, and from that, accessed her “internet search history” records (she is accused of searching for multiple articles based on her alleged leaks shortly after they were published). The FBI got a search warrant to physically search her person, and it seized a USB flash drive, as well as her personal cellphone. According to the criminal complaint, the flash drive contained 24,000 files, including thousands of documents describing suspicious financial transactions. The bureau extracted the messaging app data from her phone, allowing agents to read the content of the messages she allegedly exchanged with the journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards faces up to 10 years in prison. She has pleaded not guilty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These databases track what each user does: which terms they search for, which documents they click on, which ones they download to their computers, and exactly when. IRS official John Fry had access to multiple law enforcement databases, including one run by Palantir, as well as FinCEN’s database — the same one from which Edwards is accused of leaking suspicious activity reports.
&lt;p&gt;This past February, the Justice Department indicted Fry for allegedly providing details about suspicious financial transactions involving Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to prominent attorney Michael Avenatti and at least one journalist, the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow. In one of these transactions, Cohen had paid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/michael-cohen-shell-company-payments.html&quot;&gt;$130,000 of hush money&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the 2016 election to an adult film actress in exchange for her silence about an affair she says she had with Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 4, 2018, at 2:54 p.m., Fry allegedly searched the Palantir database for information related to Cohen and downloaded five suspicious activity reports, according to court documents. The same day, Fry allegedly conducted several searches for specific documents in the FinCEN database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI obtained Fry’s phone records from his personal cellphone carrier. After downloading suspicious activity reports related to Cohen, Fry allegedly called Avenatti on the phone. Later, he allegedly called a journalist and spoke for 42 minutes. The FBI then obtained a search warrant for Fry’s phone. Between May 12 and June 8, 2018, Fry allegedly exchanged 57 WhatsApp messages with the journalist. After the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/missing-files-motivated-the-leak-of-michael-cohens-financial-records&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; was published, he allegedly texted, “Beautifully written, as I suspected it would be.” The journalist’s cellphone number was allegedly in Fry’s cellphone contact list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fry faces up to five years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;aniel Hale was&lt;/u&gt; ideologically opposed to war before he joined the military in 2009, when he was 21 years old, but he felt he had no choice. “I was homeless, I was desperate, I had nowhere else to go. I was on my last leg, and the Air Force was ready to accept me,” he said in “National Bird,” a 2016 documentary about drone warfare whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent the next five years working in the drone program for the NSA, the Joint Special Operations Task Force in Afghanistan, and as a defense contractor assigned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. His job included helping identify targets to be assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hale is also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/10/trump_steps_up_war_on_whistleblowers&quot;&gt;outspoken&lt;/a&gt; activist. “The most disturbing thing about my involvement in drones is the uncertainty if anybody that I was involved in kill[ing] or captur[ing] was a civilian or not,” he said in the film. “There’s no way of knowing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, the Justice Department charged Hale with espionage for allegedly leaking classified documents related to drone warfare to a news organization identified by Trump administration officials as The Intercept, which published a series of stories in 2015 that provide the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/&quot;&gt;most detail ever made public&lt;/a&gt; about the U.S. government’s assassination program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;225&quot; readability=&quot;31.817026683609&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In an indictment unsealed on May 9, the government alleges that documents on the U.S. drone program were leaked to a news organization,” Intercept Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2019/05/09/statement-on-the-indictment-of-alleged-drone-strike-whistleblower/&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about Hale’s indictment. “These documents detailed a secret, unaccountable process for targeting and killing people around the world, including U.S. citizens, through drone strikes. They are of vital public importance, and activity related to their disclosure is protected by the First Amendment. The alleged whistleblower faces up to 50 years in prison. No one has ever been held accountable for killing civilians in drone strikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 8, 2014, dozens of FBI agents raided Hale’s house with guns drawn and searched his computer and flash drives. This all happened during the Obama administration, which declined to file charges. Five years later, Trump’s Justice Department revived the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court documents, investigators could see the exact search terms that Hale allegedly typed into different computers he used, one for unclassified work and the other for classified work, and when. The evidence against him includes quotes from text messages that Hale allegedly sent to his friends and quotes from text and email conversations he allegedly had with a journalist who media outlets have identified as The Intercept’s Jeremy Scahill. It describes his phone call metadata. It alleges that he went to an event at a bookstore and sat next to the journalist. All of these things occurred before he had allegedly sent any documents to the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;235&quot; readability=&quot;47&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between September 2013 and February 2014, according to the indictment, Hale and the journalist allegedly “had at least three encrypted conversations via Jabber,” a type of online chat service. It’s unclear where the government got this information; it could have been from internet surveillance, from the Jabber chat service provider, or from analyzing Hale’s computer. And as in the Winner and Albury cases, the FBI knew exactly which documents Hale had allegedly printed and when. Hale allegedly printed 32 documents, at least 17 of which were later published by the news organization “in whole or in part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the FBI raided Hale’s house, agents allegedly found an unclassified document on his computer and a secret document on a USB stick that Hale had “attempted to delete.” They also found another USB stick that contained Tails, an operating system designed to keep data and internet activity private and anonymous and can be booted off a USB stick, though it does not appear that the FBI gathered any data from it. In Hale’s cellphone contacts, agents allegedly found the journalist’s phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hale, who is now 31, faces a maximum of 50 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;ven though the odds&lt;/u&gt; are stacked against sources who want to remain anonymous, it’s not hopeless. Different sources face wildly different risks. If you work for a company like Google, Facebook, or Goldman Sachs, you might be under intense scrutiny on your work devices while your personal devices remain outside the reach of your employer’s surveillance (so long as you don’t rely on services it controls to communicate with journalists). And some government sources may have ways of accessing secret documents whose disclosure is in the public interest that don’t involve generating a log entry with a time stamp and associating their username with that access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s increasingly clear that the primary evidence used against whistleblowers comes from events that happened before they contacted the media, or even before they made the decision to blow the whistle. But it’s still critical that journalists are prepared to protect their sources as best as they can in case a whistleblower reaches out to them. This includes running systems like SecureDrop, which gives sources secure, metadata-free ways to make first contact with journalists and minimizes traces of the contact on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;237&quot; readability=&quot;55&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists should also take steps to reduce the amount of information about their communication with sources that tech companies can access, and that ends up on their sources’ devices, by always using encrypted messaging apps instead of insecure text messages and always using the disappearing messages feature in those apps. They should also encourage their sources not to add them to the contacts in their phone, which might get synced to Google or Apple servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journalistic process of verifying the authenticity of documents also carries risk to anonymous sources, but that process is essential to establish that the material has not been falsified or altered, and to maintain credibility with readers. Authentication, which often involves sharing information about the contents of a forthcoming story with the government, is a common journalistic practice that allows the government to weigh in on any risks involved in publishing the material of which the journalist may not be aware. By turning that process into a trap for journalists and sources, the government is sacrificing an opportunity to safeguard its legitimate interests and tell its side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News organizations also need to make hard decisions about what to publish. Sometimes, they may decide that it is safer to not publish documents if the story can be reported by describing the contents of the documents and leaving it ambiguous where the revelations came from. However, these approaches diminish transparency with readers and can also limit the impact of a story, which is important to both journalists and whistleblowers. In an era when the label “fake news” is used to discredit serious investigative journalism, original source documents serve as powerful evidence to refute such charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-shortcode-type=&quot;dropcap&quot; class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;ncrypted messaging apps&lt;/u&gt; have made significant progress in securing conversations online, but they still have major issues when it comes to protecting sources. Many, including WhatsApp and Signal, encourage users to add the phone numbers of people they message to their contacts, which often get synced to the cloud, and WhatsApp encourages users to back up their text message history to the cloud. Although Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, doesn’t have access to the content of those backed-up messages, Google and Apple do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not enough that these apps encrypt messages. They also need to do better at promptly deleting data that’s no longer needed. End-to-end encryption protects messages as they travel from one phone to another, but each phone still has a copy of the plain text of all these messages, leaving them vulnerable to physical device searches. Disappearing messages features are a great start, but they need to be improved. Users should have the option to automatically have all their chats disappear without having to remember to set disappearing messages each time they start a conversation, and they should be asked if they’d like to enable this when they first set up the app. And when all messages in a conversation disappear, all forensic traces that a conversation with that person happened should disappear too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era when the label “fake news” is used to discredit serious investigative journalism, original source documents serve as powerful evidence to refute such charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;240&quot; readability=&quot;47.074153450493&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also much more work to be done on protecting metadata. Signal’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/&quot;&gt;sealed sender&lt;/a&gt;” feature, which encrypts much of the metadata that the Signal service has access to, goes further than any other popular messaging app, but it’s still not perfect. Messaging apps need to engineer their services so that they cannot access any metadata about their users, including IP addresses. If services don’t have access to that metadata, then they can’t be compelled to hand it over to the FBI during a leak investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, web browsers keep a detailed history of every webpage you ever visit. They should really stop doing this. Why not only retain a month of browser history by default, and allow power users to change a setting if they want more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Tor Browser is the best web browser for protecting user privacy. Not only does it never keep a history of anything that happens in it, but it also routes all internet traffic through an anonymity network and uses technology to combat a tracking technique called “browser fingerprinting,” so that the websites you visit don’t know anything about you either. Unfortunately, simply having Tor Browser or other privacy-specific tools installed on a computer has been used as evidence against alleged whistleblowers. This is one reason I’m excited about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3075448/firefox-tor-super-private-browsing-mode&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s plan&lt;/a&gt; to integrate Tor directly into Firefox as a “super private browsing” mode. In the future, instead of downloading Tor Browser, sources could simply use a feature built into Firefox to get the same level of protection. Maybe Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge should follow Mozilla’s lead here. (The privacy-oriented browser Brave &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/tor-tabs-beta/&quot;&gt;already supports&lt;/a&gt; private Tor windows.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, tech giants that amass our private data through services like Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, Google Drive, iCloud, Facebook, and Dropbox should store less information about everyone to begin with, and encrypt more of the data they do store in ways that they themselves can’t access and therefore, can’t hand to the FBI. Some companies do this for certain categories of data — Apple doesn’t have the ability to access the passwords stored in your iCloud Keychain, and Google cannot access your synced Chrome profiles — but it’s not nearly enough. I’m not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>There is no evil like reCAPTCHA</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thestoic.me/there-is-no-evil-like-recaptcha</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Like many things that starts out as a mere annoyance, though eventually growing into somewhat of an &lt;em&gt;affliction&lt;/em&gt;. One particularly dark and insidious thing has more than reared its ugly head in recent years, and now far more accurately described as an epidemic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about the filth that is reCAPTCHA. Yes that seemingly harmless question of “Are you a human?” Truly I wish all this called for were sarcastic puns of 'The Matrix' variety but the matter is far more serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google describes reCAPTCHA as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[reCAPTCHA] is a free security service that protects your websites from spam and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this couldn't be further from the truth, as reCAPTCHA is actually something that causes abuse. In fact, I would go so far as to say that being subjected to constant reCAPTCHAs is actually an act of human torture and disregard for a person's human right of mental comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 90s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://aka-your-token-script-kiddies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bunch of smartasses&lt;/a&gt; realised that money was to be made and much time saved by programming bots to do everything for them online. Some bots were good and helpful and finished things quickly and easily for everyone involved and others were used to send spam and even caused some websites to crash or suffer lag due to repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time websites employed easily defeated methods for trying to prevent such abuse by making anyone who visited/accessed &lt;em&gt;'x'&lt;/em&gt; do &lt;em&gt;'y'&lt;/em&gt; thing. Mostly these preventative methods were something stupidly easy for even a computer/bot to solve and did little to stop spam and misuse except prevent access from those only computers/bots that didn't have a method of solving such simple problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve what was (at the time) an epidemic in and of itself of bots, reCRA&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;CHA was born. Google came to the rescue of all, as was arguably their responsibility because they were the ones taking it up the rear the hardest from such bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First they didn't really do a better job than anyone before them. The below example is what you were tasked with solving, which in hindsight seems fair enough, though in reality – it's incredulous to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ifu0x7T.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;firstrecaptcha&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was time for Google to get “smart” and being Google, of course they realised they could kill two birds with one stone. So they came up with a way that almost no one was able to criticise them. They turned to making people solve reCAPTCHAs that were actually helping transcribe written works into digital format, searchable by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OCR&lt;/a&gt; (Optical Character Recognition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I talking about? Well do you remember the days when a reCAPTCHA suddenly went from looking like gobbledegook to looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aIgDbJC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;earlyrecaptcha&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I do. I solved thousands of these myself. A simple quick single or double word combination which could also be played out via audio. Mildly annoying but quick and simple for humans, and apparently hard for computers. Except when it became trivial for computers. So Google had to up the ante.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.564971751412&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It started out as the lesser of two evils, the good guy vs the bad guys. Except now the fight has evolved into a level of complete disregard for humanity thanks to the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://anti-captcha.com/mainpage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these barstads&lt;/a&gt;. Yep that's exactly what it looks like. A “Professional” company that literally EMPLOYS PEOPLE TO SOLVE OTHER PEOPLE'S reCAPTCHAs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh wait it can't be that ba-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2captcha.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azcaptcha.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://expertdecoders.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cOuGh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and the list &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertdecoders.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;goes on&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://decaptchaocr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;and on&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://captchacoder.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;and on&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to meet &lt;em&gt;the resistance&lt;/em&gt; in battle? Well, fast-forward to now and you've this disease that is reCAPTCHA &lt;strong&gt;v3&lt;/strong&gt;. The piece of crap that you now find front-and-fucking-center of every single login/register page or text/form submission on the web. That beast that 'blocks your path' every time you want to need to login or write anything online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 and 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynomapper.com/blog/514-online-captcha-solving-services-and-available-captcha-types&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the average time to solve one of these annoyances was a mere 8 seconds for most people&lt;/a&gt;. I personally could do them in about 2-3 if I'd had my coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.5042372881356&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, people are doing studies on how long it takes different types of people to solve them. Such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291019809_Distinguishing_Humans_from_Automated_Programs_by_a_novel_Audio-based_CAPTCHA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Though mind you, it's from back in 2015 where you could solve these in seconds with both hands tied behind your back&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE AVERAGE TIME IS OVER 30 SECONDS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't for one second think that it has anything to do with some increasing level of complexity in the war against bots. No no no. How long it takes to now solve these things has increased due to completely deliberate and specific choices that Google has made in reCAPTCHA &lt;em&gt;v3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about why, despite you being a completely normal human being of sound deductive capability. You... just... keep... FAILING these things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why... &lt;em&gt;whyyyy&lt;/em&gt; does this happen? It isn't because you are in fact a dunce who cannot count up to 3 or cannot tell how many buses or traffic lights there are in a few blurry photos and it also isn't because you don't know what a fire hydrant looks like. The reason that people fail reCAPTCHA v3 prompts so consistently now is because Google realised there was no punishment to &lt;strong&gt;forcing people&lt;/strong&gt; to solve more of these 'human verification puzzles' and only more to gain by forcing (yes it IS forcing) people to train their AI for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People whine non-stop about hidden crypto-miners in websites but those are in fact a far more honest version of the kind of beast reCAPTCHA is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short. GREED is the reason why you are doomed to fail at least 2 to 3 times every time one of these blocks your path. In fairer times it used to be that if you had recently finished one, Google could tell and you would be able to outright skip any additional annoying puzzle or prompt after you had recently finished one already. It used to be that Google recorded a bit of your mouse movements and any other inputs you made and if those were 'human enough' you were spared the expense and agony of having to dance like a monkey to a tune. But no more. There are no short-cuts now. No free passes. It doesn't matter if you're logged into your Google account and allowing all manner of cookies. Google, despite its ability to track you even through every single reCAPTCHA prompt. They STILL force you to solve these things even though they know damn well you're not a robot. Why? Because fuck you, that's why!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now hit such a dystopian phase in internet history that some people are in the business of hiring humans to sit in front of a screen and just solve other people's reCAPTCHA prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are only set to get worse too. When we hit reCAPTCHA v4 and beyond the time that it takes to solve these prompts will arguably get longer and the tasks become more frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will likely be asked to turn on your webcam to confirm you are a human, and not in fact a pesky cat that just stepped onto the keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will likely be asked to enable access to your microphone and forced to sing the chorus to the likes of Billy Ray Cyrus' – Achy Breaky Heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will likely be asked to open your phone/iPad/whatever and perform some action on a device other than the one you are trying to solve the reCAPTCHA on -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;all begging the question of “I mean do you &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; I mean &lt;em&gt;reeaaally&lt;/em&gt; need to login or submit that post? What if you try later... &lt;del&gt;maybe it will just go away?&lt;/del&gt; If only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU WILL &lt;strong&gt;WANT&lt;/strong&gt; TO PAY A COMPANY TO SOLVE THESE THINGS FOR YOU. BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT! Solving reCAPTCHAs will be just another LUXURY like fast download and upload speeds, 4K displays and toilet paper that doesn't give you a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hold up, if you don't think that before you start to even consider that there must be a way to bypass or block these things just like you can block an advertisement online. Leading you to find one of those aforementioned 'solving services' and actually ever sign up to one of them. That there will, and, not &lt;strong&gt;LONG&lt;/strong&gt;, before you ever could get to that stage, be an option to PAY GOOGLE THEMSELVES some form of subscription to bypass these things altogether. If such a thing sounds like a fairytale to you, my dear reader, you are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; naïve. I call it the &lt;strong&gt;reCAPTCHA Pass&lt;/strong&gt; I dare say it's already in the works and that, if you value your time, you will want one. With Google controlling the supply, demand and complexity of these bloody things, you can bet that their prices will be the cheapest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really I'm surprised there isn't a freaking crypto 'credit' service that exists that you can use to pay your way out of having to do them. Now wait, that's an idea! BRB whilst I go patent that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark. My. Words. It will only get worse and there will be multiple businesses and services available pining for your money. &lt;em&gt;'When computers attack'&lt;/em&gt; the only thing that can solve the question of “Are you a human?” is literally exactly that, a human. Either you, or some poor sod you are paying. So what's it gonna be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/alMNa4L.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;joke&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's my turn now but you won't take me alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thestoic.me/tag:personal&quot; class=&quot;hashtag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-category&quot;&gt;personal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;c659&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;BlazingSQL is not a database, which is why we changed our original name of BlazingDB to BlazingSQL. It is a SQL engine that processes (almost) any data you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8cfa&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;Working within &lt;a href=&quot;https://rapids.ai&quot; class=&quot;dg ca lw lx ly lz&quot;&gt;RAPIDS&lt;/a&gt; has been game-changing. There are now over 100 developers contributing to our community. Most of these developers come from enterprise and their contributions add valuable features to BlazingSQL, like support for more file formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6f13&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;As RAPIDS adoption continues to explode, open-sourcing BlazingSQL accelerates our development cycle, gets our product in the hands of more users, and aligns our licensing and messaging with the greater RAPIDS.ai ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;ma&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;b6cf&quot; class=&quot;mb mc md aw jh b jy me mf mg mh mi lv&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jh b mj mk ba&quot;&gt;“NVIDIA and the RAPIDS ecosystem are delighted that BlazingSQL is open-sourcing their SQL engine built on RAPIDS,” said Josh Patterson, GM of data science at NVIDIA. “By leveraging Apache Arrow on GPUs and integrating with Dask, BlazingSQL will extend open-source functionality, and drive the next wave of interoperability in the accelerated data science ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e5a&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll ml ln mm lp mn lr mo lt mp lv&quot;&gt;We went all-in on RAPIDS before it had a name. Now, open-sourcing is the culmination of a strategy by NVIDIA and BlazingSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b497&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;NVIDIA stepped up to ensure RAPIDS would solve customer problems at scale. BlazingSQL, in addition to contributing heavily to the RAPIDS ecosystem, will focus on the services and support agreements necessary to make RAPIDS + BlazingSQL deployments successful and accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b7b1&quot; class=&quot;mq mr do aw av dm ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc&quot;&gt;Customer Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6b10&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll nd ln ne lp nf lr ng lt nh lv&quot;&gt;When we talk about challenges our customers are facing around their analytics pipelines we hear the same complaints over and over; processing data at scale is expensive, slow, and incredibly complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;1241&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;BlazingSQL addresses these customer concerns not only with an incredibly fast, distributed GPU SQL engine, but also a zealous focus on simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0454&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;With a few lines of code, BlazingSQL can query your raw data, wherever it resides and interoperate with your existing analytics stack and RAPIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;16b4&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll nd ln ne lp nf lr ng lt nh lv&quot;&gt;RAPIDS is the next-generation analytics ecosystem. SQL forms a fundamental pillar of every major analytics ecosystem to date, and BlazingSQL is the SQL standard for RAPIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7272&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;For this reason, we are fully integrated with the greater RAPIDS team and contribute heavily to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3AwilliamBlazing+is%3Aclosed+&quot; class=&quot;dg ca lw lx ly lz&quot;&gt;cuDF&lt;/a&gt;. BlazingSQL is built entirely on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf&quot; class=&quot;dg ca lw lx ly lz&quot;&gt;cuDF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/tree/branch-0.9/cpp/src/io&quot; class=&quot;dg ca lw lx ly lz&quot;&gt;cuIO&lt;/a&gt;. New features pushed to these projects directly impact BlazingSQL features and performance, and because BlazingSQL runs on GDFs it is 100% interoperable with all of RAPIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5cd1&quot; class=&quot;li lj do aw lk b ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu lv&quot;&gt;Something we wish to make very clear, if you are a user of RAPIDS, or are considering RAPIDS (which you honestly should), you need to check out BlazingSQL and add it to your stack. BlazingSQL offers RAPIDS users countless benefits, not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I Turned Down an AWS Job Offer</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I have some modicum of credibility when I talk about AWS is that I strive for fairness. When I say something AWS has done is good, people believe me because I’ll also call out when something else they’ve done is garbage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is one of those days where I call out something terrible about AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the news broke that Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-sues-former-aws-exec-joining-rival-google-division-cloud-wars-escalate/&quot;&gt;has sued a former AWS executive&lt;/a&gt; for violating the non-compete clause of his employment agreement. &lt;s&gt;Geekwire being Geekwire they didn’t link to the actual complaint from the lawsuit, apparently preferring muckraking to actual journalism.&lt;/s&gt; [After publication they reached out to correct me; they did indeed embed the complaint at the end of their article. The management regrets the error.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I have stepped up and rectified that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most folks don’t enjoy reading through court documents nearly as much as I do, allow me to summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Phillip Moyer (a random sales schmoo) worked at AWS selling cloud services. He quit and went to go work for Google to sell their cloud services instead. Amazon pitched a shitfit and is suing him in King County Superior Court, asking for the non-compete to be enforced for at least the original 18 months and also for the schmoo to pay them money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a little background on this, it helps to understand that all U.S.-based Amazon employees who don’t live in California (where employee rights are protected more vigorously than in other places) agree to a clause in their employment agreement, known as a “non-compete.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the court filing, it reads as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Competition. During employment and for 18 months after the Separation Date, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, whether on Employee’s own behalf or on behalf of any other entity (for example, as an employee, agent, partner, or consultant), engage in or support the development, manufacture, marketing, or sale of any product or service that competes or is intended to compete with any product or service sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon (or intended to be sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon in the future) that Employee worked on or supported, or about which Employee obtained or received Confidential Information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clause is, to be direct, abusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it’s scoped to Amazon—not just AWS. If someone signs an agreement to this effect, what possible job could they take after leaving Amazon that wouldn’t potentially run afoul of this clause? I’d have said “writing a newsletter making fun of AWS,” but—lo and behold—they’re already in the business of making fun of themselves by launching services with names like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html&quot;&gt;Systems Manager Session Manager&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few points I want to emphasize here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The most common argument made in favor of broad non-competition clauses like this one goes something like this: Employees are privy to highly confidential information and new employers shouldn’t be able to commit backdoor corporate espionage by hiring their people away. This argument, of course, ignores the fact that confidentiality agreements in employment agreements are *fully enforceable* in every U.S. state (whether or not the information in question qualifies as a trade secret a la the formula to Coke) and don’t have the additional negative effect of preventing people from earning a living. When a company chooses to use a non-compete, it’s not about protecting their top-secret strategy—in this case “build a lot of things that customers like and sell them as services!”—it’s about control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Amazon reached out to said schmoo’s new employer to negotiate what he’d be allowed to work on. Can you imagine accepting a new job and then freaking Amazon calls your new boss to threaten them as a result? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. This is very clearly about AWS trying to send a message to GCP. Unfortunately, it’s being conducted through a lawsuit against some random sales schmoo in Pennsylvania. Moyer doesn’t represent Google any more than he represented Amazon during his tenure there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about this for quite a while, because this exact clause is why I rejected an otherwise extremely compelling offer to work at AWS in a role that was uniquely suited to me back in 2018. Amazon wouldn’t budge on this point, and during our discussions a number of people (both officially and not) gave a few reasons to accept the clause that were piquantly scented with Amazon-flavored bullshit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“We need this to protect our business.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating. As I’ve stated already, these clauses are non-enforceable in California and have been since 1850 when the state was formed (this point is often cited as why Silicon Valley is even a thing). Not to belabor the point, but AWS has many employees in California already, and so does Google—as does nearly every other tech company of note. They’ve done all right for themselves. Further, any employee subject to one of these agreements who moves to California finds themselves no longer bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get that you want to “protect your business.” I want to be able to feed my family when I eventually leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“It’s never enforced.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then don’t ask me to sign it. I have this bizarre belief that I live by the agreements I make. If I’m not prepared to live by them, I don’t sign them. Also, it’s clearly being enforced &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7975428&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teamblind.com/article/Amazon-18-month-Non-Compete-HsPCYgsu&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2014/amazon-sues-employee-taking-google-cloud-job-new-test-non-compete-laws/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-sues-former-aws-vp-non-compete-deal-smartsheet-calls-claim-new-product-chief-enormous-overreach/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as I was drafting this post a tweet thread on how this is sprung on people unexpectedly was published. Take care to read the thread; in this case they wound up not enforcing it, but required an existing employee to agree to it after they’d already moved him from Ireland to Seattle on a visa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; readability=&quot;9.5569620253165&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Some people are saying that these clauses are known upfront before joining. Well, that wasn’t the case for me when I joined Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you how Amazon squeezed non-competitive clauses into my contract about 2 years into my job in a very unethical manner: 👇&lt;/p&gt;
— Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1157729616259235840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 3, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“We’d never enforce it against someone who’s not a VP.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales schmoo they’re currently suing was likewise not a VP. Also, see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“No, we will not pay your salary for the duration of the non-compete, nor will we elect to do that only if we choose to enforce the agreement.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gardening-leave.asp&quot;&gt;non-competes work in parts of Europe&lt;/a&gt;. They basically laughed me out of the room at the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“We’ve only ever enforced it when someone burns bridges on their way out of the company.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you met me? I had to burn a bridge then pole-vault over it to get an interview at AWS! I’m supposed to trust in my ability to one day leave an employer where I haven’t severely pissed off at least one VP? As of this writing, I have to my knowledge severely pissed off exactly three AWS VPs &lt;em&gt;and I don’t even work there!&lt;/em&gt; (Aside: If you’re a VP at AWS who hates me and isn’t sure if I know that, please get in touch and I’ll increment that counter if I wasn’t already aware!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Well, why not just stay in California and work in the local office?”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the only remote member of a team, your impact is inherently limited. In my experience, either the entire team is remote or else the remote members are second-class citizens. Thus, this could be reframed as “why not damage your chances of success before you even start?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that I could turn down the offer is an expression of immense privilege. Not everyone has that privilege. There is in no way, shape, or form an equal balance of power between a prospective employee and a trillion-dollar company. Full stop. Much less one that apparently will sue former employees out of spite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best and brightest people that I know are AWS employees. None of them deserve something like this to happen to them whenever their turn to leave comes up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on, AWS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do better than this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be better than this. &lt;/p&gt;
