<title>I Can’t Stop Winning</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;blog_title&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.pinboard.in/2019/07/i_cant_stop_winning/&quot;&gt;I Can't Stop Winning!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinboard is ten years old! I launched the site in July 9, 2009 from a small kitchen in Botoșani, Romania. My very first support email angrily demanded a refund, setting the tone for the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet back then was different. HTTPS was a luxury good. You could buy products and services with Bitcoin. Things in the tech industry hadn't consolidated down to an oligopoly—Yahoo was still a going concern, as was AOL and LiveJournal. The 'big 3' in tech were HP, IBM, and Motorola, with Microsoft the only software company in the top 10. Pillows were fluffier. Food tasted better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that a decade has passed, I thought I would have some Yoda-like business wisdom to impart, but I don't. It feels just like last year. The journey of 10,000 steps begins with 9,999 steps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandpa sometimes said &quot;you have to help your fate along,&quot; and I always liked this worldview very much, for the way it bolted a work ethic onto fatalism. Things happen, but you can always take credit for tenacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-person business is an exercise in long-term anxiety management, so I would say if you are already an anxious person, go ahead and start a business. You're not going to feel any worse. You've already got the main skill set of staying up and worrying, so you might as well make some money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running an online service solo puts one in the coffin corner between the Dunning Kruger effect and impostor syndrome. On some days you feel the correct but paralyzing sense that you are in way over your head. On other days, you'll feel like you're surfing on waves of liquid competence, doing flips, until you destroy something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between the two is a zone of narrow, focused productivity that I hope one day to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year I post stats, except last year, when I forgot. (I will update the 2018 stats in the table below when I find them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gist of it is, there are more bookmarks, more URLs, more of everything except users. That is because I spent all of 2017 doing tech organizing, and then all of 2018 fundraising for the Congressional elections, and customers grew irate. Now I am trying to win them back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the future hold for Pinboard? Death! The bus that one day comes for us all! The skeletal, icy hand on an unprepared shoulder! Pain, a flash of light, then numbing darkness. So back up your bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this happy day, there are three people I would like to especially thank:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.1510297482838&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Schachter&lt;/strong&gt;, for giving me the moral blessing to clone Delicious while it was still a going concern, and for contributing invaluable ideas (like the URL schema and pricing model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.3951612903226&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Gadjokov&lt;/strong&gt;, who co-founded the site with me, came up with the name, and helped me through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pinboard.in/2011/03/anatomy_of_a_crushing/&quot;&gt;insanity of December 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;Britta Gustafson&lt;/strong&gt;, who introduced me to fandom and showed me how they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlewords.com/talks/fan_is_a_tool_using_animal.htm&quot;&gt;created an entire world of their own&lt;/a&gt; on Delicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, all three of these people are from the earliest days of Delicious, and I am happy that the community they created in 2003 can in some way live on in the very different internet of 2019, biding its time until things can be fun again. I am grateful to them all, and grateful to the people who use this website, hopefully for many decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Camera and microphone require HTTPS in Firefox 68</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/camera-microphone-require-https-in-firefox-68/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/camera-microphone-require-https-in-firefox-68/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;July 1, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Contributed by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/webrtc/camera-microphone-require-https-in-firefox-68/&quot;&gt;Jan-Ivar Bruaroey&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Firefox 68—releasing next week—camera and microphone will require an &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; connection to work. Access from insecure &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; will cease to work, matching how Chrome works. Camera and microhone are powerful features, and Firefox will now only expose them in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts&quot;&gt;secure contexts&lt;/a&gt;, a security and privacy improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largely an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/getusermedia-and-enumeratedevices-can-no-longer-be-used-on-insecure-sites/&quot;&gt;issue for developers to catch up on&lt;/a&gt;, this may nonetheless affect end users who follow old &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; links to servers that either still don’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security&quot;&gt;redirect their users&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; automatically, or don’t support it at all. If you’re experiencing this problem, click your URL bar, and if the URL starts with &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt;, try changing it to &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;, and it should work again, provided the server supports https.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this blog post is for web developers, since there are some details that may be of interest to them. Firefox is deprecating camera and microphone access in insecure contexts in two steps: &lt;span id=&quot;more-409&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Firefox 68 behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Firefox 68, &lt;code&gt;getUserMedia&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/68#APIs&quot;&gt;will throw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;NotAllowedError&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;enumerateDevices&lt;/code&gt; will continue to work until Firefox 69. This matches how Chrome has worked for a good while (pre Chrome 74), and should be highly web compatible. It is an intermediate stepping stone to Firefox 69.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Firefox 69 behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Firefox 69, both &lt;code&gt;getUserMedia&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;enumerateDevices&lt;/code&gt; will throw &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt;. This matches how Chrome 74+ and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#idl-def-mediadevices&quot;&gt;the spec&lt;/a&gt; now work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth pointing out that this &lt;code&gt;TypeError&lt;/code&gt; exception will come from the absence of the &lt;code&gt;navigator.mediaDevices&lt;/code&gt; object in insecure contexts—or, if callbacks are used, the absence of the deprecated &lt;code&gt;navigator.mozGetUserMedia&lt;/code&gt; function. Any JavaScript that doesn’t test for this before invoking &lt;code&gt;navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()&lt;/code&gt; will get an immediate exception thrown instead of merely having its promise rejected. Compared to Firefox 68, this might affect surrounding code, hence the two-step process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How SecureContext improves things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good news for web developers is that camera and microphone will continue to work from &lt;code&gt;http://localhost&lt;/code&gt;! This is thanks to the modern definition of secure context, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#localhost&quot;&gt;defines local sources as secure&lt;/a&gt;. It also fixes other edge cases, like an &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; iframe in an &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; page is now considered insecure. It also cleans up camera and microphone access from embedded JS using &lt;code&gt;srcdoc&lt;/code&gt; (works) and &lt;code&gt;data:&lt;/code&gt; URLs (no longer works).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple kills the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/09/apple-macbook-air-macbook-pro-updates/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/09/apple-macbook-air-macbook-pro-updates/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The 13-inch base MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is now a much more compelling buy, at least if you like Apple's current input methods. There's finally a quad-core, 8th-generation Intel chip inside (either a 1.4GHz Core i5 or an optional 1.7GHz Core i7), and all models now have both the Touch Bar and Touch ID -- there's no longer a legacy keyboard for those who insist on dedicated function keys. That also means you're getting the T2 chip and &quot;immersive&quot; speakers. A True Tone display upgrade comes along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't expect other overhauls, though. The Pro still starts at $1,299 ($1,199 for students) with 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and two Thunderbolt 3 ports ($1,499 with a 256GB SSD), so you'll still have to pony up if you need more memory and storage. Look at it this way, though: you won't have to spend nearly as much to get a quad-core Mac laptop as you did in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/faster-raspberry-pi-4-promises-desktop-class-performance/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/a&gt; was announced two weeks ago as a major new upgrade to the line of cheap single-board hobbyist computers. The Pi 4 featured a faster CPU, options for up to 4GB of RAM, and a new, modern USB-C port for power delivery. The Pi 4 was the Raspberry Pi Foundation's first ever USB-C device, and, well, they screwed it up.&lt;/p&gt;

As detailed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scorpia.co.uk/2019/06/28/pi4-not-working-with-some-chargers-or-why-you-need-two-cc-resistors/&quot;&gt;Tyler Ward&lt;/a&gt;, the Raspberry Pi 4 has a non-compliant USB-C charging port and doesn't work with as many chargers as it should. Thanks to the open nature of Raspberry Pi (even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/schematics/rpi_SCH_4b_4p0_reduced.pdf&quot;&gt;the schematics&lt;/a&gt; are online!), Ward was able to discover that Raspberry Pi just didn't design its USB-C port correctly. Two &quot;CC&quot; pins on a USB-C port are supposed to each get their own 5.1K ohms resistor, but Raspberry Pi came up with its own circuit design that allows them to share a single resistor. This is not a compliant design and breaks compatibility with some of the more powerful USB-C chargers out there.
&lt;p&gt;Whether your USB-C charger works with the Pi 4 has to do with whether it uses an &quot;e-marked&quot; cable. E-marked cables are fully featured USB-C cables with chips inside that negotiate power management, accessory modes, data rates, and other communication specs. Since the Pi 4 USB-C port is wired incorrectly, these smart cables will detect the Pi 4 as an &quot;Audio Adaptor Accessory&quot; and refuse to charge them. Usually, e-marked cables are more expensive and come with larger, higher-powered items, like a USB-C laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benson Leung, an engineer at Google and one of the Internet's foremost &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/google-engineer-leaves-scathing-reviews-of-dodgy-usb-type-c-cables-on-amazon/&quot;&gt;USB-C implementation experts&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@leung.benson/how-to-design-a-proper-usb-c-power-sink-hint-not-the-way-raspberry-pi-4-did-it-f470d7a5910&quot;&gt;chimed in&lt;/a&gt; on the Pi 4's USB-C design too, with a Medium post titled &quot;How to design a proper USB-C™ power sink (hint, not the way Raspberry Pi 4 did it).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Instead of trying to come up with some clever circuit,&quot; Leung writes, &quot;hardware designers should simply &lt;em class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;copy the figure from the USB-C Spec&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; [emphasis his]&lt;em class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The Figure 4–9 I posted above isn’t simply a rough guideline of one way of making a USB-C receptacle. It’s actually &lt;strong class=&quot;gh gx&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;lp&quot;&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning mandatory, required by the spec in order to call your system a compliant USB-C power sink. Just copy it.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;The Pi 4 is not the first high-profile device to get the USB-C spec wrong. The Nintendo Switch also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190201011444/https://plus.google.com/102612254593917101378/posts/2CUPZ5yVTRT&quot;&gt;non-compliant USB-C port&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/nintendo-warns-against-using-substandard-switch-charging-cables/&quot;&gt;Nintendo has warned&lt;/a&gt; against using substandard cables with the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reports started popping up on the Internet, Raspberry Pi cofounder Eben Upton admitted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/your-new-raspberry-pi-4-wont-power-on-usb-c-cable-problem-now-officially-confirmed/&quot;&gt;TechRepublic&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;A smart charger with an e-marked cable will incorrectly identify the Raspberry Pi 4 as an audio adapter accessory and refuse to provide power.&quot; Upton went on to say, &quot;I expect this will be fixed in a future board revision, but for now users will need to apply one of the suggested workarounds. It's surprising this didn't show up in our (quite extensive) field testing program.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;suggested workarounds&quot; are to just use a non-e-marked cable, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/type-c-power-supply/&quot;&gt;official Pi 4 charger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached out to Raspberry Pi about this issue and were told a board revision with a spec-compliant charging port should be out sometime in the &quot;next few months.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ross Perot Has Died</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/billionaire-and-former-presidential-candidate-ross-perot-is-dead-at-89.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire businessman, philanthropist and independent presidential candidate Ross Perot is dead at 89, CNBC has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perot, who ran for president in 1992 and 1996, died after a five-month battle with leukemia, said James Fuller, a representative for the Perot family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In business and in life, Ross was a man of integrity and action. A true American patriot and a man of rare vision, principle and deep compassion, he touched the lives of countless people through his unwavering support of the military and veterans and through his charitable endeavors,&quot; Fuller said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perot is survived by his wife, Margot, his five children and 16 grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perot was an early tech entrepreneur. He started his career in sales at IBM, where he excelled. In 1962, he founded his first company, Electronic Data Systems, with just $1,000 in savings. More than two decades later, he launched information technology services provider Perot Systems, which was acquired in 2009 by Dell for $3.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a disruptive third-party candidate for president, Perot ran on a platform of fiscal responsibility and protectionism. He won nearly 19% of the vote in the 1992 race — by far the biggest slice of the electorate for a third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party in the 1912 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;35.594594594595&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perot stood out from the political crowd for his quirks as much as his business credentials and lack of experience in establishment politics. &quot;I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else,&quot; he said in a 1992 presidential debate. The shifting of U.S. jobs to Mexico created a &quot;giant sucking sound,&quot; he famously said during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perot participated in all three presidential debates in that election, and took a nontraditional campaign route by booking lengthy time slots on network television to lay out his political views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was &quot;certainly the most influential political force in the late 20th century from outside the regular party system,&quot; said Allan Lichtman, distinguished professor of history at American University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lichtman told CNBC he had been tapped to write a biography of Perot, and Lichtman had agreed. But &quot;quirky Ross Perot, just like he pulled out of the presidential race, he pulled out of the biography,&quot; Lichtman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perot was a veteran, and followed his service with a lifetime commitment to supporting U.S. veterans, especially during the Vietnam War. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=1640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;honored in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by then-Veterans Affairs Secretary James Peake for his advocacy efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;47.150743099788&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perot's death led to an outpouring of warmth from figures in the political world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that Perot was &quot;a true patriot and a steadfast support of our military.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President George W. Bush said in a statement to NBC News that &quot;Texas and America have lost a strong patriot&quot; in Perot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ross Perot epitomized the entrepreneurial spirit and the American creed. He gave selflessly of his time and resources to help others in our community, across our country, and around the world. He loved the U.S. military and supported our service members and veterans. Most importantly, he loved his dear wife, children, and grandchildren. Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Perot family as they celebrate a full life,&quot; Bush said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Vice President Al Gore said that he &quot;always had the utmost respect for Ross Perot, for his patriotism, love of country, and extraordinary commitment to our veterans. I send my deepest condolences to his family and to everyone who loved and admired him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his final interview with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dallasnews.com/business/business/2019/07/09/ross-perot-self-made-billionaire-patriot-philanthropist-dies-89?utm_content=buffer9cd48&amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dallas News&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, Perot shrugged off a question about his legacy, saying &quot;Aw, I don't worry about that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His parting words in that interview, however, were well considered: &quot;Texas born. Texas bred. When I die, I'll be Texas dead. Ha!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died at his home in Dallas, in the company of his family.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>France to tax flights from its airports, airline shares fall</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-airlines-tax-idUSKCN1U412B</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-airlines-tax-idUSKCN1U412B</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - France will introduce a tax on airlines flying from its airports to help support the environment, the transport minister said on Tuesday, in a move expected to raise around 180 million euros ($202 million) from 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20190709&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1406089631&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEF680P4&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;FILE PHOTO: French Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne leaves the Elysee Palace after the first weekly cabinet meeting of the year and a government seminar in Paris, France, January 3, 2018.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in airlines across Europe fell on the news, with Air France (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AIRF.PA_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AIRF.PA&quot;&gt;AIRF.PA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) down 5.2%, Ryanair (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_RYA.I_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=RYA.I&quot;&gt;RYA.I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) down 4.8%, easyJet (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_EZJ.L_2”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=EZJ.L&quot;&gt;EZJ.L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) down 4% and Lufthansa (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_LHAG.DE_3”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=LHAG.DE&quot;&gt;LHAG.DE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) down nearly 3% at 1255 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, activists said the new tax was unlikely to change consumer behavior at the proposed levels and was low compared with other countries. Brussels-based NGO Transport and Environment (T&amp;amp;E) estimates airline taxes raise about 1 billion euros per year in Germany and more than 3 billion in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new French tax will be 1.5 euros for flights within France or the European Union, 3 euros for economy flights out of the EU, 9 euros for intra-EU business class and up to 18 euros for business class tickets out of the EU. Transit flights will not be taxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have decided to put in place an eco-tax on all flights from France,” Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne told a news conference, adding proceeds would be use to finance daily transport in France, notably local trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French government also said that from 2020 it expected to raise 140 million euros from reducing tax benefits on diesel for trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government is finally targeting tax breaks for the most polluting industries such as trucking and airlines, but these modest measures will not significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Climate Action Network’s Lorelei Limousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limousin said tax exemptions for jet plane kerosene fuel cost French taxpayers more than 3.7 billion euros per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she welcomed the fact France was taking action at home, rather than waiting for an EU-wide initiative on airline tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France said last month it wanted the new European Commission to push for an end to global tax exemptions for jet fuel to reduce CO2 emissions. It has also linked up with the Netherlands to try to convince fellow European nations to tax airline travel more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air France said the new tax would significantly hurt its competitiveness and represent an additional cost of over 60 million euros per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It said 50% of its flights were operated out of France, notably for its domestic network, where losses amounted to more than 180 million euros in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French President Emmanuel Macron’s government has said it wants to put the environment at the center of its policies, but late last year it abandoned an attempt to increase tax on diesel fuel following the “yellow vest” protest movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Murphy, air travel specialist at T&amp;amp;E, said the new policy was “a more equitable tax. Driving a car is often unavoidable, but frequent flyers tend to be wealthy urbanites,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intention to fine Marriott more than £99M under GDPR for data breach</title>
<link>https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/statement-intention-to-fine-marriott-international-inc-more-than-99-million-under-gdpr-for-data-breach/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/statement-intention-to-fine-marriott-international-inc-more-than-99-million-under-gdpr-for-data-breach/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Statement in response to Marriott International, Inc’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048286/000119312519190941/d764348dex991.htm&quot;&gt;filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) intends to fine it for breaches of data protection law.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an extensive investigation the ICO has issued a notice of its intention to fine Marriott International £99,200,396 for infringements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident which was notified to the ICO by Marriott in November 2018. A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The GDPR makes it clear that organisations must be accountable for the personal data they hold. This can include carrying out proper due diligence when making a corporate acquisition, and putting in place proper accountability measures to assess not only what personal data has been acquired, but also how it is protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Personal data has a real value so organisations have a legal duty to ensure its security, just like they would do with any other asset. If that doesn’t happen, we will not hesitate to take strong action when necessary to protect the rights of the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriott has co-operated with the ICO investigation and has made improvements to its security arrangements since these events came to light. The company will now have an opportunity to make representations to the ICO as to the proposed findings and sanction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICO has been investigating this case as lead supervisory authority on behalf of other EU Member State data protection authorities. It has also liaised with other regulators. Under the GDPR ‘one stop shop’ provisions the data protection authorities in the EU whose residents have been affected will also have the chance to comment on the ICO’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICO will consider carefully the representations made by the company and the other concerned data protection authorities before it takes its final decision.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IBM Closes Acquisition of Red Hat for $34B</title>
<link>https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-closes-landmark-acquisition-red-hat-34-billion-defines-open-hybrid-cloud-future</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;location&quot;&gt;ARMONK, N.Y. and RALEIGH, N.C.&lt;/span&gt; — &lt;span class=&quot;dtstart&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-07-09T00:00:00-04:00&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot;&gt;July 9, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/span&gt; —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pr-pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining forces with IBM gives Red Hat the opportunity to bring more open source innovation to an even broader range of organizations and will enable us to scale to meet the need for hybrid cloud solutions that deliver true choice and agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pr-pullquote-name&quot;&gt;Jim Whitehurst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pr-pullquote-title&quot;&gt;president and CEO, Red Hat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquisition positions IBM as the leading hybrid cloud provider and accelerates IBM’s high-value business model, extending Red Hat’s open source innovation to a broader range of clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IBM preserves Red Hat’s independence and neutrality; Red Hat will strengthen its existing partnerships to give customers freedom, choice and flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Hat’s unwavering commitment to open source remains unchanged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Together, IBM and Red Hat will deliver next-generation hybrid multicloud platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Red Hat announced today that they have closed the transaction under which IBM acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total equity value of approximately $34 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition redefines the cloud market for business. Red Hat’s open hybrid cloud technologies are now paired with the unmatched scale and depth of IBM’s innovation and industry expertise, and sales leadership in more than 175 countries. Together, IBM and Red Hat will accelerate innovation by offering a next-generation hybrid multicloud platform. Based on open source technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes, the platform will allow businesses to securely deploy, run and manage data and applications on-premises and on private and multiple public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Businesses are starting the next chapter of their digital reinventions, modernizing infrastructure and moving mission-critical workloads across private clouds and multiple clouds from multiple vendors,&quot; said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and CEO. &quot;They need open, flexible technology to manage these hybrid multicloud environments. And they need partners they can trust to manage and secure these systems. IBM and Red Hat are uniquely suited to meet these needs. As the leading hybrid cloud provider, we will help clients forge the technology foundations of their business for decades to come.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we talk to customers, their challenges are clear: They need to move faster and differentiate through technology. They want to build more collaborative cultures, and they need solutions that give them the flexibility to build and deploy any app or workload, anywhere,&quot; said Jim Whitehurst, president and CEO, Red Hat. &quot;We think open source has become the de facto standard in technology because it enables these solutions. Joining forces with IBM gives Red Hat the opportunity to bring more open source innovation to an even broader range of organizations and will enable us to scale to meet the need for hybrid cloud solutions that deliver true choice and agility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat will continue to be led by Jim Whitehurst and its current management team. Whitehurst is joining IBM’s senior management team, reporting to Ginni Rometty. IBM will maintain Red Hat’s headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, its facilities, brands and practices. Red Hat will operate as a distinct unit within IBM and will be reported as part of IBM’s Cloud and Cognitive Software segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies have already built leading enterprise cloud businesses with consistent strong revenue growth by helping customers transition their business models to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM’s cloud revenue has grown from 4 percent of total revenue in 2013 to 25 percent today. This growth comes through a comprehensive range of as-a-service offerings and software, services and hardware that enable IBM to advise, build, move and manage cloud solutions across public, private and on-premises environments for customers. IBM cloud revenue for the 12-month period through the first quarter of this year grew to over $19 billion. The Red Hat acquisition is expected to contribute approximately two points of compound annual revenue growth to IBM over a five-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat’s fiscal year 2019 revenue was $3.4 billion, up 15 percent year-over-year. Fiscal first quarter 2020 revenue, reported in June, was $934 million, up 15 percent year-over-year. In that quarter, subscription revenue was up 15 percent year-over-year, including revenue from application development-related and other emerging technology offerings up 24 percent year-over-year. Services revenue also grew 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hybrid Cloud Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital reinvention is at an inflection point as businesses enter the next chapter of their cloud journey. Most enterprises today are approximately 20 percent into their transition to the cloud. In this first chapter of their cloud journey, businesses made great strides in reducing costs, boosting productivity and revitalizing their customer-facing innovation programs. Chapter two, however, is about shifting mission-critical workloads to the cloud and optimizing everything from supply chains to core banking systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed in the next chapter of the cloud, businesses need to manage their entire IT infrastructure, on and off-premises and across different clouds — private and public – in a way that is simple, consistent and integrated. Businesses are seeking one common environment they can build once and deploy in any one of the appropriate footprints to be faster and more agile. IBM’s offerings have evolved to reflect new customer needs and drive greater growth. The acquisition of Red Hat further strengthens IBM as the leader in hybrid cloud for the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As organizations seek to increase their pace of innovation to stay competitive, they are looking to open source and a distributed cloud environment to enable a new wave of digital innovation that wasn’t possible before. Over the next five years, IDC expects enterprises to invest heavily in their journeys to the cloud, and innovation on it. A large and increasing portion of this investment will be on open hybrid and multicloud environments that enable them to move apps, data and workloads across different environments,&quot; said Frank Gens, Senior Vice President and Chief Analyst, IDC. &quot;With the acquisition of Red Hat, and IBM’s commitment to Red Hat’s independence, IBM is well positioned to help enterprises differentiate themselves in their industry by capitalizing on open source in this emerging hybrid and multicloud world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collective ability of IBM and Red Hat to unlock the true value of hybrid cloud for businesses is already resonating among customers moving to the next chapter of digital reinvention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Delta is constantly exploring current and emerging technology as we transform the air travel experience,&quot; said Ed Bastian, Delta CEO. &quot;We’ve been working with both IBM and Red Hat for years to deliver on that goal, and as they together build the next generation IT company, they will be an essential part of our digital transformation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a long-standing partner of Red Hat and IBM, we look forward to capabilities that these two companies will bring together,&quot; said Michael Poser, Managing Director and Chief Information Officer, Enterprise Technology &amp;amp; Services, Morgan Stanley. &quot;We know first-hand how important and impactful cloud technology contributes to unlocking business value.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IBM Reinforces Commitment to Open Source and Red Hat Neutrality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Red Hat have deep open source values and experience. The two companies have worked together for more than 20 years to make open source the default choice for modern IT solutions. This includes the importance of open governance and helping open source projects and communities flourish through continued contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Red Hat, IBM has acquired one of the most important software companies in the IT industry. Red Hat’s pioneering business model helped bring open source – including technologies like Linux, Kubernetes, Ansible, Java, Ceph and many more – into the mainstream for enterprises. Today, Linux is the most used platform for development. Red Hat Enterprise Linux alone is expected to contribute to more than $10 trillion worth of global business revenues in 2019. By 2023, an additional 640,000 people are expected to work in Red Hat-related jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has committed to scaling and accelerating open source and hybrid cloud for businesses across industries, as well as preserving the independence and neutrality of Red Hat’s open source heritage. This includes its open source community leadership, contributions and development model; product portfolio, services, and go-to-market strategy; robust developer and partner ecosystems, and unique culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat’s mission and unwavering commitment to open source will remain unchanged, and Red Hat will continue to offer the choice and flexibility inherent to open source and hybrid IT environments. Red Hat also will continue to build and expand its partnerships, including those with major cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Red Hat also share a strong commitment to social responsibility and a sense of purpose for applying technology and expertise to help address some of the world’s most significant societal challenges. Together, the two companies have committed to expanding this longstanding commitment through new joint initiatives, addressing education and skills, civic and societal needs and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) workforce development.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Small video games studios are asking the public to stop buying their titles from &quot;unauthorised&quot; markets, saying the sales cost them more than they earn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several have said it would even be better if consumers pirated their games rather than purchased discounted unlock codes from the &quot;key resellers&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/game-developers-g2a-stop-selling-indie-titles-on-your-platform?use_react=false&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;label is running a petition calling on the biggest such market&lt;/a&gt; - G2A - to halt sales of indie games outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But G2A has defended its business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the indies benefited from its policy of sharing a cut of sales made by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hundreds of developers earn money from selling their keys through marketplaces such as G2A,&quot; head of communications Maciej Kuc told BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don't plan on taking away that possibility anytime soon, as it would be hurtful not only to our customers but also to the many developers who use our platform to their benefit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that G2A already took &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.g2a.com/news/latest/g2a-vows-to-pay-devs-10x-the-money-proven-to-be-lost-on-chargebacks/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;measures to tackle illegal sales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he said developers were partly responsible for some of the scams on its site because of the &quot;thousands of free keys&quot; they had created for giveaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign's organiser, however, has dismissed this defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They are harming our industry and the value of our games,&quot; Mike Rose, from the Manchester-based publisher No More Robots, told BBC News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other industry insiders have also tweeted concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Chinese sales&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attraction for consumers of buying from key resellers is they typically offer titles at a fraction of the price they are available via either the games studio's own sites or through online stores such as Steam, with which the publishers have a direct relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studios have complained for some time about the trade. But tensions rose after G2A increased its social media activity and online ads to promote special deals tied to its fifth anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;G2A does not buy and sell second-hand codes itself. Rather, it compares itself to other online marketplaces such as eBay, which provide a place for third-parties to sell goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mr Rose claimed it did not do enough to combat dishonestly obtained keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sellers received an order, for example, they bought a code via Steam's Chinese store, where the keys were often sold at a quarter of their normal price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bypass Steam's own ban on such keys being passed to gamers in other markets, purchasers were told they must add another account to their friends list to receive the details, Mr Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new &quot;friend&quot; was in fact a bot, he said, which generated a link to a separate site where the Chinese code could be transferred without the exchange being detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the result was the publisher received a fraction of their normal cut, while the fee they had wanted to charge became seen as too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other cases, Mr Rose said, dealers cancelled the credit card transaction with which they had bought a key, after selling it on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Steam chased this up and voided the sale, gamers may have tried the title out and moved on, never noticing they had lost access as a consequence, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as a result, the publisher was not paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm seeing my sales happening - and then at the end of the month 30% of them are disappearing,&quot; Mr Rose said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would rather people pirate the game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Face the consequences'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, G2A said most keys on its market were sold by wholesalers who had bought large quantities directly from publishers at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said only 1% of the transactions on its site were problematic in any way and it was easy for users to report suspect parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If any key was illegally obtained, we'll remove it, block the seller and provide their personal data to the proper authorities,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    G2A says it gives developers a percentage cut of all sales of their games sold by third parties on its site
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said, a combination of the rating systems it provided and the anti-money laundering processes it employed acted as a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If someone wants to do something illegal, they know they will have to face the consequences,&quot; it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site said it would also start offering developers refunds worth 10 times the sum lost if they could prove keys had been sold on G2A after being bought with stolen credit card details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offer is limited to cases in which the initial purchases were made on the developers' own stores and had resulted in the payment provider having to be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're not doing this because we're the ones to blame but because we want to finally stop the accusations we've been getting,&quot; G2A said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it suggested studios providing keys to &quot;fake influencers&quot; was a bigger problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If the developer doesn't check them thoroughly, the keys sometimes end up in scammers' hands,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's why all the developers who participate in G2A Direct have access to our database and can check on their own whether a review key ended up on G2A or not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Fuelling demand&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Rose responded saying most developers relied on sales via Steam and other third-party stores rather than their own sites, so G2A's refund offer was a &quot;red herring&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he said the problem of fake influencers existed only because they had places to sell on the codes they had obtained in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Literally in the time I've been talking to you, two of them have appeared in my inbox,&quot; he told BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So much time in our job is taken up trying to deal with these people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
