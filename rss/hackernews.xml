<title>The App Store is a monopoly: Here&amp;#039;s why the EU is correct to investigate Apple</title>
<link>https://protonmail.com/blog/apple-app-store-antitrust/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://protonmail.com/blog/apple-app-store-antitrust/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the European Commission announced, in response to a complaint filed by Spotify, that it would be opening an investigation into Apple’s App Store practices, which potentially constitutes an illegal breach of EU competition laws. At Proton, we applaud this decision, and also Spotify’s bravery in bringing this complaint in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following years of advertising itself as a company that puts users first, Apple has increasingly aligned itself with oppressive governments and curtailed digital freedom. There was a time when Apple portrayed itself as a rebellious alternative to giants like Microsoft. Today, Apple has become a monopoly, crushing potential competitors with exploitative fees and conducting censorship on behalf of dictators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Latest: &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/tech-ceos-hearing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Four misleading claims Big Tech CEOs told Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American tech giants have long engaged in abusive behavior which is designed to stifle dissent and competition, and perpetuate their market dominance. &lt;strong&gt;We know this because we have quietly tolerated this exploitation for years.&lt;/strong&gt; And like many others, we have long hesitated to speak out for fear that these tech giants may abuse their market dominance to destroy all who dare to stand up against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we believe we can no longer in good conscience stay silent, and the recent and ongoing antitrust investigations against Apple in the United States and Europe help to validate our position. We have come to believe Apple has created a dangerous new normal allowing it to abuse its monopoly power through punitive fees and censorship that stifles technological progress, creative freedom, and human rights. Even worse, it has created a precedent that encourages other tech monopolies to engage in the same abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple is using its monopoly to hold all of us hostage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s iOS controls 25% of the global smartphone market (the other 75%, is largely controlled by Google’s Android). This means that for over a billion people (particularly in the US where their market share approaches 50%), the only way to install apps is through the App Store. This gives Apple enormous influence over the way software is created and consumed around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most harmful expression of this power is Apple’s exorbitant 30% tax on developers, which is now the subject of antitrust investigations in both the United States and the European Union. To be clear, this is an enormous fee and would be intolerable in normal market conditions, but it’s particularly damaging if you offer a product that competes with Apple. &lt;strong&gt;It is hard to stay competitive if you are forced to pay your competitor 30% of all of your earnings. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple attempts to justify these fees by arguing that the App Store is no different from a mall, where companies seeking to offer their products must pay rent to the owner of the mall (in this case, Apple). This argument conveniently ignores the fact that there is just a single mall when it comes to iOS and no possibility of a competing mall to rent space from. It is not illegal for Apple to own a mall and rent space, nor is it illegal for Apple to own the only mall. What is illegal, is exploiting the fact that it owns the only mall to charge excessively high pricing which harms competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is virtually indistinguishable from a protection racket: It is a fee that developers must pay if they want to stay in business. And it is a fee which ultimately harms consumers because these fees are indirectly passed on to users, either through higher prices, or through fewer competing products in the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the European Commission launched its investigation on June 16, Apple released a statement saying “the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comment reveals the callousness with which Apple has hijacked and strangled the creativity that once flourished on the Internet. If only a handful of the most powerful companies have complained (such as Spotify), it is because Apple’s market dominance leaves small developers powerless to object: Either fall in line or be removed from the App Store, with no possibility to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has now even gone so far as to ban apps from the App Store if they refuse to offer in-app purchases for paid features that are available for purchase elsewhere. In other words, Apple wants a nearly one-third cut of your sales, regardless of whether you want to sell on their platform or not. This was precisely what happened with Proton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know from any mafia trial, the absence of witnesses willing to take the stand does not imply there was no crime, it only serves to highlight the power of the accused. By taking the stand today, we want to clearly refute Apple’s claim that only a “handful of companies” are objecting to these practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple helps propagate authoritarian laws globally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is improper (and illegal) to leverage market dominance for anti-competitive purposes, leveraging this power to suppress digital freedom is simply unethical, and it is long overdue that somebody called out Apple for this behavior. As first-hand witnesses to this behavior, we can share our story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2020, ProtonVPN submitted an update of its iOS app description in the App Store. The new description highlighted ProtonVPN’s features, including the ability to “unblock censored websites” with the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though ProtonVPN had been in the App Store since 2018 and the basic functionality of our VPN has not changed, Apple abruptly rejected the new app version and threatened to remove ProtonVPN entirely. They demanded that we remove this language around anti-censorship on the grounds that freedom of speech is severely limited in some countries. The options are comply or be removed from the App Store. What is most troubling is that Apple requested the removal of the language around censorship in ALL countries where our app is available, in effect &lt;strong&gt;doing the bidding of authoritarian governments even in countries where freedom of speech is protected&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that in countries around the world, such as China, South Sudan, and Saudi Arabia, freedom of speech is indeed severely limited, and thousands of activists have been killed or imprisoned for expressing themselves. &lt;strong&gt;However, by conceding to tyrants and enforcing the lowest common denominator, Apple is ignoring internationally recognized human rights and forfeiting progress we all enjoy and which activists have paid for with their lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest threats to democracy and freedom in the 21st century is Internet censorship, and in this regard VPNs are one of the best tools available to empower people with access to independent sources of accurate information. The free flow of ideas — along with the right to keep your ideas private — is one of the first principles of democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related: &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/big-tech-congress/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Why antitrust is really about privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is apparently a principle that Apple no longer believes in. For example, Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3048047/apple-removed-805-apps-china-2018-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;willingly complies&lt;/a&gt; with Chinese laws that restrict users’ access to thousands of apps and that require foreign companies to store the data of its citizens within the country and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17587304/apple-icloud-china-user-data-state-run-telecom-privacy-security&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;make them available&lt;/a&gt; to authorities. Even &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8582233.stm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has gone further to resist such Chinese pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we find unacceptable, however, is that Apple is using its market dominance to also force other companies which might otherwise be willing to make a stand to also be complicit in human rights abuses. This extends beyond limiting our ability to fight against censorship with our app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, Apple has censored news platforms such as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Bloomberg News, while in Hong Kong it &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/protesters-free-speech/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;blocked the access to the HKMaps app&lt;/a&gt; that supported the local democracy protests. It has also agreed to delete dozens of apps, including podcasts, that China says violate local censorship laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of Proton’s mission to make privacy and digital freedom universally accessible, we developed ProtonVPN, the world’s first free and unlimited VPN service that does not track or log users’ activity. We are on the front lines of the global fight for freedom and recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com/blog/hong-kong-security-law/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;ranked third in the Hong Kong App Store&lt;/a&gt; during the Hong Kong freedom protests. By censoring ProtonVPN’s app description in order to comply with authoritarian government requests, Apple is making it incrementally more difficult for people to exercise their fundamental human rights and sending a clear signal that profits come before people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With great power (and profits) comes great responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its own portrayal as a paragon of human rights, the instances where Apple has proven itself as a defender of these rights have become rarer in recent years. The level of compromise it is willing to make on freedom of speech has startled even its own investors — the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/155a3a80-58d2-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;shareholders demanding&lt;/a&gt; the company uphold basic human rights has been increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Apple reported record profits of $55 billion, making it the world’s most profitable tech company. We do not object to Apple making money, and they are entitled to try to make as much money as possible. However, like any company, Apple must also follow the law, including competition laws, and on this point, we strongly support and endorse the EU’s move to hold Apple accountable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also believe that tech companies, particularly those with $55 billion in profits, have a minimum moral responsibility to uphold human rights, even if it is not legally enforceable. It is however, enforceable by us, as consumers. By choosing who we give money to, we signal what we consider to be an acceptable minimum moral responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that by taking a stand today, we can also embolden others to speak out and work towards creating a more equitable, free, and just society. Are you also a victim of Apple’s abusive practices? Let us know at legal@protonmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tampa teen accused of being ‘mastermind’ behind Twitter hack</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) – A Tampa teenager is in jail, accused of being the “mastermind” behind a &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/national/bill-gates-elon-musk-twitter-accounts-hacked-in-apparent-cryptocurrency-scam/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hack on the social media website Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that caused limited access to the site and high-profile accounts, according to jail records and the Hillsborough State Attorney’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2020/07/graham-ivan-clark-mug.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-563860&quot; width=&quot;192&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2020/07/graham-ivan-clark-mug.jpg 384w, https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2020/07/graham-ivan-clark-mug.jpg?resize=240,300 240w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px&quot;/&gt;Graham Clark (Hillsborough County Jail photo)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 On Your Side’s Ryan Hughes received exclusive information about the arrest of 17-year-old Graham Clark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren filed 30 felony charges against the teen this week for “scamming people across America” in connection with the Twitter hack that &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/viral-news/twitter-disables-tweets-from-verified-accounts-after-hack-wfla-unable-to-tweet/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;happened on July 15&lt;/a&gt;. The charges he’s facing include one count of organized fraud, 17 counts of communications fraud, one count of fraudulent use of personal information with over $100,000 or 30 or more victims, 10 counts of fraudulent use of personal information and one count of access to computer or electronic device without authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hillsborough County Jail records show Clark was booked into jail shortly after 6:30 a.m. Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warren’s office says the scheme to defraud &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/national/twitter-says-attackers-successfully-targeted-some-of-our-employees-to-gain-internal-tools/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;“stole the identities of prominent people”&lt;/a&gt; and “posted messages in their names directing victims to send Bitcoin” to accounts that were associated with the Tampa teen. According to the state attorney, the scheme reaped more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/local-news/bitcoin-boon-or-bust-can-you-still-make-money-on-cryptocurrencies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;$100,000 in Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; in just one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is difficult to track and recover if stolen in a scam,” the state attorney’s office says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;promo-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/national/president-trump-to-order-chinese-company-to-sell-tiktoks-u-s-operations-report-says/&quot; class=&quot;promo-link__link&quot;&gt;President Trump to order Chinese company to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations, report says&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/entertainment-news/barack-obama-to-appear-on-michelle-obamas-podcast-debut/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Former President Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/battleground-florida-who-will-joe-biden-choose-as-his-running-mate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;presidential candidate Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/washington-dc/florida-lawmakers-grill-google-apple-amazon-facebook-on-their-power-over-americans/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/elon-musk-being-courted-to-move-tesla-headquarters-to-florida/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; were just some of the names who were impacted by the hack. Twitter officials recently said that it had limited access to its internal tools after the high-profile hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These crimes were perpetrated using the names of famous people and celebrities, but they’re not the primary victims here. This ‘Bit-Con’ was designed to steal money from regular Americans from all over the country, including here in Florida,” Warren said in a statement. “This massive fraud was orchestrated right here in our backyard, and we will not stand for that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the state attorney’s office, the FBI and U.S. Department of Justice found the suspect behind the attack in Hillsborough County after a “complex, nationwide investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of California, Clark is one of three people charged for their alleged roles in the Twitter hack. The two other suspects were identified as 22-year-old Nima Fazeli, a.k.a. “Rolex,” of Orlando and 19-year-old Mason Sheppard, a.k.a. “Chaewon,” of the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to congratulate our federal law enforcement partners – the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, the FBI, the IRS, and the Secret Service – as well as the Florida Department of Law enforcement. They worked quickly to investigate and identify the perpetrator of a sophisticated and extensive fraud,” State Attorney Warren said in his statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;promo-link&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/tampa-teen-accused-of-being-mastermind-behind-twitter-hack-that-targeted-high-profile-accounts/&quot; class=&quot;promo-link__link&quot;&gt;Lawmakers grill major tech CEOs about their business models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren added that Clark will be prosecuted in Hillsborough County because “this defendant lives here in Tampa” and “he committed the crime here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter released a statement shortly after the arrest thanking law enforcement for their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We appreciate the swift actions of law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case progresses,” the company said. “For our part, we are focused on being transparent and providing updates regularly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the hack, White House officials were concerned about President Donald Trump’s Twitter account, which he uses daily to push out news and other information. They assured the public that his account has extra protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida’s Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis also voiced his concern that &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-cfo-fears-twitter-breach-could-target-economy-elections/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar hacks could target Florida’s economy and elections&lt;/a&gt;. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement was called on to help investigate the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patronis released a scathing statement Friday after the arrests were announced saying “Twitter needs to step up their game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“News that the alleged mastermind behind the recent unprecedented Twitter hacks was arrested right in Florida’s backyard is alarming. The fact that a teenager could gain such access to Twitter is mind-boggling and goes to prove that the tech-giant needs to step up its game,” Patronis said. “This is exactly why I called on FDLE to conduct an investigation and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfloridacfo.com/sitePages/newsroom/pressRelease.aspx?id=5590&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Twitter to provide vital information&lt;/a&gt; to help protect our citizens. Twitter is an extremely powerful tool that governments, industries, members of the media and billions of other people rely on for communicating important information.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Spotify CEO: musicians can no longer release music only “once every 3-4 years”</title>
<link>https://www.thefader.com/2020/07/30/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-says-working-musicians-can-no-longer-release-music-only-once-every-three-to-four-years</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph_wrapper center_align&quot; readability=&quot;44.844801607233&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify CEO Daniel Ek discussed streaming and sustainability in a recent interview with &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://musically.com/2020/07/30/spotify-ceo-talks-covid-19-artist-incomes-and-podcasting-interview/&quot;&gt;Music Ally&lt;/a&gt; published on Thursday. Ek denied criticisms that Spotify pays insufficient royalties to artists, and insisted that the role of the musician had changed in today's &quot;future landscape.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad paragraph_wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ek claimed that a &quot;narrative fallacy&quot; had been created and caused music fans to believe that Spotify doesn't pay musicians enough for streams of their music. &quot;Some artists that used to do well in the past may not do well in this future landscape,&quot; Ek said, &quot;where you can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is required from successful musicians, Ek insisted, is a deeper, more consistent, and prolonged commitment than in the past. “The artists today that are making it realize that it’s about creating a continuous engagement with their fans. It is about putting the work in, about the storytelling around the album, and about keeping a continuous dialogue with your fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad paragraph_wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify's stock value hit &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviergarret/2020/07/02/the-next-netflix-has-finally-revealed-itself/#38836e7832db&quot;&gt;all-time highs of $50 billion&lt;/a&gt; this summer even as questions about the streaming platform's compensation of artists remain unresolved. Royalties on Spotify and Apple Music are determined on a &quot;pro-rata&quot; basis; payment on each particular song is based on how much the song is streamed in comparison with the platform's most popular tracks. This results in &quot;the tiniest of payouts for most independent musicians,&quot; as Liz Pelly wrote for &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; href=&quot;https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Baffler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Ek alleged that artists have said &quot;many times&quot; in private that they are happy with their royalties from Spotify, and said that he believes that musicians who cannot make a living may not be in step with modern standards. “I feel, really, that the ones that aren’t doing well in streaming are predominantly people who want to release music the way it used to be released,” Ek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FADER has reached out to Spotify for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A College Degree Is No Guarantee of a Good Life</title>

<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8iajp0n7MqeUbxVS7lFMR0q1KvM=/media/img/posts/2020/06/smiley/original.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/category/how-build-life/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;How to Build a Life&lt;/a&gt;” is a biweekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;magine a&lt;/span&gt; young man, a senior in high school. His academic performance has never been over the top, but he’s done well enough. Among his classmates, the assumption is that all of them will go to college. However, just as his parents are about to send the deposit check to a college where he has been accepted, the young man admits to himself and his parents that he doesn’t want to go—not now, maybe never. To him, college sounds like drudgery. He wants to work, to earn a living, to be out on his own.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What should he do? What should his parents do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a hypothetical situation for many families—and it wasn’t for mine, either. Our oldest son was valedictorian of his high school class and went to a top university. But right about this time two years ago, our second son told us he wasn’t interested in college. My wife and I consider ourselves free thinkers and are willing to entertain almost any new idea. But we are hardly neutral on the college question: I am a college professor; my father was a college professor; &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; father was a college professor, too. Some say college is different from real life. For our family, college &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; real life—it’s the family business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children have to build their own lives; we all know this. But parents want the best for them and don’t want them to commit errors that will make it harder to build those lives. How should children and their parents think about this conundrum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;College is&lt;/span&gt; often discussed as an investment in the future: You pay up front so you can benefit abundantly for the rest of your life. The financial benefits of a college education do indeed look great, on average. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/jobs/2012/10/05/regardless-of-the-cost-college-still-matters/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney at the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project, as of 2011 a college degree delivered an inflation-adjusted annual return of more than 15 percent per year. That’s a good deal. “The return to college is more than double the average return over the last 60 years experienced in the stock market,” they noted, “and more than five times the return to investments in corporate bonds ... gold ... long-term government bonds ... or housing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as investors like to say, past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Many analysts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/07/16/stagnant-wage-growth-new-college-graduates&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; wage growth stagnating for college graduates, with average starting salaries increasing just 1.4 percent from 2015 to 2018—a period when the economy was roaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/04/mitch-daniels-purdue/606772/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;From the April 2020 issue: The college president who simply won’t raise tuition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you figure in the costs, the plot thickens even more. From 1989 to 2016, college tuition and fees &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#448bfa6c66c1&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;went up&lt;/a&gt; by 98 percent (in inflation-adjusted terms), which is roughly 11 times more than the growth in real median household &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;income&lt;/a&gt;. This has led to a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of student-loan debt. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2017-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2016-education-debt-loans.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to the Federal Reserve, the average person with student loans in 2017 owed $32,731.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be worth the cost for kids who want to go into a field that requires a college degree. Some kids think they know what they want to do after college, but others don’t, so for them college is like buying an expensive insurance policy. Still, it’s worth noting that in 2019, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_underemployment_rates.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;66 percent&lt;/a&gt; of college graduates were in jobs requiring a college degree. What’s more, as of 2010, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;27 percent&lt;/a&gt; were in jobs related to their college major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, enrolling in college doesn’t always translate to a degree. While nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.credit.com/personal-finance/average-student-loan-debt/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;67 percent&lt;/a&gt; of high school graduates were enrolled in college in 2017, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/cb17-51.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;33.4 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans held a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2016. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nscresearchcenter.org/some-college-no-degree-2019/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to the National Student Clearinghouse database, 36 million Americans have received some postsecondary education but haven’t completed college and are no longer enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/09/why-is-college-so-expensive-in-america/569884/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Why is college in America so expensive?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, dropping out is not randomly distributed. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/why-do-so-many-americans-drop-out-of-college/255226/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, it is the least economically advantaged students, and those who don’t want to go to college in the first place (such as our son), who are among those most likely to leave midstream. As he reminded us, an unfinished degree costs time and money and is of little use in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Perhaps you aren’t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;homo economicus&lt;/em&gt;, and don’t primarily use cost-benefit analysis to make decisions about your life or your child’s. But everyone wants to be happy, and wants their child to be happy as well. So let’s look at the happiness effects of college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who go to college are slightly likelier to report that they are happy about their lives than those who don’t go to college. In 2011, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that 89 percent of high-school graduates who did not attend college said they were happy or very happy, compared with 94 percent of bachelor’s-degree holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;correlation&lt;/em&gt;, of course, and it is not at all clear in the scholarly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2015.1111982&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt; that education &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; greater happiness. Some scholars have found that, when controlling for other factors in life such as income and religious faith, education by itself has no independent explanatory power over happiness. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0047272795015647&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; actually believe that education is negatively linked to happiness, and hypothesize that some college attendees trade ambition for life satisfaction. The bottom line is that the case is not closed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/colleges-are-weighing-costs-reopening-fall/610759/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;Graeme Wood: There’s no simple way to reopen universities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s all that student debt to consider. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/174317/student-debt-linked-worse-health-less-wealth.aspx&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'None'&quot;&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to a Gallup study from 2014, student debt is negatively correlated with financial and physical health and sense of purpose, and is associated with lower well-being on these dimensions for as long as 25 years after graduation. Again: That’s correlation, not causation. But it is easy to imagine how $393 per month (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/student-loans/heres-average-student-loan-payment-how-lower-yours/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'None'&quot;&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; student-loan payment) could dampen one’s spirits even in service of a career you love, let alone one you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;he evidence&lt;/span&gt; on the economic and happiness benefits of college is mixed. The only thing we can say with assurance is, “It depends.” On what? On the unique attributes of each person. Just as no one actually has 2.5 kids, averages don’t help much in figuring out the particulars of one person’s life. A child’s gifts, circumstances, and career ambitions all affect whether college is the right choice. Most of all, it depends on what they want to do. As a longtime academic, I can assure you that the No. 1 predictor of a failure to thrive in college is not wanting to be there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may be obvious to would-be students, but to many of their parents it isn’t. The college decision is often as much about the parents as it is about their kids. Tisha Duncan, a professor and college adviser, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/09/how-college-changes-parent-child-relationship/598630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'20',r'None'&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Alia Wong for a piece in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, “Instead of students announcing, ‘I got into college!,’ the parents are announcing, ‘We got into college!’” It’s easy to project our own desires onto our kids—to try to see our own potential come alive through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/11/some-colleges-could-soon-cost-100000-year/601648/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'21',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Six-figure price tags are coming to colleges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a mistake. No one can build a life alone—we all need help—but in the end, our lives are our own&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I remember making this case to my own parents at 19, when I told them I was going to drop out of college to go on tour as a classical musician. My wife, who grew up in poverty, made the same case to her parents when she dropped out of school to sing in a rock band. In both our cases, we completed our education later in life, but there was no guarantee at the time that we ever would. These were decisions that were staunchly opposed by our parents. Our son, wily devil that he is, reminded us of all this when he told us he didn’t want to go to college. He had us dead to rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we blessed his decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;he summer&lt;/span&gt; after our son graduated from high school, many people who knew us sensitively avoided asking us about our son’s future plans—assuming that we must be none too pleased that he wasn’t going to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have plans: He found a job across the country on a wheat farm in central Idaho. This wasn’t a hobby or a whim. He became part of a community of honest, hardworking people. He worked from dawn until well past dark through his first harvest, driving a combine, fixing fences, and picking rocks out of the soil. In the winter he found a job apprenticing to an expert cabinetmaker, and started his own small business hauling firewood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, word about our son started getting around among people we knew who had children his age. Some of their sons and daughters were starting to struggle in college with grades, drinking, and loneliness. At gatherings, other fathers would sometimes sidle up to me and ask, “Just out of curiosity, how did your boy find that job out in Idaho?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/whats-college-good-for/546590/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'22',r'None'&quot;&gt;From the January/February 2018 issue: The world might be better off without college for everyone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his second harvest, with money in the bank, our son joined the Marine Corps, a dream he had had for several years. He finished boot camp and is now at infantry school in North Carolina. He wakes up at 4 a.m., is tired all the time—and is happy. He is, as a translation of the second-century Saint Irenaeus puts it, “a man fully alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a believer in the power of higher education to change lives and create opportunity, and am proud to teach at one of the greatest universities in the world. College is absolutely the right choice for many. But my son reminded me of a fundamental truth, which is that each of our lives is a start-up enterprise, and there is not just one path to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college-for-all fever that has overtaken so much of our culture is a crass and classist mistake, because it ignores the gifts that people like my son have to develop and share. Maybe my son will still decide he wants to go to college someday. Maybe he won’t. But he is building his life with integrity and grit. And, frankly, that’s all a father could ever ask.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of observability has caught fire in the last few years, both in DevOps and monitoring circles. You may already be familiar with observability operations, which include logging, tracing, and displaying metrics. But how do you do those three things well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of current and relevant online resources to help guide you on logging, tracing, and metrics. Go back to your team armed with these resources and you're sure to spark some ideas on how to handle your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://content.microfocus.com/itops-monitoring-tb/centralize-it-ops?lx=O4Iukj&amp;amp;utm_source=techbeacon&amp;amp;utm_medium=techbeacon&amp;amp;utm_campaign=00134846&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monitoring challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Intro to logging, tracing, and metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://winderresearch.com/logging-vs-tracing-vs-monitoring/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Logging vs Tracing vs Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a quick introduction to the three pillars of white-box monitoring/observability, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drphilwinder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Phil Winder&lt;/a&gt;'s post is just the thing. He describes each pillar while also providing his own opinions on their advantages and disadvantages. The instrumentation and monitoring pillar is also called &quot;metrics&quot; by some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-in-the-time-of-cloud-native-c87c7a5bfa3e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Monitoring in the time of Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most comprehensive look at the modern state of observability and monitoring, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/copyconstruct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cindy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/copyconstruct&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sridharan&lt;/a&gt;'s content is required reading. The article introduces the concept of observability, defines the three pillars of modern observability—logging, request tracing, and metrics collection—and describes when you might consider using each pillar. &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/logs-and-metrics-6d34d3026e38&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Logs and Metrics&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is another good post by Sridharan on just those two pillars. It's shorter, but it gives more concise information, not all of which is in the other article. She has also written a free e-book on this topic called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://distributed-systems-observability-ebook.humio.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Distributed Systems Observability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black-box vs. white-box monitoring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.influxdata.com/metrics-are-dead/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Metrics are Dead?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attending the Monitorama conference, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pauldix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Paul Dix&lt;/a&gt; shared some useful opinions and advice on the relevance of metrics (what he calls &quot;regular time series&quot;) in modern monitoring. This article shares some helpful angles for looking at each of the three monitoring pillars. It concludes that while tracing is more useful for microservices, in more common monolithic architectures, metrics, events, and logs are king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/you-should-have-better-logging-now-fbab2f667fac&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;An introduction to logging for programmers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeCodeCamp is a great publication to learn from if you're a beginner developer. Anyone dealing with operations and debugging should know how logging works, and this article is a wonderful start for anyone who hasn't learned how to do it. The author, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefvardalos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stefanos Vardalos&lt;/a&gt;, defines diagnostic and audit logging while also sharing some example logging tools for back-end and front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This resource isn't just one article, but an entire site. It was created by Loggly, a log management vendor, but the content is vendor-neutral and community-maintained. There are nine sections: .NET, Apache, Java, Linux, Node.js, PHP, Python, Systemd, and Windows. Each section has a guide to the basics and discussions on how to analyze or parse logs, how to troubleshoot common issues, and how to centralize or aggregate logs in a distributed system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Matthew Skelton&lt;/a&gt; shares excellent insights on modern logging in this talk. The key, he says, is using the right transaction identifiers so that calls can be traced across components, services, and queues. He also has another good article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/articles/why-test-logging&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;why and how you should test logging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Honeycomb.io blog is an excellent place to find log management content. Many of its posts focus on promoting structured logging, and although Honeycomb.io is a product vendor, many posts are product-agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Charity Majors&lt;/a&gt;, a co-founder of Honeycomb.io, wrote the &quot;Lies My Parents Told Me&quot; post, which explores 11 assumptions about logs and why they're bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For application-level logging, you'll want to look at the documentation of the language and framework you're using to see which built-in logging capabilities they have before you start looking for external libraries. Some languages are easier to work with in terms of logging than others; I've heard developers call Java logging &quot;a mess&quot; on more than one occasion. So I shared a Python-based logging introduction for this article, since Python is widely regarded as an excellent learner's language. In this tutorial, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mariocj89&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mario Corchero&lt;/a&gt; dissects the Python logging module and shows you how to use, configure, and extend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tiwarivikash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vikesh Tiwari&lt;/a&gt; wrote an interesting architectural outline of the open-source software you could use to build a centralized logging application. He goes into detail on log collection, transport, storage, analysis, and alerting capabilities that you'd need to consider. (He never did write part two of this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; had transitioned from a monolithic architecture to microservices, but the monitoring and logging systems couldn't keep up. In this post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonaskathryn/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kathryn Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, the lead engineer at the newspaper, shares the story of how her team ran a hackathon to build standardized structured logging across all service teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logging in the context of security operations is a topic that could fill a whole other article. When building your logging architecture, make sure to include security experts or advocates in the organization. Logging is critical to detecting attacks and intrusions. A good place to start learning about logging as it relates to security is with this OWASP logging cheat sheet, along with its other security operations resources.&lt;/p&gt;

The setup uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; as a search engine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elastic/kibana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kibana&lt;/a&gt; as a graphical interface, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fluentd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fluentd&lt;/a&gt; to transmit the logs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tracing&lt;/a&gt; is another major component of monitoring, and it's becoming even more useful in microservice architectures. A few of the previous resources in the logging section covered tracing and often suggested using correlation IDs for tracing transactions through different parts of your microservices architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that strategy, you'll want the operations side to have some decent knowledge about tracing at the OS level. This article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pratyushanand80&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pratyush Anand&lt;/a&gt; on dynamic Linux tracing provides an introduction for the average user, starting with some definitions and finishing with simple examples of how to set a few probe points.&lt;/p&gt;

For an awesome introduction on how to use a Linux tracer, watch Gregg's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-12-27/linux-tracing-in-15-minutes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;15-minute demo on Linux tracing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/b0rk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt; is another great source of information for Linux tracing and other operations topics. This resource might be even better for beginners, since it takes the perspective of an in-process learner of Linux tracing systems. Her article gives quick overviews for several tools, provides cool drawings for clearer understanding, and generally makes the ecosystem of Linux tracing systems more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your organization uses Windows Server, you'll need a different set of tracing tutorials. This page from Microsoft's hardware dev center should have you covered, with links to 12 sections about the technical details of Windows tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rapid7.com/2014/09/22/how-to-trace-transactions-across-every-layer-of-your-distributed-software-stack/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How to Trace Transactions Across Every Layer of Your Distributed Software Stack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This product-agnostic article outlines the features in modern application performance management (APM) systems that allow you to trace transactions across a distributed system. It explains how to reconstruct a transaction, trace it across the network, and generally use log data to get a full view of your system. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xaprb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Baron Scwartz&lt;/a&gt; has a good post to read as a follow-up to this one: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vividcortex.com/blog/2015/10/15/end-to-end-traces/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;What If You Can't Trace End-to-End?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sematext.com/blog/opentracing-distributed-tracing-emerging-industry-standard/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenTracing: Distributed Tracing’s Emerging Industry Standard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the previous article, which promotes commercial APM tools, this post introduces the OpenTracing standard, a set of vendor-neutral APIs and instrumentation for distributed tracing. The author, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arch_rabbit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nedim Šabić&lt;/a&gt;, explains why this is beneficial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Traditionally, APM vendors had their own proprietary tracing agents and SDKs that would instrument applications, either automatically (blackbox instrumentation) or by having their users modify or annotate their apps’ source code (whitebox instrumentation). Long story short, this has issues such as vendor lock-in for users, and high costs associated with addition and maintenance of support for an ever-increasing number of technologies and their versions that need to be instrumented for vendors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Šabić wrote this article to introduce the technical details of OpenTracing, and also wrote three other articles to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sematext.com/blog/jaeger-vs-zipkin-opentracing-distributed-tracers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;introduce&lt;/a&gt; and compare &lt;a href=&quot;https://sematext.com/blog/opentracing-zipkin-as-distributed-tracer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zipkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sematext.com/blog/opentracing-jaeger-as-distributed-tracer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;—two open-source tools that implement the OpenTracing standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to front-end tracing, you'll have to use browser tools. Google has excellent documentation on how to trace performance issues in Chrome using its DevTools suite. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kaycebasques&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kayce Basques&lt;/a&gt; provides a visual walkthrough of the analysis process and shows you how to read the performance graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this is an older article, the middle section has some useful advice about logging vs. tracing. It explains how each needs to be treated differently in your system architecture and what their goals are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmellingwood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Justin Ellingwood&lt;/a&gt; defines metrics, monitoring, and alerting while also clarifying their goals. He also discusses the different types of metrics and the various factors that will affect what you choose to monitor. The article concludes with a short glossary of monitoring terminology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article takes a broader scope for looking at critical cloud application metrics, including topics such as security and capacity. Each metric comes with a definition, an explanation of why it's important, and a graphical illustration. The 10 metrics are availability, reliability (mean time between failures and mean time to repair), response time, throughput, security, capacity, scalability, latency, service/help desk, and cost per customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Christian Fraedrich of Capital One writes about his own team's favorite metrics: calls per minute, error rate, response time, and bandwidth saturation. After introducing these four measures, and his views on metrics in general, he continues with two other articles on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/the-mon-ifesto-part-2-alerting-and-graphing-bf51828a008f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;alerting and graphing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/the-mon-ifesto-part-3-alert-response-and-post-mortem-cd227c684ac0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;alert responses and post-mortems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gone are the days where engineers wake up in the middle of the night to respond to Nagios alerts on CPU or Memory. Collect everything, alert on four things, correlate everything. We can take this 'shortcut' because if there’s a problem — a real problem — on one of our app hosts, the symptoms will bubble up into one of our four key metrics.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/peter_fraedrich&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Peter Christian Fraedrich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gathering metrics always has a performance overhead associated with it. The developers of Wallaroo, an open-source data processing framework, share some of the challenges you run into when trying to reduce the overhead of gathering metrics. The post primarily focuses on the choices the Wallaroo team made when deciding what kinds of metrics to gather and how to display them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Displaying metrics in an easily digestible format is half the battle when it comes to observability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmtsn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John Matson&lt;/a&gt; has a great three-part series on graphing metrics that should put you in a position to make better decisions about how you want to visualize your monitoring metrics. The three posts cover &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/timeseries-metric-graphs-101/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;time series&lt;/a&gt; graphs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/summary-graphs-metric-graphs-101/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;summary graphs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/anti-patterns-metric-graphs-101/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;graphing anti-patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a deeper look into how a successful web company does monitoring, you can check out GitLab's internal monitoring documentation. Since GitLab follows a doctrine of radical transparency, nearly all of its internal knowledge base is online for all to see. This document gives you an idea of the tools it uses and the processes it has for monitoring, but it's not an article—you'll have to poke around to see if there are any useful ideas you can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prometheus is a popular set of open-source tools and standards for monitoring in the cloud-native space. One of the aspects that make it so popular is its exposition format for metrics, which Cindy Sridharan praises in her &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-in-the-time-of-cloud-native-c87c7a5bfa3e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Monitoring in the time of Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt;&quot; article. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mateobur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mateo Burillo's&lt;/a&gt; article &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sysdig.com/blog/prometheus-metrics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prometheus Metrics&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is a good introduction to the simple syntax of Prometheus metrics, illustrating why they've become so popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the technology leaders at the forefront of the cloud-native movement, Netflix is a great company to take advice from when it comes to observability. This post gives a holistic view of how Netflix addressed challenges relating to logs, tracing, and metrics. Specifically, team members describe how they scaled their log ingestion, built distributed request tracing, improved metric sharing and alerting, improved their monitoring of data persistence systems, and tailored metrics' UIs for different groups.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Australia to make Facebook, Google pay for news</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-regulator/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-for-news-in-world-first-idUSKCN24V3UP</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-regulator/australia-to-make-facebook-google-pay-for-news-in-world-first-idUSKCN24V3UP</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will force U.S. tech giants Facebook Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_FB.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/FB.O&quot;&gt;FB.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) and Alphabet Inc’s (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_GOOGL.O_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O&quot;&gt;GOOGL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Google to pay Australian media outlets for news content in a landmark move to protect independent journalism that will be watched around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia will become the first country to require Facebook and Google to pay for news content provided by media companies under a royalty-style system that will become law this year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s about a fair go for Australian news media businesses. It’s about ensuring that we have increased competition, increased consumer protection, and a sustainable media landscape,” Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing less than the future of the Australian media landscape is at stake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move comes as the tech giants fend off calls around the world for greater regulation, and a day after Google and Facebook took a battering for alleged abuse of market power from U.S. lawmakers in a congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following an inquiry into the state of the media market and the power of the U.S. platforms, the Australian government late last year told Facebook and Google to negotiate a voluntary deal with media companies to use their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those talks went nowhere and Canberra now says if an agreement cannot reached through arbitration within 45 days the Australian Communications and Media Authority would set legally binding terms on behalf of the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said the regulation ignores “billions of clicks” that it sends to Australian news publishers each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It sends a concerning message to businesses and investors that the Australian government will intervene instead of letting the market work,” Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia and New Zealand, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a business model fit for the digital age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“UNFAIR AND DAMAGING”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media companies including News Corp Australia, a unit of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_NWSA.O_2”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/companies/NWSA.O&quot;&gt;NWSA.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), lobbied hard for the government to force the U.S. companies to the negotiating table amid a long decline in advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While other countries are talking about the tech giants’ unfair and damaging behaviour, the Australian government ... (is) taking world-first action,” News Corp Australia Executive Chairman Michael Miller said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2019 study estimated about 3,000 journalism jobs have been lost in Australia in the past 10 years, as traditional media companies bled advertising revenue to Google and Facebook which paid nothing for news content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, according to Frydenberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other countries have tried and failed to force the hands of the tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers in Germany, France and Spain have pushed to pass national copyright laws that force Google pay licensing fees when it publishes snippets of their news articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Google stopped showing news snippets from European publishers on search results for its French users, while Germany’s biggest news publisher, Axel Springer, allowed the search engine to run snippets of its articles after traffic to its sites to plunged.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An update on our security incident</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last updated on July 30, 2020, at 5:45 PM PT with new sections below on “What we know now” and “What we’re doing to protect our service”. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 30, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our investigation continues, we’re sharing an update to answer some of the remaining questions based on what we’ve discovered to date. We will provide a more detailed technical report on what occurred at a later date given the ongoing law enforcement investigation and after we’ve completed work to further safeguard our service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack. A successful attack required the attackers to obtain access to both our internal network as well as  specific employee credentials that granted them access to our internal support tools. Not all of the employees that were initially targeted had permissions to use account management tools, but the attackers used their credentials to access our internal systems and gain information about our processes. This knowledge then enabled them to target additional employees who did have access to our account support tools. Using the credentials of employees with access to these tools, the attackers targeted 130 Twitter accounts, ultimately Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been concern following this incident around our tools and levels of employee access. To run our business, we have teams around the world that help with account support. Our teams use proprietary tools to help with a variety of support issues as well as to review content in line with &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rules&quot;&gt;The Twitter Rules&lt;/a&gt; and respond to reports. Access to these tools is strictly limited and is only granted for valid business reasons. We have zero tolerance for misuse of credentials or tools, actively monitor for misuse, regularly audit permissions, and take immediate action if anyone accesses account information without a valid business reason. While these tools, controls, and processes are constantly being updated and improved, we are taking a hard look at how we can make them even more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems. This was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service. We take that responsibility seriously and everyone at Twitter is committed to keeping your information safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve communicated directly with the impacted account owners and worked to restore access to any accounts who may have been temporarily locked out during our remediation efforts. Our investigation is ongoing, and we are working with the appropriate authorities to ensure that the people responsible for this attack are identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we’re doing to protect our service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the attack, we’ve significantly limited access to our internal tools and systems to ensure ongoing account security while we complete our investigation. As a result, some features (namely, accessing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data&quot;&gt;Your Twitter Data&lt;/a&gt; download feature) and processes have been impacted. We will be slower to respond to account support needs, reported Tweets, and applications to our developer platform. We’re sorry for any delays this causes, but we believe it’s a necessary precaution as we make durable changes to our processes and tooling as a result  of this incident. We will gradually resume our normal response times when we’re confident it’s safe to do so. Thank you for your patience as we work through this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re always investing in increased security protocols, techniques and mechanisms – it’s how we work to stay ahead of threats as they evolve. Going forward, we’re accelerating several of our pre-existing security workstreams and improvements to our tools. We are also improving our methods for detecting and preventing inappropriate access to our internal systems and prioritizing security work across many of our teams. We will continue to organize ongoing company-wide phishing exercises throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to share updates and precautionary steps we take so that others can learn from this, too. We recognize the trust you place in us, and are committing to earning it by continued open, honest and timely updates anytime an incident like this happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 18, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve been informing via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283518038445223936&quot; class=&quot;has-hover-card&quot;&gt;@TwitterSupport&lt;/a&gt; account, on Wednesday, July 15, 2020, we detected a security incident at Twitter and took immediate action. As we head into the weekend, we want to provide an overview of where we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we summarize the situation as of July 17 at 8:35p Pacific Time. The following information is what we know as of today and may change as our investigation and outside investigations continue. Additionally, as the investigation of this incident is unfolding, there are some details — particularly around remediation — that we are not providing right now to protect the security of the effort. We will provide more details, where possible in the future, so that the community and our peers may learn and benefit from what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, we believe attackers targeted certain Twitter employees through a social engineering scheme. What does this mean? In this context, social engineering is the intentional manipulation of people into performing certain actions and divulging confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attackers successfully manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter’s internal systems, including getting through our two-factor protections. As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets. We are continuing our forensic review of all of the accounts to confirm all actions that may have been taken. In addition, we believe they may have attempted to sell some of the usernames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/accessing-your-twitter-data&quot;&gt;Your Twitter Data&lt;/a&gt;” tool. This is a tool that is meant to provide an account owner with a summary of their Twitter account details and activity. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true. None of the eight were verified accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our actions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We became aware of the attackers’ action on Wednesday, and moved quickly to lock down and regain control of the compromised accounts. Our incident response team secured and revoked access to internal systems to prevent the attackers from further accessing our systems or the individual accounts. As mentioned above, we are deliberately limiting the detail we share on our remediation steps at this time to protect their effectiveness and will provide more technical details, where possible, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to our efforts behind the scenes, shortly after we became aware of the ongoing situation, we took preemptive measures to restrict functionality for many accounts on Twitter - this included things like preventing them from Tweeting or changing passwords. We did this to prevent the attackers from further spreading their scam as well as to prevent them from being able to take control of any additional accounts while we were investigating. We also locked accounts where a password had been recently changed out of an abundance of caution. Late on Wednesday, we were able to return Tweeting functionality to many accounts, and as of today, have restored most of the accounts that were locked pending password changes for their owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuing our investigation of this incident, working with law enforcement, and determining longer-term actions we should take to improve the security of our systems. We have multiple teams working around the clock focused on this and on keeping the people who use Twitter safe and informed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the attackers accessed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important question for people who use Twitter is likely — did the attackers see any of my private information? For the vast majority of people, we believe the answer is, no. For the 130 accounts that were targeted, here is what we know as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attackers were not able to view previous account passwords, as those are not stored in plain text or available through the tools used in the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attackers were able to view personal information including email addresses and phone numbers, which are displayed to some users of our internal support tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In cases where an account was taken over by the attacker, they may have been able to view additional information. Our forensic investigation of these activities is still ongoing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that for up to 36 of the 130 targeted accounts, the attackers accessed the DM inbox, including 1 elected official in the Netherlands. To date, we have no indication that any other former or current elected official had their DMs accessed. [Added on July 22, 2020]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are actively working on communicating directly with the account-holders that were impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our next steps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we head into the weekend and next week, we are focused on these core objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restoring access for all account owners who may still be locked out as a result of our remediation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing our investigation of the incident and our cooperation with law enforcement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further securing our systems to prevent future attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolling out additional company-wide training to guard against social engineering tactics to supplement the training employees receive during onboarding and ongoing phishing exercises throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, we also begin the long work of rebuilding trust with the people who use and depend on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re acutely aware of our responsibilities to the people who use our service and to society more generally. We’re embarrassed, we’re disappointed, and more than anything, we’re sorry. We know that we must work to regain your trust, and we will support all efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. We hope that our openness and transparency throughout this process, and the steps and work we will take to safeguard against other attacks in the future, will be the start of making this right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283518038445223936&quot; class=&quot;has-hover-card&quot;&gt;@TwitterSupport&lt;/a&gt; as our investigation continues. &lt;/p&gt;
