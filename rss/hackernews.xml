<description>&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;The idea of converting classic cars to EVs has been around a while, and a number of companies, including some &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD&quot; data-ga=&quot;[[&amp;quot;Embedded Url&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Internal link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://jalopnik.com/the-best-part-about-the-new-production-of-electric-jagu-1828566250&amp;quot;,{&amp;quot;metric25&amp;quot;:1}]]&quot; href=&quot;https://jalopnik.com/the-best-part-about-the-new-production-of-electric-jagu-1828566250&quot;&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD&quot; data-ga=&quot;[[&amp;quot;Embedded Url&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Internal link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://jalopnik.com/volkswagen-will-now-convert-classic-beetles-to-electric-1837900039&amp;quot;,{&amp;quot;metric25&amp;quot;:1}]]&quot; href=&quot;https://jalopnik.com/volkswagen-will-now-convert-classic-beetles-to-electric-1837900039&quot;&gt;automakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, have been retrofitting old, classic cars with all-new EV drivetrains. Individual tinkerers have been doing this as well, but it’s not as easy as you’d hope. Dealing with salvaged EV drivetrains is difficult, with complex control and cooling systems. Now it finally looks like there’s going to be an easier way, as &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD&quot; data-ga=&quot;[[&amp;quot;Embedded Url&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;External link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://swindonpowertrain.com/uk/news.aspx&amp;quot;,{&amp;quot;metric25&amp;quot;:1}]]&quot; href=&quot;https://swindonpowertrain.com/uk/news.aspx&quot;&gt;Swindon Powertrain is planning on introducing an all-in-one compact EV crate motor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;The exciting thing about the motor, which they call their High Power Density EV powertrain, is that it’s remarkably compact and powerful for its size. To give an idea of how small it is, it’s essentially the same drivetrain used in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD&quot; data-ga=&quot;[[&amp;quot;Embedded Url&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;External link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://www.carthrottle.com/post/this-classic-mini-packs-electric-power-and-underfloor-heating/&amp;quot;,{&amp;quot;metric25&amp;quot;:1}]]&quot; href=&quot;https://www.carthrottle.com/post/this-classic-mini-packs-electric-power-and-underfloor-heating/&quot;&gt;their EV-converted classic Mini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so if it fits under a Mini’s hood, it should fit almost anywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;More specifically, the drivetrain measures 23.6 inches wide, 17.3 inches deep, and only 11.02 inches tall. We’re talking about a box that’s two feet by a foot and a half by a foot here. That’s pretty damn tiny.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;It weighs only around 154 pounds and makes around 110 horsepower—a pretty decent number considering how compact this thing is, and that includes everything: motor, single-speed transmission, cooling system, and power inverter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;The drivetrain includes multiple mounting points and it’s designed to be flexible enough to be mounted by either axle of the car, front or rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;A drawing on Swindon’s website shows it mounted in the front of a van or a classic Mini, or at the rear of a Caterham Seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;I haven’t found details about what sorts of battery packs it’s designed to work with, but ideally, it’ll be able to be adapted to work with battery packs from Leafs or Bolts or Teslas or whatever you can find in your local junkyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;It’s expected to be available around June of 2020, and as of yet, no pricing has been announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;It’s a very exciting idea, the promise of a drop-in ICE replacement, helping to keep classic cars on the road. I’ll admit I like this idea as a way to get my old &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;sc-145m8ut-0 fFmTKR js_link sc-1out364-0 fwjlmD&quot; data-ga=&quot;[[&amp;quot;Embedded Url&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Internal link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;https://jalopnik.com/reliant-scimitar-and-friends-271804&amp;quot;,{&amp;quot;metric25&amp;quot;:1}]]&quot; href=&quot;https://jalopnik.com/reliant-scimitar-and-friends-271804&quot;&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; back on the road, and if I stuck one in my Beetle, I’d come close to almost doubling my horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;I suspect you could use two in one car for all-wheel drive and more power, though Swindon doesn’t show that example specifically. I wonder if you could rotate it sideways and have it driving a driveshaft to a differential, using one of the axle output shafts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sc-77igqf-0 hJpRRP&quot;&gt;This is potentially very good news for hobbyists and small manufacturers. A true, drop-in EV crate motor that just works has been desired for a while, so it’s nice to see this finally happening.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ML From Scratch, Part 1: Linear Regression</title>
<link>http://www.oranlooney.com/post/ml-from-scratch-part-1-linear-regression/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.oranlooney.com/post/ml-from-scratch-part-1-linear-regression/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.oranlooney.com/post/ml-from-scratch-part-1-linear-regression_files/lead.png&quot; class=&quot;article-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;article-title-bottom&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;toc&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To kick off this series, will start with something simple yet foundational: linear regression via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares&quot;&gt;ordinary least squares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not exciting, linear regression finds widespread use both as a standalone learning algorithm and as a building block in more advanced learning algorithms. The output layer of a deep neural network trained for regression with MSE loss, simple AR time series models, and the “local regression” part of LOWESS smoothing are all examples of linear regression being used as an ingredient in a more sophisticated model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear regression is also the “simple harmonic oscillator” of machine learning; that is to say, a pedagogical example that allows us to present deep theoretical ideas about machine learning in a context that is not too mathematically taxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the small matter of it being the most widely used supervised learning algorithm in the world; although how much weight that carries I suppose depends on where you are on the “applied” to “theoretical” spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since I can already feel your eyes glazing over from such an introductory topic, we can spice things up a little bit by doing something which isn’t often done in introductory machine learning - we can present the algorithm that [your favorite statistical software here] &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; uses to fit linear regression models: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition&quot;&gt;QR decomposition&lt;/a&gt;. It seems this is commonly glossed over because it involves more linear algebra than can be generally assumed, or perhaps because the exact solution we will derive doesn’t generalize well to other machine learning algorithms, not even closely related variants such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_net_regularization&quot;&gt;regularized regression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_regression&quot;&gt;robust regression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current paradigm in machine learning is to apply very powerful, very general optimization algorithms that work for a wide variety of models and scale reasonably well to vast amounts of data. This allows researchers to iterate rapidly on the structure of the model without needing to spend a lot of time coming up with a clever algorithm which solves their special case efficiently. It’s good software engineering; it avoids &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize&quot;&gt;premature optimization&lt;/a&gt; and promotes good &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns&quot;&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/a&gt;. Still, history has shown that for any given optimization problem, there probably is a specialized algorithm that leverages the specifics of the problem to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in performance. For example, John Platt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_minimal_optimization&quot;&gt;Sequential Minimal Optimization&lt;/a&gt; beat earlier, more general algorithms by such a wide margin that for a decade (1998-2009?) SVMs were one of the most promising approaches to machine learning. Today (2019), the machine learning industry is in a kind of “rapid prototyping” mode, leveraging the flexibility and composability of deep neural networks to experiment with endless numbers of novel models. However, as our understanding of which models work best for particular problems matures, the industry will likely tip back in favor of researching specialized algorithms. If we are interested in understanding machine learning from scratch we should be prepared to study specialized algorithms when and where they arise naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after all, what’s a little linear algebra between friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;statistical-motivation&quot; class=&quot;section level2&quot; readability=&quot;94.626725219573&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Statistical Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we will use statistical considerations to motivate the definition of a particular mathematical optimization problem. Once we have posed this problem, we will afterwards ignore the statistics altogether and focus on numerical methods for solving the optimization problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by deriving the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalEquation.html&quot;&gt;normal equation&lt;/a&gt; from a statistical model. Let’s say that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; is a random vector of length &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; is a scalar random variable. &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Y\)&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; independent, but have a joint probability distribution &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(F(x, y; \Theta, \sigma)\)&lt;/span&gt; parameterized by a non-random parameter vector &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\Theta\)&lt;/span&gt;, a non-negative scalar &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\sigma\)&lt;/span&gt;, and a random error term &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\)&lt;/span&gt;. The model is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ Y = X^T \Theta + \epsilon \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose we sample &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; independent observations from &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(F\)&lt;/span&gt;. We place these into a real-valued &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(n\times m\)&lt;/span&gt; matrix &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; and a real-valued vector &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Just to be absolutely clear, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{y}\)&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; random variables; they are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realization_(probability)&quot;&gt;given data used to fit the model&lt;/a&gt;. We can then ask, what is the likelihood of obtaining the data &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y})\)&lt;/span&gt; given a parameter vector &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\Theta\)&lt;/span&gt;? By rearranging our equation as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Y - X\cdot\Theta = \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\)&lt;/span&gt; and using the p.d.f. of the normal distribution, we can see that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \begin{align} L(\Theta;\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y}) &amp;amp; = P(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y};\Theta) \\ &amp;amp; = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\mathbf{X}_i,\mathbf{y}_i;\Theta) \\ &amp;amp; = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \text{exp}\Big(\frac{-(\mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{X}_i^T\Theta)^2}{2\sigma^2} \Big) \\ \end{align} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks pretty awful, but there are a couple easy things we can do to make it a look a lot simpler. First, that constant term out front doesn’t matter at all: let’s just call it &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(C\)&lt;/span&gt; or something. We can also take that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(e^{-2\sigma^2}\)&lt;/span&gt; outside the product as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(e^{-2N\sigma^2}\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we’ll also stuff into the constant &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(C\)&lt;/span&gt; because we’re only interested in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\Theta\)&lt;/span&gt; right now. Finally, we can take a log to get rid of the exponential and turn the product into a sum. All together, we get the log-likelihood expression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \begin{align} \ell(\Theta;\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y}) &amp;amp; = \log L(\Theta;\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y}) \\ &amp;amp; = C - \sum_{i=1}^N -(\mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{X}^T_i\Theta)^2 \\ &amp;amp; = C - \lVert\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\Theta\rVert^2 \\ \end{align} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, because log is a monotonically increasing function, maximizing &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\ell\)&lt;/span&gt; is the same as maximizing &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(L\)&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, the constant &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(C\)&lt;/span&gt; has no effect whatsoever on the location of the maximum. We can also remove the minus sign and consider the problem as a minimization problem instead. Therefore our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximumLikelihood.html&quot;&gt;maximum likelihood estimate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\Theta\)&lt;/span&gt; for a given data set &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((X, y)\)&lt;/span&gt; is simply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \hat{\Theta} \triangleq \underset{\Theta}{\text{argmin}} \, \lVert\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\Theta\rVert^2 \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If statistics isn’t really your thing, I have some good news for you: we’re quits with it. Everything in this final equation is now a real-valued vector or matrix: there’s not a random variable or probability distribution in sight. It’s all over except for the linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we did above was essentially a short sketch of the relevant parts of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem&quot;&gt;Gauss-Markov theorem&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, we’ve shown that the OLS solution to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\Theta\)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the Maximum Likelihood Estimate for the parameters of the particular statistical model we started with. This isn’t true in general, but it is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; true for linear regression with a normally distributed error term. The full Gauss-Markov theorem proves a bunch of other nice properties: for example, it turns out this estimator is unbiased and we can even say that it’s optimal in the sense that it is the &lt;em&gt;best possible&lt;/em&gt; linear unbiased estimator. But we won’t need these further theoretical results to implement a working model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing you should remember, it’s this: the fact that the p.d.f. of the Gaussian distribution has the quadratic term &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((x -\mu)^2\)&lt;/span&gt; in the exponent is the &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; why squared error is the “right” loss function for linear regression. If the error of our linear model had a different distribution, we’d have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model&quot;&gt;make a different choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our key takeaway is that if it’s true that our response variable is related to our predictor variables by a linear equation plus a certain amount of random Gaussian noise, then we can recover good, unbiased estimates of that linear equations coefficients from nothing more than a finite number of data points sampled from the underlying distribution, and the way to actually calculate those estimates is to solve the OLS problem for the data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ordinary Least Squares&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: for this next section, we’re going to be doing some light vector calculus. I suggest you reference &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf&quot;&gt;the matrix cookbook&lt;/a&gt; if any of the notation or concepts aren’t familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s call the right-hand side (the part we’re trying to minimize) &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(J\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ J(\Theta) = \lVert \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\Theta \rVert^2 \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the problem is to minimize &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(J\)&lt;/span&gt; with respect to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\Theta\)&lt;/span&gt;. As optimization problems go, this one is pretty well behaved: it’s continuous, quadratic, convex, everywhere continuously differentiable, and unconstrained. That’s a fancy way of saying that it’s shaped like a big, round bowl. A bowl has a unique lowest point and it can always be found simply by letting a marble roll down hill until it comes to rest exactly at the lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these nice properties (and a very useful set of theorems called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions&quot;&gt;KKT conditions&lt;/a&gt;) we know that these properties guarentee that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(J\)&lt;/span&gt; has a unique global minimum and that we can find the minimum - the bottom of the bowl - by finding the one place where the gradient is zero in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it may not be obvious at first how to take the gradient of the squared norm of a vector, but recall that it is the inner product of that vector with its dual:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \nabla_\Theta J = \nabla_\Theta \; (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\Theta)^T(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\Theta) \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding it out with FOIL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \nabla_\Theta J = \nabla_\Theta \; \mathbf{y}^T \mathbf{y} - (\mathbf{X}\Theta)^T \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}^T \mathbf{X}\Theta + \Theta^T (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}) \Theta \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{y}^T \mathbf{y}\)&lt;/span&gt; is constant with respect to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\Theta\)&lt;/span&gt; so the first term simply vanishes. It’s less obvious but also true that the next two terms are equal to each other - just remember that a J is a scalar, so those terms are each scalar, and the transpose of a scalar is itself. The final term is a quadratic form, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F16/linearQuadraticGradients.pdf&quot;&gt;general rule&lt;/a&gt; is $ x^T A x = A^T x + A x $ but because the product of a matrix with itself is always symmetric (&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X^T X = (X^T X)^T\)&lt;/span&gt;) we can use the simpler form &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\nabla x^T A x = 2 A x\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \nabla_\Theta J = - 2 \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y} + 2 \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} \Theta \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this equal to zero at the minimum, which we will call &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{\Theta}\)&lt;/span&gt;, and dividing both sides by two, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} \hat{\Theta} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y} \tag{1} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalEquation.html&quot;&gt;normal equation&lt;/a&gt;. The importance of this step is that we’ve reduced the original optimization problem to a system of linear equations which may be solved purely by the methods of linear algegra. To see this, note that we know &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;, so the right hand side is a known vector, the left-hand side is a matrix times an unknown vector, so this is just the familiar equation for solving for a particular solution to a system of equations &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Ax = b\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}\)&lt;/span&gt; is square and non-singular and therefore invertible, we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; just left-multiply both sides by its inverse to get an explicit closed form for &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{\Theta}\)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \hat{\Theta} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} X^T \mathbf{y} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it turns out there is a faster and more numerically stable way of solving for &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{\Theta}\)&lt;/span&gt; which relies on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition&quot;&gt;QR Decomposition&lt;/a&gt; of the matrix &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\mathbf{X}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;qr-decomposition&quot; class=&quot;section level2&quot; readability=&quot;59.442832269298&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QR Decomposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re going to be both &lt;em&gt;implementing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;relying on&lt;/em&gt; the QR decomposition in a minute, it’s worth making sure we understand how it works in detail. A QR decomposition of a matrix square &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; is a product of an orthogonal matrix &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt; and an upper-triangular matrix &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; such that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A = QR\)&lt;/span&gt;. It always exists and there’s a reasonably performant algorithm for calculating it. Why is it beneficial to put a matrix in this form? In short, because it makes it very easy to compute solutions to systems of equations in matrix form &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Ax = b\)&lt;/span&gt;; all we have to do is compute &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A = QR\)&lt;/span&gt; and write the problem as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R x = Q^{-1} b\)&lt;/span&gt; which is easy to compute. Let’s examine those two steps in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt; easy to invert? Recall that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt; is orthogonal which implies that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q^{-1} = Q^T\)&lt;/span&gt;. Most linear algebra libraries don’t even have to explicitly copy a matrix to take a transpose but simply set a flag that indicates that from now on it will operate on it row-wise instead of column-wise or vice versa. That means taking a transpose is free for all intents and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Rx = Q^T b\)&lt;/span&gt; easy to solve? Well, the right-hand side is just a vector. R is upper triangular, so we can solve this with a technique called back-substitution. Back-substitution is easiest to explain with an example. Consider this system of equations in matrix form, where the matrix is upper-triangular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 3 \\\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 4 \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ 8 \\ \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start on the bottom row, which is simply an equation &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(4x_3 = 8\)&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_3 = 2\)&lt;/span&gt;. The second row represents the equation &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_2 + x_3 =2\)&lt;/span&gt;, but we already know &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_3\)&lt;/span&gt;, so we can substitute that back in to get &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_2 - 2 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_2 = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;. The top row is &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(2x_1 + x_2 + 3_x3 = 2x_1 + 6 = 2\)&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x_1 = -2\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is back-substitution, and it should be clear that we can do this quickly and efficiently for an upper-triangular matrix of any size. Furthermore, because we do at most one division per row, this method is very numerically stable. (If the matrix is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_number&quot;&gt;ill-conditioned&lt;/a&gt;, we could still run into numerical error, but this only occurs when the original data set &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; suffers from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity&quot;&gt;multicollinearity&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So hopefully you’re convinced by now that the &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(QR\)&lt;/span&gt; form is desirable. But how do we calculate &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt;? There are two parts to understanding the algorithm. First, note that the product of any two orthogonal matrices is itself orthogonal. Also, the identity matrix is orthogonal. Therefore, if we have a candidate decomposition &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A = QR\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt; is orthogonal (but R may not yet be square), then for any orthogonal matrix &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; we have &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A = Q I R = Q S^T S R = (Q S^T) (S R) = Q' R'\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q' = Q S^T\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R' = S R\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a candidate decomposition! This is the general strategy behind not just QR decomposition, but behind many other decompositions in linear algebra: at each step we want to apply an orthogonal transformation designed to bring &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; closer to the desired form, while simultaneously keeping track of all the transformations applied so far in a single matrix &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sets the rules and the goal of the game: we can apply any sequence of orthogonal transforms to a (square, non-singular) matrix &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; that will bring it into upper triangular form. But what orthogonal transform will do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;householder-reflections&quot; class=&quot;section level2&quot; readability=&quot;84.060352554526&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Householder Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it down into an even easier problem first. How would I make &lt;em&gt;just one column&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; zero below the diagonal? Or even more concretely, how would I make just the &lt;em&gt;first column&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(A\)&lt;/span&gt; zero except for the first element?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the “column view” of our matrix. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \begin{bmatrix} \vert &amp;amp; \vert &amp;amp; \vert \\ a_1 &amp;amp; a_2 &amp;amp; a_3 \\ \vert &amp;amp; \vert &amp;amp; \vert \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(a_1\)&lt;/span&gt; to be zero except for the first element. What does that &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? Let’s call our basis vectors &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(e_1 = [1\, 0\, 0]^T\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(e_2 = [0\, 1\, 0]^T\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(e_3 = [0\, 0\, 1]^T\)&lt;/span&gt;. Every vector in our space is a linear combination of these basis vectors. So what it means for &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(a_1\)&lt;/span&gt; to be zero except for the first element is that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(a_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is co-linear (in the same line) as &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(e_1\)&lt;/span&gt;: $ H a_i = e_i$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to do this with an orthogonal transformation. But orthogonal transformations are &lt;em&gt;length preserving&lt;/em&gt;. That means &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\alpha = ||a_1||\)&lt;/span&gt;. Therefore we need to find an orthogonal matrix that sends the vector &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(a_1\)&lt;/span&gt; to the vector &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(||a_1|| e_1\)&lt;/span&gt;. Note that any two vectors lie in a plane. We could either &lt;em&gt;rotate&lt;/em&gt; by the angle between the vectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \cos^{-1} \frac{a_1 \cdot e_1}{||a_1||} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or we can &lt;em&gt;reflect&lt;/em&gt; across the line which bisects the two vectors in their plane. These two strategies are called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givens_rotation&quot;&gt;Givens rotation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Householder_transformation&quot;&gt;Householder reflection&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The rotation matrix is slightly less stable, so we will use the Householder reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; is the unit normal vector of a plane; how would I reflect an arbitrary vector &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; across that plane? Well, if we subtracted &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\langle x, v \rangle v\)&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt;, that would be a projection into the plane, right? So, if we just keep going the same direction and for the same distance again, we’ll end up a point on the other side of the plane &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x'\)&lt;/span&gt;. Both &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x'\)&lt;/span&gt; project to the same point on the plane, and furthermore both are a distance &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\langle x, v \rangle\)&lt;/span&gt; from the plane. In other words, this operation is a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram from Wikipedia illustrates this beautifully. Stare at it until you can &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; that reflecting about the dotted plane sends &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(||x||e_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; is a unit vector orthogonal to the dotted plane of reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a reflection is a linear transformation, we can express it as a matrix, which we will call &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(H\)&lt;/span&gt;. Here is how we go from our geometric intuition to a matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ \begin{align} H x &amp;amp; \triangleq x - 2 \langle x, v \rangle v \\ &amp;amp; = x - 2v \langle x, v \rangle \\ &amp;amp; = Ix - 2 v (v^T x) \\ &amp;amp; = Ix - 2 (v v^T) x \\ &amp;amp; = (I - 2 (v v^T)) x \end{align} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, note that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(v v^T\)&lt;/span&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;outer&lt;/em&gt; product of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; with itself so is a square matrix with elements &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(v_i v_j\)&lt;/span&gt;. For example, if &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(v = [\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, 0]^T\)&lt;/span&gt; (the 45° line in the xy-plane) we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ H = I - 2 v v^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} - 2 \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} &amp;amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp;amp; 0 \\\ \frac{1}{2} &amp;amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; -1 &amp;amp; 0 \\\ -1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know how to define reflections which zero out the subdiagonal of a target columns, and we know how to construct orthogonal matrices which perform that reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implementing the Lemmas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the above theoretical presentation, and copious inline comments, I hope you will now be able to read and understand the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

    # equadistant to both a and ||a|| e. This is our
    # plane of reflection. We normalize u to v to 
    # because a unit vector is required in the next step.
    u = a - np.sign(a[0]) * np.linalg.norm(a) * e

    H = np.eye(len(a)) - 2 * np.outer(v, v)
    
    return H&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the householder reflection in hand, we can implement an iterative version of the QR decomposition algorithm, using the Householder reflection on each column in turn to transform &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; into an upper triangular matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

        H[i:, i:] = householder_reflection(r, e)

        # QR = A is invariant. Proof:
        # QR = A, H^T H = I =&amp;gt; 
        # Q H^T H R = A =&amp;gt;
        # Q' = Q H^T, R' = H R =&amp;gt;
        # Q' R' = A. QED.
        #
        # By construction, the first column of the 
        # minor matrix now has zeros for all
        # subdiagonal matrix. By induction, we 
        # have that all subdiagonal elements in
        # columns j&amp;lt;=i are zero. When i=N, R
        # is upper triangular. 
        Q = Q @ H.T
        R = H @ R
    
    return Q, R&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle is back-substitution. This is straightforward and available in standard libraries, but to comply with the letter-of-law of the “from scratch” challenge we’ll implement our own version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def solve_triangular(A, b):
    '''
    Solves the equation Ax = b when A is an upper-triangular square matrix
    and b is a one dimensional vector by back-substitution. The length of b
    and the number of rows must match. Returns x as a one-dimensional numpy.ndarray
    of the same length as b.
    
    This isn't as micro-optimized as scipy.linalg.solve_triangular() but the
    algorithm is the same, and the asymptotic time complexity is the same.  
    '''
    
    # starting at the bottom, the last row is just a_N_N * x = b_N
    n, m = A.shape
    x = b[(m-1):m] / A[m-1, m-1]
    
    for i in range(m - 2, -1, -1):
        back_substitutions = np.dot(A[i, (i+1):], x)
        rhs = b[i] - back_substitutions
        x_i = rhs / A[i, i]  # possible ill-conditioning warning?
        x = np.insert(x, 0, x_i)
  
    return x&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t lie - that was a ton of linear algebra we just ploughed through. If you got through it, or if you had the good sense to skim ahead until you found something that made sense, congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we move on to actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; our new functions, let’s spend some time making sure everything up to this point is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our trusty tools in hand, we’re ready to tackle linear regression properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;implementing-linear-regression&quot; class=&quot;section level2&quot; readability=&quot;58&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementing Linear Regression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that our problem was to solve the normal equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ X^T X \hat{\Theta} = X^T y \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we now let &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(QR\)&lt;/span&gt; be the QR-decomposition of &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ (R^T Q^T)(Q R) \hat{\Theta} = R^T Q^T y \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q\)&lt;/span&gt; is orthogonal, &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(Q^T Q = I\)&lt;/span&gt; and we can simplify this to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ R^T R \hat{\Theta} = R^T Q^T y \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next step, we have to assume the &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; is invertible. This is always the case if our original &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; was free of multicollinearity. It is also equivalent to &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X^T X\)&lt;/span&gt; being invertible so the naive approach of taking &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((X^T X)^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt; isn’t any stronger. Even gradient descent has issues with singular matrices because the problem is no longer strongly convex. There is a method based on SVD (singular value decomposition) which can handle linear regression in the presence of multicollinearity but it’s slower and in general the whole problem is better handled by removing redundant features or adding regularization, neither of which are in scope for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy goes to the doctor and says, “Doctor, it hurts when I perform linear regression on a dataset with strong or perfect multicollinearity.” The doctor says, “don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, let’s just assume that &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt; exists. We don’t actually have to calculate it, though! The mere fact of its existence lets us left multiply both sides of the equation by &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\((R^T)^{-1}\)&lt;/span&gt; and cancel the &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R^T\)&lt;/span&gt; on both sides, leaving only:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;math display&quot;&gt;\[ R \hat{\Theta} = Q^T y \]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(R\)&lt;/span&gt; is an upper triangular matrix, we can use our &lt;code&gt;solve_triangular()&lt;/code&gt; function to solve this equation very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final algorithm is deceptively simple. Compare the normal equations derived above to the final two lines of the &lt;code&gt;fit()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;class LinearRegression:
    def __init__(self, add_intercept=True):
        self.add_intercept = bool(add_intercept)

    def _design_matrix(self, X):
        if self.add_intercept:
            X = np.hstack([ np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X])
        return X

    def fit(self, X, y):
        X = self._design_matrix(X)
        Q, R = qr_decomposition(X)
        self.theta_hat = solve_triangular(R, Q.T @ y)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        X = self._design_matrix(X)
        return X @ self.theta_hat&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;testing&quot; class=&quot;section level2&quot; readability=&quot;97.351711026616&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that while we follow the scikit-learn naming conventions, up to this point we haven’t imported anything from sklearn. That’s in keeping with the “from scratch” challenge. However, to &lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt; the code, we are going to use a few sklearn and scipy dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first grab a bunch of test-only dependencies and also grab a copy of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/Boston.html&quot;&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; data set so we have a simple regression problem to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# testing purposes only
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
import matplotlib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from numpy.linalg import det
from scipy.stats import ortho_group
import unittest
from numpy.testing import assert_allclose

boston = load_boston()
X_raw = boston.data
y_raw = boston.target

# shuffle the data to randomize the train/test split
shuffle = np.random.permutation(len(y_raw))
X_full = X_raw[shuffle].copy()
y_full = y_raw[shuffle].copy()

# 80/20 train/test split. 
train_test_split = int(0.8 * len(y_full))
X_train = X_full[:train_test_split, :]
y_train = y_full[:train_test_split]
X_test = X_full[train_test_split:, :]
y_test = y_full[train_test_split:]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is fit to the training set only. If it fits the training set pretty well we know it has learned the examples we gave it; if it &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; fits the test set pretty well, we know it’s done more than just memorize the examples given but has also learned a more general lesson that it can apply to novel data that it’s never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to visualize model performance is to plot &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; vs. &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt; - in other words, actual vs predicted. A perfect predictor would be a 45° diagonal through the origin; random guessing would be a shapeless or circular cloud of points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

def goodness_of_fit_report(label, model, X, y):
    y_hat = model.predict(X)
    
    # predicted-vs-actual plot
    plt.scatter(x=y, y=y_hat, label=label, alpha=0.5)
    plt.title(&quot;Predicted vs. Actual&quot;)
    plt.xlabel(&quot;Actual&quot;)
    plt.ylabel(&quot;Predictions&quot;)
    plt.legend()
    
    mse = np.mean( (y - y_hat)**2 )
    y_bar = np.mean(y)
    r2 = 1 - np.sum( (y-y_hat)**2 ) / np.sum( (y-y_bar)**2 )
    print(&quot;{label: &amp;lt;16} mse={mse:.2f}     r2={r2:.2f}&quot;.format(**locals()))
        
plt.figure(figsize=(16,6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
goodness_of_fit_report(&quot;Training Set&quot;, model, X_train, y_train)
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
goodness_of_fit_report(&quot;Test Set&quot;, model, X_test, y_test)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training Set mse=21.30 r2=0.73&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Set mse=25.12 r2=0.75&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in point of fact this linear regression model does reasonably well on both the train and test set, with correlation scores around 75%. That means it’s able to explain about three-quarters of the variation that it finds in &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; from what it was able to learn about the relationship between &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good idea to visualize actual responses &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; and predictions &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt; as a function of the independent variables &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt;. In this case &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; is 13-dimensional so hard to visualized fully, so we will simply choose a few random pairs of dimensions dimensions so we can work in 2D. If the model has learned anything real about the relationship between &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(X\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;, we should see two similar clouds of points for actual &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; and predicted &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(\hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.oranlooney.com/post/ml-from-scratch-part-1-linear-regression_files/predicted_vs_actual.png&quot; alt=&quot;Prediction vs. Actual Scatterplot, training set and test set&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Prediction vs. Actual Scatterplot, training set and test set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also plot the actual and predicted response as a function of various predictors to get a sense of whether or not our function is truly fitting the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;y_hat = model.predict(X_train)
plt.figure(figsize=(16,32))
for i in range(4, 8):
    plt.subplot(6, 2, i+1)
    plt.scatter(x=X_train[:, i], y=y_train, alpha=0.2, label='Actual')
    plt.scatter(x=X_train[:, i], y=y_hat, alpha=0.2, label='Predicted')
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel(boston.feature_names[i])
    plt.ylabel(&quot;Response Variable&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.oranlooney.com/post/ml-from-scratch-part-1-linear-regression_files/scatter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Predicted vs. Actual over pairs of independent variables&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Predicted vs. Actual over pairs of independent variables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eyeball test confirms that this model is fitting the data rather well, just as we’d expect when &lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(r^2 = 0.75\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;conclusion&quot; class=&quot;section level2&quot; readability=&quot;37.497009966777&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was linear regression from scratch. There’s a lot more that could be said about linear regression even as a black box predictive model: polynomial and interaction terms, L1 and L2 regularization, and linear constraints on coefficients come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a whole universe of techniques for doing statistical modeling and inference with linear regression: testing residuals for homoscedasticity, normality, autocorrelation, variance inflation factors, orthogonal polynomial regression, Cook’s distance, leverage, Studentized residuals, ANOVA, AIC, BIC, Omnibus F-tests on nested models, etc., etc. Just to be clear, these aren’t &lt;em&gt;variations&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;generalization&lt;/em&gt; of linear regression (although there are tons of those too) these are just standard techniques for analyzing and understanding linear regression models of the exact same form we calculated above. The topic is very mature and a huge amount of auxiliary mathematical machinery has been built up over the centuries (Gauss was studying OLS around 1800, and the problem is older than that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we go too deeply into linear regression, we won’t get a chance to explore the rest of machine learning. So for the next part of the series, we will switch our attention to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oranlooney.com/post/ml-from-scratch-part-2-logistic-regression/&quot;&gt;logistic regression&lt;/a&gt; and use that as an excuse to explore &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent&quot;&gt;SGD&lt;/a&gt; in some detail. That will then serve as a jumping off point for our first “real” (or at least in fashion) machine learning algorithm in part 3: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oranlooney.com/post/ml-from-scratch-part-3-backpropagation/&quot;&gt;neural networks and backpropagation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>To kick off this series, will start with something simple yet foundational: linear regression via ordinary least squares. While not exciting, linear regression finds widespread use both as a standalone learning algorithm and as a building block in more advanced learning algorithms. The output layer of a deep neural network trained for regression with MSE loss, simple AR time series models, and the “local regression” part of LOWESS smoothing are all examples of linear regression being used as an ingredient in a more sophisticated model.</og:description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#13;
                        &amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&lt;span class=&quot;TextFieldDisplay-ascx&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    &amp;#13;
        ​A research group at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, has developed an efficient process for breaking down any plastic waste to a molecular level. The resulting gases can then be transformed back into new plastics – of the same quality as the original. The new process could transform today's plastic factories into recycling refineries, within the framework of their existing infrastructure.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;166.92536542153&quot;&gt;
                        

&lt;span class=&quot;TextFieldDisplay-ascx&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    
        ​&lt;span&gt;The fact that plastics do not break down, and therefore accumulate in our ecosystems, is one of our major environmental problems. But at Chalmers, a research group led by Henrik Thunman, Professor of Energy Technology, sees the resilience of plastic as an asset. The fact that it does not degrade makes it possible for circular usage, creating a true value for used plastic, and therefore an economic impetus to collect it.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We should not forget that plastic is a fantastic material – it gives us products that we could otherwise only dream of. The problem is that it is manufactured at such low cost, that it has been cheaper to produce new plastics from oil and fossil gas than from reusing plastic waste,” says Henrik Thunman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, through experimenting with chemical recovery via steam cracking of plastic, the researchers have developed an efficient process for turning used plastics into plastics of virgin quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Through finding the right temperature – which is around 850 degrees Celsius – and the right heating rate and residence time, we have been able to demonstrate the proposed method at a scale where we turn 200 kg of plastic waste an hour into a useful gas mixture. That can then be recycled at the molecular level to become new plastic materials of virgin quality,” says Henrik Thunman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiments were carried out at the Chalmers Power Central facility in Gothenburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, around 350 million tonnes of plastic waste were generated worldwide. In total, 14 per cent was collected for material recovery – 8 per cent was recycled into plastic of lower quality, and 2 per cent to plastics of similar quality as the original. Around 4 per cent was lost in the process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, around 40 per cent of global plastic waste in 2015 was processed after collection, mainly through incineration for energy recovery or volume reduction – releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest – about 60 per cent – went to landfill. Only around 1 per cent was left uncollected and leaked into natural environments. Though only a small percentage, this nevertheless represents a significant environmental problem, since the amount of plastic waste is so high overall, and since the natural degradation of plastic is so slow, it accumulates over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9.8666666666667&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chalmers.se/SiteCollectionDocuments/SEE/News/Graphic-summary-ENG.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.chalmers.se/SiteCollectionImages/Institutioner/SEE/Nyheter/graphic_summary_220.jpg&quot; class=&quot;chalmersPosition-FloatRight&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;The current model for recycling plastic tends to follow what is known as the ‘waste hierarchy’. This means the plastic is repeatedly degraded, to lower and lower quality before finally being burned for energy recovery.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Instead of this, we focused on capturing the carbon atoms from the collected plastic and using them to create new plastic of original quality – that is, back to the top of the waste hierarchy, creating real circularity.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, brand new plastics are made by shattering fossil oil and gas fractions in a device known as a ‘cracker’ in petrochemical plants. Inside the cracker, building blocks consisting of simple molecules are created. These can then be combined in many different configurations, resulting in the enormous variety of plastics we see in our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the same from collected plastics, new processes need to be developed. What the Chalmers researchers now present are the technical aspects of how such a process could be designed and integrated into existing petrochemical plants, in a cost-effective way. Eventually, this kind of development could enable a hugely significant transformation of today's petrochemical plants into recycling refineries of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are continuing their work on the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are now moving on from the initial trials, which aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the process, to focusing on developing more detailed understanding. This knowledge is needed to scale up the process from a few tonnes of plastic a day, to hundreds of tonnes. That is when it becomes commercially interesting,” says Henrik Thunman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chalmersElement-H3&quot;&gt;More about: The Chalmer​s researchers' method and its potential&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is applicable to all types of plastic that result from our waste system, including those that have historically been stored in landfills or at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes it now feasible to use collected and sorted plastics in large-scale petrochemical plants is that a sufficient volume of material is collected, meaning that the plants can theoretically maintain the same output. These plants require around 1-2 million tonnes of sorted plastic waste per year to convert to match the production levels they currently derive from oil and fossil gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden's total amount of plastic waste in 2017 was around 1.6 million tonnes. Only around 8 percent of that was recycled to lower quality plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chalmers researchers therefore see an opportunity to create a circular use of plastic in society, as well as free us from the need for oil and fossil gas to produce various high-quality plastics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Circular use would help give used plastics a true value, and thus an economic impetus for collecting it anywhere on earth. In turn, this would help minimise release of plastic into nature, and create a market for collection of plastic that has already polluted the natural environment, says Henrik Thunman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-of-life bio-based materials like paper, wood and clothes could also be used as raw material in the chemical process. This would mean we could gradually reduce the proportion of fossil materials in plastic. We could also create net negative emissions, if carbon dioxide is also captured in the process. The vision is to create a sustainable, circular system for carbon-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chalmersElement-H3&quot;&gt;More about: Chalmers Power Central​&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chalmers Power Central (CPC) is an advanced research facility focusing on carbon capture and conversion of biomass and waste. The power plant attracts researchers and industry from all over the world, who want to contribute to a sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chalmersElement-H3&quot;&gt;More about: The research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research results have been published in the journal Sustainable Materials and Technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of the article are Henrik Thunman, Teresa Berdugo Vilches, Martin Seemann, Jelena Maric, Isabel Cañete Vela, Sébastien Pissot and Huong N.T.Nguyen. At the time of the research, all of them worked at the Department of Space, Earth and Environment at Chalmers University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work has been carried out with financial support from the Swedish Energy Agency through the projects &lt;em&gt;Innovative transformation processes at Chalmers power plant&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Material recovery of plastic fractions via thermal conversion&lt;/em&gt;, as well as the Swedish gasification centre.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Alphabet’s Wing begins making commercial drone deliveries in the US</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/alphabet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;alphabet&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;-owned drone delivery spin-out Wing is starting to service U.S. customers, after becoming the first drone delivery company to get the federal go-ahead to do so earlier this year. Wing is working with FedEx Express and &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/walgreens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;walgreens&quot;&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; on this pilot, and their first customers are Michael and Kelly Collver, who will get a “cough and cold pack,” which includes Tylenol, cough drops, facial tissues, Emergen-C and bottled water (do people who have colds need bottled water?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Collvers are receiving their package in Christianburg, Va., which is where Wing and &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/walgreens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;walgreens&quot;&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; will run this inaugural pilot of the drone delivery service. Walgreens gets a noteworthy credit in the bargain, becoming the first U.S. retailer to do a store-to-customer doorstep delivery via drone, while FedEx will be the first logistics provider to deliver an e-commerce drone delivery with a separate shipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wing is also working with Virginia’s Sugar Magnolia, a retailer local to the state, and that part of the equation is focused on proving out how Wing and drone delivery can service last-mile e-commerce customers at their homes. Sugar Magnolia customers can get small items, including chocolates and paper goods, delivered directly to them via drone through the new pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1899791&quot; title=&quot;Wing drone delivery (3)&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wing drone delivery 3&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Wing-drone-delivery-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wing was able to do this with a new Air Carrier Certificate from the FAA that clears it for expanded service, specifically allowing Wing’s pilots to manage multiple aircraft flying without any human pilot on board at the same time, while providing service to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a big milestone when it comes to U.S.-based drone delivery, and another sign that people should get ready for these services to start to be a more regular fixture. Earlier this month, UPS also secured FAA approval to operate a commercial drone delivery service, so the trials will probably come fast and furious at this point — though widespread service is probably still quite a ways off as both regulators and operators look to learn from their first limited deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Are Aerospike Engines Better Than Traditional Rocket Engines?</title>
<link>http://everydayastronaut.com/aerospikes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://everydayastronaut.com/aerospikes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed//D4SaofKCYwo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10261&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Dialogue-Part-timeline.06_13_39_22.Still001-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;F-1 Rocket engine size scale human Infinity Science Center Stennis Space Center Tim Dodd Everyday Astronaut&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a rocket engine. Really, all it is is a heat and pressure machine whose end goal is to convert that heat and pressure into workable thrust. The more that gets converted the better.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This conversion is usually done by a large bell nozzle. That’s the job of every single centimeter of this giant nozzle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The further down the nozzle you go, the lower the pressure and temperature of the exhaust gets and the more it’s exchanged for higher and higher exhaust velocities.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So in general, you want this nozzle to be as big as possible in order for it to convert as much of that energy as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only one problem. When the exhaust pressure at the end of the nozzle gets below the pressure of the outside ambient air surrounding, the ambient air actually starts to squeeze in on the exhaust gas.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Lower the pressure too much and the ambient air will squeeze in on the exhaust so much that it will actually start to peel the exhaust off the nozzle walls and form random shock waves and spikes that will tear apart the engine.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So what if you turned an engine inside out and made it so the ambient air pressure is actually pushing the exhaust IN against the nozzle instead of squeezing the exhaust away from the nozzle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10328&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_00_22_20.Still091.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;XRS-2200 Aerospike engine stennis infinity science center&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well that’s the theory behind the aerospike engine. Not only do they do exactly this, they also promise to increase engine efficiency throughout ascent because that inside out nozzle inherently forms a nearly perfect shape for the exhaust to follow at any altitude, increasing their efficiency at all altitudes. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And with engineers relentlessly trying to optimize rockets in a world where even a 1% improvement is a massive leap, the aerospike engine seems like a dream come true!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Throughout history, there have been a number of aerospikes that have made it really far in development, but to date, none have ever really flown, let alone been used on an orbital class rocket…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;If they’re so good, shouldn’t everyone be using them, or for that matter, shouldn’t ANYONE be using them? Why aren’t new generation engines that are built from the ground up like SpaceX’s Raptor engine, aerospikes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10327&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_00_59_02.Still093.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Linear aerospike rocketdyne&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So today we’re going to look at the history of aerospike engines, go over how nozzles work including things like overexpansion, underexpansion and even expansion ratios, we’ll look at the pros and cons of the aerospike, the physical limitations and problems, then we’ll compare the aerospike to some other traditional rocket engines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But that’s not all, I obtained never seen before photos and videos of some aerospikes, we’ll get opinions from some people who have actually worked with aerospike engines, look at some promising prospects and compelling concepts and by the end of the video we’ll hopefully know whether or not the holy grail of rocket engines is just waiting to be utilized or if aerospikes just simply aren’t worth it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Put on your favorite aerospike engine shirt, grab some popcorn a drink and maybe a notepad, cuz this one’s a long one and we have a LOT to cover…  Let’s get started!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those of you that follow me on Twitter have probably been watching this article come together and likely have noticed my tone on this subject has changed from “aerospikes SUCK” to a more neutral stance on the subject…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And wow, after months of research, this article turned out to be a monster. I mean, we ended up going through literally dozens and dozens of hard to find documents to track down the numbers for aerospike engines from their source. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And although it took a while (sorry), the more I learned the more I realized I how much more I needed to learn and the more context I knew would need to be put into this article to make it understandable… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After I posted my “&lt;a href=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/raptor-engine/&quot;&gt;Is SpaceX’s Raptor engine the king of rocket engines&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/why-single-stage-to-orbit-rockets-suck-the-wacky-history-and-future-maybes-of-sstos/&quot;&gt;Why SSTOs suck&lt;/a&gt;” articles, I got so many people claiming that the real holy grail of rockets is actually the aerospike…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And you’re not wrong. I mean, an engine that magically (thanks to physics) is inherently more efficient at almost any altitude? An engine that works as well at sea level as a perfectly tuned sea level engine bell and still performs just as well in a vacuum as a large vacuum bell? Wow, YES sign me up!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why isn’t there more love for aerospikes in the aerospace industry? I mean after all, SpaceX engineers tackled the ultimate challenge by developing a methane powered full flow staged combustion cycle engine… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you can solve that crazy engine, why didn’t they try for an aerospike, something that promises some pretty substantial gains AND they’ve already been fully developed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After all, aerospikes definitely aren’t new. They actually go back to the 60’s when engineers were looking for ways to improve upon some early rocket engines. Keep in mind, the engines at this point in time were relatively primitive, so the promise of an aerospike engine was extra appealing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10321&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-10321&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10321 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_04_19_01.Still099.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;J-2T Toroidal aerospike engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-10321&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rocketdyne J-2T toroidal aerospike engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe the most notable and promising aerospike was an aerospike version of the J-2 engine that powered the second and third stage of the Saturn V. This was called the J-2T and on paper it seemed to be a nice and compact version of the J-2 while offering even greater vacuum efficiency than the standard J-2.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Although it hit the test stand 34 times and had some promising potential, it was shelved alongside the Saturn V and any potential upgrade path thereof once the Space Shuttle program began.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;BUT it was actually considered for use as the space shuttle main engine, but as we know, NASA went with a closed cycle bell nozzled engine, the RS-25. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10319&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_04_38_15.Still101.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Spaceshuttle with aerospikes&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rocketdyne also took spare parts from the J-2 and the simplified J-2s rocket engines and developed a linear aerospike engine known as the L-1 linear test bed from 1970 to 1972 and had 44 tests with 3,113 seconds of operation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It would be almost 30 years before the concept would be dusted off again and looked at with any serious consideration, and this time it was for a space shuttle replacement known as Venture Star. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Venture Star was a rocket nerds ultimate dream rocket, a single stage to orbit or SSTO, fully reusable space plane that was to utilize linear aerospike engines called the RS-2200, that not only made it look like the millenium Falcon, but it also promised nearly the same payload capability to low earth orbit as the space shuttle it was intended to replace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10317&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_05_17_28.Still103.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;X33 Venturestar&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to minimize risk, Lockheed Martin began development of a suborbital demonstration version of the Venturestar called the X-33 which was to use a smaller testbed version of the RS-2200 called the xRS-2200. It was fully operational and had accumulated 17 tests and about 1,600 seconds of test stand operation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But because of the overly ambitious use of super advanced carbon composite tanks, a few other technologies that had yet to be perfected, and some interesting politics, Lockheed Martin may have bit off more than they could chew. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Venturestar program and the X-33 along with the RS-2200 and xRS-2200 linear aerospike engines were put on the shelf in 2001. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok, so what the heck. Is the aerospike just a bad luck engine? Being assigned only to programs which are destined to be cancelled? Why aren’t any of these plans being resurrected now with more modern technologies? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well let’s first get into how they work, and in order to do so, we should do a quick overview of how and why a traditional bell nozzle works so we know how to compare them against aerospikes. After all, the physics are the same between aerospikes and bell nozzles… so let’s dive in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rockets work by taking a high pressure gas with molecules traveling in all directions and turning that pressure into a high velocity flow in a very specific direction, and if all things are going smoothly, the direction of the flow is exactly opposite of the direction the rocket is pointing…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10316&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_07_08_18.Still104.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we talked about in my video about the Raptor engine, the chamber pressure in rocket engines can be unbelievably high. SpaceX’s raptor engine is currently the king of chamber pressure at 270 bar and they’re aiming for 300 bar.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Just to put into perspective how much pressure that is, that’s like putting a BMW 740i Sedan which weighs nearly 2 tonnes and placing it on something not much bigger than an average sized US Postage stamp!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10315&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_07_43_03.Still105.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chamber pressure&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s how much pressure is pushing on every single square inch of the combustion chamber. To convert that pressure, engineers developed something called a converging-diverging nozzle, or a de Laval nozzle, that converts those high-pressure gas molecules traveling in all directions to a high-velocity gas moving in one direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now we’re about to go to fluid dynamic city here real quick, and not just any old fluid dynamics but super nutty stuff where everything gets backwards and upside down as we’re going to transition from a subsonic high pressure hot gas into a supersonic low pressure cooler gas.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So if our combustion chamber was just a tube coming off the injector, we’d end up with some hot gas moving out pretty fast, but not super sonic. And fun reminder here about rocket engines and rocket engine efficiency, the faster the exhaust gas is ejected, the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to accelerate a gas moving through a tube, we can actually shrink the size of the tube. The same amount of mass will pass through this smaller area, and in order to do so, it needs to speed up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10312&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_08_56_16.Still108.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think the best example of this is a standard old garden hose. Turn it on and put your thumb over the end of the hose. Ignoring a few potential loses, the same amount of water will flow through the hose regardless if your thumb is covering the end or not.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The only thing that changes is the water has to speed up to move the same volume of water through a smaller hole. Remove your thumb and the water slows down, but both methods would fill up a bucket in the same amount of time. One will just be a lot more splashy than the other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the same thing applies with passing gas through a tube. We can keep shrinking the tube until we get to the point where the gas is traveling at sonic speeds, or at the local speed of sound. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I say local speed of sound because the speed of sound goes up with the square root of temperature and because the temperature in rocket engines is REALLY high, the speed of sound at the throat can be 5 to 10 times that of room temperature at sea level! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once the exhaust gas is traveling at the speed of sound, we can’t actually shrink the tube anymore because here’s where things get quite literally backwards. Once a gas is traveling at the speed of sound, if you shrink the tube anymore, you simply end up choking it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So from this point on, engineers design the nozzle to be a perfect shape which will convert thermal energy into kinetic energy. As the walls of the nozzle gets wider, it actually accelerates the gas, and the pressure and temperature lowers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10311&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_10_10_28.Still109.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;nozzle efficiency rocket engine expansion&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you make the nozzle big enough, you’ll get to the point where the exhaust is actually at the same pressure as the ambient air outside, or in the case of sea level, 1 bar of pressure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s actually amazing to me we can go all the way from hundreds of bar of pressure down to less than 1 bar in such a relatively short distance. And it’s also weird that even though the gas is moving at unbelievable speeds, the exhaust pressure can actually get really low.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And the lower pressure we can get the exhaust gas, the more we’ll have converted high pressure into high gas velocity, which is desirable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But as a rocket climbs in altitude, the ambient air pressure outside of the rocket lowers… so the pressure at the end of the nozzle becomes higher and higher than ambient pressure. You can see their plumes expanding out in all directions once the rocket is in the vacuum of space.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This is why vacuum optimized nozzles are so freaking big. The perfect example of this is SpaceX’s Merlin engine which has the same combustion chamber between the sea level version and the vacuum version.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10307&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_11_06_13.Still113.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Merlin sea level and vacuum&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The sea level version with its sea level nozzle is small enough that SpaceX can fit 9 of them around the 3.7 meter wide Falcon 9. But the upper stage vacuum engine has only one engine because the vacuum nozzle’s bell is about 3 meters wide! Just look at how snuggly it fits inside the interstage of the Falcon 9.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;You can tell whether or not the nozzle is optimal for the altitude it’s at by looking at the exhaust coming out of the nozzle. A nozzle that’s perfectly matching the atmosphere will have exhaust shooting straight out in a perfectly expanded plume.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10306&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_11_17_19.Still114.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Falcon 9 vacuum engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the nozzle is too small for the altitude, it’s called being under-expanded and you can see the exhaust immediately getting wider as soon as it exits the nozzle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the exhaust is traveling out away from the rocket at all, that’s energy literally being spent thrown out the sides. You want the exhaust traveling as straight as possible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Again, you can easily see this with first stages of rockets, as the rocket climbs in altitude, it’s engine’s exhaust plume gets wider and wider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10304&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_11_47_06.Still116.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;underexpanded nozzle rocket bell&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At sea level, nozzles are virtually always too big and that’s called being over expanded. You can tell when a rocket’s nozzle is overexpanded because the exhaust gets squeezed tighter by the ambient air as it exits the nozzle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and will even form shock waves known as mach diamonds as the pressure grows and then expands.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So you might think, why don’t they just use vacuum optimized nozzles at sea level&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;since rockets only spend their first few seconds at sea level, ambient air pressure drops in HALF by only about 5,000 meters, and they spend most of their time in the vacuum of space?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10305&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_11_29_12.Still115.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;overexpanded nozzle rocket bell&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But remember, the further away the nozzle exit pressure is from ambient pressure, the less efficient it is. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So a sea level engine in a vacuum is inefficient and a vacuum engine at sea level is inefficient, but there’s actually another, even bigger reason why you usually can’t use a vacuum engine at sea level, because the nozzle would likely break due to something called flow separation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is where the ambient air squeezes in against the flow of the exhaust and it actually climbs up into the nozzle, and it does that so much that it can create shock waves and sudden pressure spikes called flow separation which will most likely damage the nozzle.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;A nozzle can really only go down to about 40% overexpanded before you get flow separation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10300&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_13_05_20.Still120.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;flow separation overexpansion&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well, that is unless you look at the Space Shuttle Main Engines, the RS-25 which used a unique trick to curl the nozzle walls in ever so slightly which allowed them to get down to about 14% overexpanded without flow separation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This made them more efficient throughout the entire 8 and a half minute ascent since they fired from sea level and stayed running all the way into orbit. And considering how little amount of time is spent at sea level, maximizing nozzle design for the vacuum of space was definitely a good thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10303&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_12_04_25.Still117.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;overexpanded nozzle rocket bell&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is still just weird to think that just regular old air at sea level can be higher pressure and actually squeeze in on rocket exhaust. But the pressure at the tip of the nozzle is actually pretty low, it’s just moving very very fast. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But even if you have a huge vacuum nozzle like the vacuum Merlin 1D, it’s still too small for the vacuum of space. If it were to match the ambient vacuum pressure, the nozzle would need to be infinitely long… and since that doesn’t sound like it’d be very light weight or fit inside our universe, engineers find the happy medium between packaging, mass and performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The term for how big the throat of the combustion chamber is compared to the exit of the bell is known as the expansion ratio. This is the ratio between the area of the throat vs the area of the nozzle exit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, for ease of reference, let’s look at SpaceX’s Merlin engine which has the same chamber and throat diameter, but with different bells.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;A sea level merlin has a nozzle that’s 0.91 meter wide (36 inches) where as the Merlin Vacuum engine has a 2.89 meter wide (114”) nozzle. Since both engines have the same throat of 226mm (8.9”), this means the sea level Merlin has an expansion ratio of 16:1 while the Merlin Vacuum engine has an expansion ratio of 164:1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10299&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_15_15_21.Still121.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Expansion ratios merlin spacex engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think we tend to look at a rocket engine’s nozzle and go “look at that HUGE ROCKET ENGINE”… when really, we’re seeing the most insignificant piece of the engine. As a matter of fact, many rockets we see on display are missing the actual engines or turbo pumps and just have dummy mock up nozzles.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So when you hear someone say, “check out these huge engines” you can push your glasses up on your nose and say “the final size of the nozzle has only to do with the expansion ratio of the engine and it does not necessarily correspond to the output of the engine”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s kind of like pointing to the wheels of a car and saying “Look at that engine!” Because just like how the wheels of a car transmits the energy of the engine to the road, the nozzle converts the energy of the rocket engine into the workable thrust. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok, so you can’t really fire a vacuum optimized engine at sea level… and this, really, is where aerospikes come in. The idea behind aerospikes is you allow the ambient air pressure to actually form the walls containing the flow of the exhaust so it’s always in nearly ideal conditions at any altitude.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And not only will you not destroy your engine by lighting it at sea level, it’ll actually perform pretty darn well!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And again, I know it doesn’t seem like it, because it’s what we’re used to, but at sea level, there’s actually an awful lot of air around us. And you don’t really realize how much force it exerts until you remove air from something and see how much force the atmosphere can actually apply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-10298 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_17_01_06.Still122.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aerospike ambient air pressure squeezing sea level&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So with an aerospike, the throat of the combustion chamber or chambers aims the exhaust gas at what is essentially just a slice of a traditional bell. When the engine is at sea level, the higher pressure ambient air pushes the lower pressure exhaust against the wall. I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nstead of the ambient air pressure squeezing IN on the exhaust and pushing it away from the nozzle wall, the ambient air pushes the exhaust further into the nozzle wall, which makes flow separation physically impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayastronaut.com/shop&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10336&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EA-Merch-Banner-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;everyday astronaut merch store&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;672&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the vehicle climbs in altitude, the ambient pressure decreases and so does the pressure on the exhaust flow. This essentially makes the wall that holds the exhaust grow, changing its expansion ratio with altitude.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So really, the air, or lack of air, forms the outer wall of aerospikes and due to the atmosphere getting thinner and thinner as the rocket’s altitude increases, the virtual nozzle actually grows with altitude.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But there’s still an expansion ratio for aerospike engines. This is based on how long the spike itself is. The exhaust needs to form against the spike and once it’s gone, the exhaust will expand out beyond it in a vacuum just like a traditional bell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most aerospike concepts have a flat base at the bottom, or a truncated spike, which takes the turbine exhaust and puts it through a heat exchanger and that creates a pressure zone in the wake of the rocket that actually adds a little bit of additional thrust in higher altitudes, further aiding in its traits that are advantageous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10296&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_18_08_12.Still124.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Truncated Aerospike engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to make an aerospike engine, you need a differently shaped combustion chamber than a traditional one, or multiple chambers that form the unique shape needed to make an aerospike.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;There’s two main types of aerospikes. There’s the toroidal aerospike and the linear aerospike. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10279&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_30_13_13.Still141.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Multiple chambers xrs-2200 aerospike engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the toroidal aerospike, the combustion chamber is like a donut and the throat is an opening pointing inwards-ish towards a spike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10332&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-10332&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-10332 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2075.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocketdyne J-2t toroidal aerospike&quot; width=&quot;1430&quot; height=&quot;1055&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-10332&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rocketdyne J-2T 250K Toroidal Aerospike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A linear aerospike has rows of combustion chambers that all point onto a flatter wedge shaped ramp and has at least two sides, and the exhaust ends up meeting each other at the tip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10278&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-10278&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10278&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_30_21_18.Still142.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Multiple chambers xrs-2200 aerospike engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-10278&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;XRS-2200 Linear Aerospike engine at the Infinity Science Center in Mississippi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most rocket concepts that utilize an aerospike engine are single stage to orbit concepts, that is a rocket that is only one stage and goes straight from sea level to orbit with no separation events. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now I’ve already done an article on why SSTOs suck, and trust me, they’re SUPER COOL, like YES I want that and maybe someday we’ll have it, but physics just simply dictates that there’s a lot better uses of rockets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After all, if the key is reuse, not putting the entire vehicle through punishing reentry forces is a good place to start, that’s why we’re seeing fully reusable concepts like SpaceX’s StarShip be HUGE multistage vehicles.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But an aerospike is a pretty good way to do a single stage to orbit rocket, since you can essentially utilize a vacuum optimized engine at sea level and not only will it not explode, it’ll operate about as well at sea level as a sea level optimized rocket engine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the math, here’s where a working aerospike can nearly double the payload capacity of an SSTO compared to a good bell nozzled engine, but more on that later when we’ll look at whether or not an aerospike truly is the best option even for SSTOs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok, so other than SSTOs, in general, if aerospikes are so great, why isn’t it being used on every rocket? Especially on first stages where the vehicle transitions from sea level to vacuum-ish conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well there’s two main issues that plague aerospikes. Weight and heat. Let’s start off with heat as it’s actually perhaps the biggest issue and it contributes to less than ideal performance AND additional weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s right, despite looking like there’s less to cool, an aerospike engine actually has a horrendous time keeping itself cool. After all, a rocket engine is basically just getting exhaust gas as hot and high pressure as you can and eventually make it all move in one direction without it melting the engine trying to contain and direct it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And an engine melting, well, means you no longer have an engine. And as soon as your rocket no longer has a working engine, it tends to fall right back to Earth in a hurry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10294&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_20_45_14.Still126.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Antares failure&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The primary way most liquid fueled rocket engines cool themselves is through a process known as regenerative cooling. This is where liquid fuel is actually piped through the walls of the combustion chamber and usually most of the nozzle as well in order to cool them down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10293&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_21_07_14.Still127.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Regenerative cooling&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s also other tricks rocket engines do to keep themselves from melting. There’s film cooling with fuel or exhaust, ablative cooling and even radiative cooling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ablative cooling, like heat shields, is where you allow parts to sublimate or ablate, and in doing so, they take heat away with them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A good example of this is the RS-68 engine that powers ULA’s Delta IV Heavy and powered the now retired Delta IV. Although it runs on liquid hydrogen just like the space shuttle, it’s exhaust isn’t clear like the space shuttle’s main engine exhaust. Instead it has this orange glow to it. That’s actually from the composite nozzle that used graphite to ablate away, taking heat with it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a little less common in modern liquid fueled rocket engines, and its of course not a good choice if you plan to reuse your engine since you likely would have burnt through the majority of it during the flight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10292&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_21_53_16.Still128.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Delta IV Heavy ablative cooling&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Film cooling can take a few forms either by injecting additional fuel inside the combustion chamber along the walls to keep those areas cooler, by pumping cooler exhaust down along the nozzle, or both. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’ve touched on the gas generator exhaust before in my article about raptor engines, but the exhaust from a gas generator or preburner is relatively cool since it needs to be a low enough temperature for the turbine to survive being subject to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s just super weird to think that you can take hot exhaust, like 1,000 C, mix it with hotter exhaust gas, like around 2,500 C, and it’ll actually end up being somewhere between the two temperatures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;My dumb brain tends to think the temperature would be the sum of the two and not be the average of the two. Take a really hot gas, add a pretty hot gas and doesn’t go to SUPER hot… good thing I’m not a rocket engineer. But hey, I guess I’m proof it’s never too late to start learning thermodynamics!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This cooler exhaust gas helps the nozzle, or usually the nozzle extension, be in contact with a cooler gas than if it were in contact with the main combustion chamber exhaust. You can see this utilized on the F-1 engine that powered the Saturn V as well as the Merlin 1D Vacuum engine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And looking at the Merlin 1D vacuum, you can see streaks in its niobium alloy nozzle which is radiatively cooled but also takes the gas generator exhaust and uses it to cool the nozzle. The streaks are from little fins inside the exhaust manifold that maintain the structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10289&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_23_06_02.Still131.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Merlin 1D Vacuum streaks &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Side note, I used to think these streaks were from the pintle injector, but come to find out, it’s from the exhaust manifold’s support braces interacting with the film cooling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other way to keep the walls of the combustion chamber and the nozzle cool is by having additional fuel injectors along the perimeter of your injector plate. The injector plate is generally the entire top of the combustion chamber and is where the fuel and oxidizer mix, hopefully really well, and where the primary combustion occurs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I’ll do an in depth rundown on injectors here soon, but for now, just know in general they mix to a predetermined amount of fuel and oxidizer which balances performance and heat. The further away from their ideal ratio the fuel and oxidizer are, the cooler the combustion will be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10287&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_24_20_25.Still133.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Film cooling rocket engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since oxygen is a heavier molecule than most fuels and can’t be accelerated as quickly as a lighter fuel molecule can, engines tend to run fuel rich when they need to lower exhaust temps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in order to locally cool say the outer perimeter of a combustion chamber where the exhaust comes in contact with the chamber walls, you can add a few more fuel injectors so there’ll be a layer of more fuel rich exhaust that’s in contact with the walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10286&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_24_36_21.Still134.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Regenerative cooling rocket engine walls throat&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most problematic part of a rocket engine is the throat. This is where the (heat absorbed by the wall of the nozzle is the highest) temperature of the exhaust is the highest. Luckily, this high temperature exhaust is only coming in contact with a small amount of surface area, and with a finite amount of cool fuel being pumped through the walls, having only a small area in contact with the hot exhaust gas is a good thing.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;This is backwards from what we normally tend to deal with in life. If you want to cool something off, you normally want a big surface area to radiate a lot of heat away like a radiator does on a car, but that’s not what’s happening here, we have a heat source and it’s going to melt whatever it touches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think about it like if you had a red hot fire going and you have a garden hose running to try and keep stuff you put in that fire from melting. Stick a metal rod in there a little, the hose will probably do fine in keeping the rod from melting, but as you put more and more of that rod in the fire, eventually the hose will not be able to keep up with the task of keeping the rod from melting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10285&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_25_18_08.Still135.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is where a larger engine actually has a big advantage over a small engine. The volume of an engine, and therefore the amount of propellant per second in the engine, goes up by the cube of the engine’s radius, but the surface are needing cooled only goes up by the radius squared, so larger rocket engines have a lot more propellant to cool only a little more surface area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10283&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_26_22_10.Still137.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Engine throat diameters vs throat area square cube law&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s make up some numbers here, say the proportions are the same, but one engine has a throat diameter that’s 50mm and one has a throat of 100mm.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The engine with the 50mm diameter throat will have an area of 1,963 mm2 and a circumference of 157 mm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The engine with a 100mm diameter throat will have an area of 7,854 mm2 and a circumference of only 314 mm.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;In other words, the 100mm throat engine could flow 4 times more exhaust while only needing to cool twice as much surface area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But wait, it’s still twice as much to cool, right?… but guess what, if you’re flowing four times as much exhaust through the throat, it also means you’re flowing four times as much fuel as coolant through those areas as well.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So really, in a sense there’s twice as much fuel as coolant to cool a given area when you double the diameter of your throat. That’s a good thing.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So a larger engine actually gets easier and easier to cool. Of course they start to bring their own problems, such as combustion instability, but in general a bigger engine is easier to cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And right here is the biggest problem with aerospikes. By design, the throat of their combustion chamber has substantially more surface area to cool. For a toroidal aerospike, it’s combustion chamber basically has a giant plug in the middle of it which greatly increases the surface area of what needs to be cooled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s do some simple math based on those last chambers. Let’s pretend we’re trying to keep the same throat area of 7,854 square millimeters we had with that 100mm diameter throat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well in order to get that same throat area, we’d have to have say a 141mm outer diameter throat and then a 100mm inner diameter plug. This means we now more than doubled the amount of surface area we need to cool.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;We went from having a circumference of 314mm to a circumference of both 314mm plus an additional 444mm for the outer diameter for a total of 758mm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10282&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_27_49_21.Still138.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aerospike throat area&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These numbers are a bit arbitrary here because we really could stretch this any way, but one thing you can’t overcome is the fact that you’re inherently at LEAST doubling the surface area at the exact place where it’s the hardest to keep cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But truth be told, engineers don’t often suspend a plug in the middle of a normal combustion chamber, it’s more common to make a ring for a combustion chamber, but even so, a ring still has an inner diameter and an outer diameter that you now have to cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10281&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_28_06_26.Still139.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Suspended plug aerospike&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The J-2T was actually a perfect example of this. It took the turbomachinery from the J-2 engine and was put inside a toroidal spike. But just look at this picture of the J-2 vs the J-2T. You can tell just how much substantially bigger the throat is and now we have TWO throats of that larger diameter just to make up the same throat area as the standard J-2.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The math works out to being almost &lt;strong&gt;15 times harder to cool the J-2T than it is to cool a standard J-2.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s certainly not trivial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10280&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_28_32_29.Still140.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;J-2 vs J-2T toroidal aerospike engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And you have to remove that heat somehow, if regenerative cooling through the walls isn’t enough, you have to add more film cooling, change your overall burn ratio to cool all of the combustion or maybe use heavier or more expensive metals with higher melting points, any and ALL of these come at the expense of performance.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Although we’re still doing research on the combustion dynamics of aerospike engines, so far they seem to be a few percent less efficient at reacting the propellant in the combustion chambers, wasting some highly cherishable chemical energy in the propellant.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;It’s possible this could be fixed with more work, but it could just be due to some of the many compromises required to make aerospikes actually function, period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So really, the other thing that is a limiting factor for aerospikes is weight. In general, it seems like aerospikes have a much harder time achieving a high thrust to weight ratio when compared to their bell nozzle counterparts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is mostly due to the larger amount of surface area for the combustion chamber or chambers, the additional plumbing to feed all the chambers, and the additional support and structures between the spike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10329&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_00_15_20.Still090.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Multiple chambers xrs-2200 aerospike engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take a look at the XRS-2200 and look at how much stuff there is between the ramps. Although it seems like there’d be less nozzle, which may be true, there’s honestly more of literally about everything else. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And imagine if you have a leak in one of these tubes, pipes or valves. There’s a substantial more amount of points of failure on an engine like this. Or say you have a hydrogen leak, which is common because hydrogen is so hard to contain, imagine trying to track down the source of the leak in an engine like this… yeah, that’s a lot of additional hardware. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But weight is extremely important with rockets and the thrust to weight ratio is a very important metric in rocket engines. After all, extra weight directly affects your payload capacity and overall performance of the rocket, so lightweight and powerful engines is always a good metric.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10276&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_31_19_29.Still144.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Linear aerospike rocketdyne&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another thing that can be difficult to do with aerospikes is how to gimbal or steer them. Because of the large attachment points to the vehicle, it can be impractical to try and move the entire spike with thrust vector control. Although, one good thing is a gimbaled spike will never exceed its own perimeter, unlike a nozzle which can run into nearby engines.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;A common solution for thrust vectoring is to throttle individual chambers to perform differential thrust, by off-putting the thrust, it will induce pitch or yaw to the vehicle. Although it’s not as effective as steering the entire engine, it is a viable option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The RS-2200 linear aerospike was to use both actuated thrust vectoring and throttling. On the pitch and roll axis it had actuated control and for yaw control it’d throttle individual chambers all the way down to 18%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the last big deal with aerospikes is actually the lack of REAL flight data. Now although this seems like a simple solution, or a perfect submission for the “Why Don’t They Just” segment on “Our Ludicrous Future Podcast” that I’m the cohost of… I mean, “ why don’t they just FLY an aerospike…” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;– which by the way if you don’t listen to Our Ludicrous Future podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvUf_yOU_swE6PtOuv2yBqg&quot;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourludicrousfuture.com/&quot;&gt;your favorite podcast player&lt;/a&gt;, definitely get on that if you want your weekly fill of space news, EVs and futurism. Shameless plug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The thing that hasn’t really been proven out is what happens with aerospikes between supersonic speeds or above mach one, up to hypersonic speeds of mach 5. This is a non-trivial thing.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But one really really cool experiment was the LASRE experiment which was taking a scale mockup of the X-33 tail and aerospike engine, putting it on an SR-71, and flying above supersonic speeds.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;There were actually seven research flights with the LASRE experiment on an SR-71 and although they never actually fired the engine, they did perform cold firing tests at Mach 1.58 and ground firings which gave them all the information necessary to move on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10275&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_32_18_16.Still145.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LASRE experiment SR-71&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now I don’t care what you say, but a freaking aerospike engine on an SR-71 is honestly about the coolest thing ever. But regardless of how cool it looks, the aerospike engine still lacks any real runtime data in these supersonic and hypersonic regimes or almost any real full scale flight data period…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok, I think it’s time we actually put up some aerospikes against more traditional engines and see how they compare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10274&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_40_47_15.Still146.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;J-2 J-2T J-2T 250K vs xrs-2200 rs-2200 RS-25 raptor engine thrust output isp specific impulse vs comparison aerospike vs bell&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s start off with our line up of traditional bell engines. For this we’re going to look at original J-2, the J-2s that was intended to replace the J-2 engine, then we’ll look at the Space Shuttle main Engine, the RS-25 as well as SpaceX’s Raptor Engine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reason I chose these engines is because they’re substantial engines that have a lot of data, they’re either alternatives to the aerospike, the basis of aerospikes, and / or considered the best engines ever made. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This way we get a variety of engines to compare different aerospikes to. And each of these engines performs in the vacuum of space or in the case of the RS-25 and the Raptor engine, they operate in space and at sea level like an aerospike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For aerospike engines, we only have three engines that really made it through a legitimate certification and testing program, but only two that I have good hard numbers on and one that would’ve perhaps been the king of aerospikes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the engines with the most data are the J-2T-250K toroidal aerospike and the XRS-2200. By comparing these engines to the J-2S which it was based off of, we should get a good idea of its performance.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The other aerospike we’re going to look at is the RS-2200, which was the full scale engine that would’ve actually powered the Venturestar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now all of THESE numbers will have a big asterisk next to them because this engine never actually hit the stand and it relied on a lot of new and unproven-ish technologies to get these numbers, such as a lightweight carbon ramp and ceramic tubes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the numbers quoted here are what they would’ve needed to reach in order to make the Venturestar work, and truth be told, getting an engine to hit your targets can be very very difficult. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And I think it’s fun to compare all of these to the Raptor engine since we asked the question is it the king of rocket engines in that video. But the numbers on Raptor are just the current numbers and just like the Merlin engine, we do expect to see SpaceX continue to push this engine and develop it beyond these numbers in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I should also point out that these engines are drawn to scale of each other!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s start off with each engine’s fuel. Every engine here runs on liquid Hydrogen and liquid oxygen otherwise known as hydrolox except the Raptor engine which runs on liquid methane and liquid oxygen, or methalox.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I wanted most of the engines to be hydrolox so we’re comparing the most apples to apples engines since hydrolox engines have the most potential for a high specific impulse. But it’s still fun to compare them to the methalox Raptor here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next let’s look at their cycles. Again, if you need a rundown on cycles, I go into most of these in my video about the Raptor engine and its Full Flow Staged combustion cycle. But the one cycle type that I didn’t talk about is the tap-off method which actually uses the primary combustion chamber to power the turbine.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The engine here that uses the tap-off method is the J-2S which was intended to help simplify the engine and bring the cost down since it eliminated the preburner or gas generator.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The original J-2, the J-2T-250K, the XRS-2200, and the RS-2200 all use a gas generator. The RS-25 is closed cycle, fuel rich, and the Raptor engine is of course full flow staged combustion cycle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now let’s look at their thrust output. We’ll do both sea level and vacuum thrust in kilonewtons. The J-2 produced 486 kN at sea level and 1,033 kN in a vacuum, the J-2S couldn’t actually fire at sea level and in space produced 1,138 kN, the J-2T-250K produced 731 kN at sea level would do 1,112 kN in space, the XRS-2200 was 909 kN at sea level and 1,184 kN in space, the RS-2200 would’ve hopefully produced 1,917 kN at sea level and 2,201 kN in space, the RS-25 produces 1,859 kN at sea level and 2,278 kN in space and the Raptor engine produces 1,813 kN at SL and ~2,000 kN in space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now let’s look at their efficiency measured in seconds or the engine’s specific impulse. You can think of this like the fuel economy of a gas powered car. So a high specific impulse would be similar to a high mpg or kmpl. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best way to think of specific impulse is imagine you had one kg of propellant, for how many seconds can the engine push with 9.81 newtons of force? The longer it can sip on the fuel while still pushing that hard, the higher its specific impulse, and therefore the more work it can do with the same amount of fuel. IE, it’s fuel economy.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So the higher the specific impulse, the less fuel it takes to do the same amount of work, which is a good thing. A fuel efficient engine is extremely important!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The J-2 was 200 seconds at sea level and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;424s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in space, the J-2S couldn’t fire at sea level and was 436s in space, the J-2T was 290s at sea level and 441s in space ,the XRS-2200 was 339s at sea level and 436s in space, the RS-2200 was planned to have 347s at sea level and 455s in space, the RS-25 is 363s at sea level and 453s in space and the Raptor engine is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;330s at sea level and 350s in space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now as we mentioned, a huge factor in the specific impulse of an engine is the expansion ratio. So let’s see if there’s a strong correlation between expansion ratios and their specific impulse.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The J-2 was 27:1, the J-2S was 40:1, the J-2T was 80:1, the XRS-2200 – 58:1, the RS-2200 would’ve had a crazy 173:1, the RS-25 is 69:1 and the Raptor is 35:1.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;It should be noted that although the J-2s has a higher expansion ratio, it’s dimensions look almost identical to the J-2. That’s because the throat diameter is actually smaller on the J-2S compared to the J-2 in order to increase the expansion ratio but also keep the same general dimensions which would make it a drop in replacement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayastronaut.com/shop&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10336&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EA-Merch-Banner-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;everyday astronaut merch store&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;672&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And lastly, let’s look at their thrust to weight ratio. Now this one we definitely need to remind you that these numbers could be off by a bit as each company might quote the engine with varying amounts of hardware, or have different metrics for this, but in general, we can use these numbers as a decent rule of thumb.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The J-2 was 73:1, and although the J-2S was simpler with no preburner, it was a little heavier, likely due to its larger nozzle and had a 69:1 twr, the J-2T was 63:1, the XRS-2200 was 35:1, the RS-2200 was planning to hit 83:1, but would’ve needed to hit 75:1 in order to make its SSTO capabilities possible, the RS-25 is 73:1 and the Raptor is 107:1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So now that we have all of these numbers, we can really see how aerospikes compare to more traditional engines. In general, the J-2T and XRS-2200 should be compared to the J-2S since that was really what was to replace the J-2. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;When we do so, we can definitely see why both of these engines were advantageous. They offer great vacuum performance AND they can still be used at sea level, something the J-2S physically couldn’t do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in this case, the J-2T even seems to have been a better choice for an upgrade to the J-2 than the J-2s in literally every metric except thrust to weight ratio. It was a compelling option!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And now when we compare all of these to the Raptor engine, we can clearly see that the Raptor engine with a sea level nozzle and methalox isn’t as efficient in a vacuum, but with a mighty impressive thrust to weight ratio and solid sea level ISP, it’s sort of out there on its own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now had the RS-2200 actually made it through development and truly hit all these numbers, it would’ve been a very impressive engine. Not only does it have the best vacuum efficiency, it also would’ve managed to beat the RS-25’s thrust to weight ratio. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;That being said, I’ve heard from multiple sources that had Lockheed just simply stuck with the RS-25 for the Venturestar, it would’ve been just as good of an option and was already a complete engine compared to the RS-2200 which would’ve still had a full risky and costly development ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But with that in mind, I think it’s time we hear from real experts who have either worked on aerospikes or who have opted against using them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So on the note of would it be better to have used an RS-25 rather than the RS-2200, let’s hear what Tory Bruno, the CEO of ULA who actually worked on the X-33 and Venturestar program has to say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The toughest part about the design and operation of an aerospike engine is thermal management.  A traditional AS engine is conical in shape and can really struggle with heating as the spike tapers down.  The linear AS design, together with the strategy of truncating the taper, goes a long way to simplifying this problem, but it is still there.  However, this linear AS thermal advantages are accomplished in exchange for having to use many smaller engines arrayed in two lines, which adds significant complexity over a single (larger) engine conical (sometimes called “toroidal”) configuration.  The next technology issue is the management of the flow field across and around the truncated end. We usually want to flow some gas through the truncated surface to keep it organized and not be disruptive of the flow along the termination of the ramps, while also collecting a little additional thrust at higher altitudes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also asked him if he thought the RS-2200 could’ve met the metrics it was intended to hit. He said: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Mostly.  I’m sure the engine would have worked and been practical.  The complexity of so many separate engines, however, would have presented a weight growth challenge as well as significant propellant flow management complexity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And I just had to ask him if after working with aerospikes if he loved them or hated them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I love them.  Aerospikes are just plain cool, and linear aerospikes are the coolest type.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I agree Tory! I also asked Elon Musk why he hasn’t opted to use an aerospike engine for anything at SpaceX and here’s what he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIQ36Kt7UVg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So really, you can tell Elon’s biggest focus is on combustion efficiency. It seems like he’s focusing his and his engineering team’s work on combustions efficiency over the advantage of an altitude compensating nozzle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other person that I think has some cool expertise on the subject is Peter Beck, the CEO and co-founder of Rocket Lab. Not only has Peter built aerospikes himself, but he has a great view of why a company like Rocket Lab hasn’t pursued them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/undefined&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while sitting there chatting with Peter, it got me realizing that the Electron uses 9 engines, and I wondered if they could do anything like gimbaling inwards to utilize some unique aerospike like effects… here’s his response…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh there’s stuff you can do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interesting… Maybe there’s actually something to that!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But perhaps the best summary of the aerospike comes from Vector Aerospace who worked on several aerospike engines, including one of their first engines in April 2002 which was test fired in front of Elon Musk and Tom Mueller of SpaceX.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10273&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_48_30_20.Still147.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CRS-9 spacex aerospike&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The engine unfortunately only lasted 200 milliseconds before it blew the graphite plug right off the injector face. But this wasn’t their last attempt.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;They continued to pursue different aerospikes including a 10 chamber, 1,300 lbf thrust aerospike engine which also unfortunately failed on it’s 2009 flight test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2016, Vector released this statement, which I honestly think summarizes aerospikes perfectly – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While aerospike engines can provide performance advantages ,the larger number of parts and components means that they are usually heavier than their regular bell-nozzle counterparts in terms of thrust-to-weight and, more importantly, require very high component reliability.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The general consensus I’ve gotten from people who have worked on aerospikes is it’s just not worth it. Not only is the development and research costly and risky, but the net gain might not be any better than a more conventional tried and true bell engine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10272&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_49_50_22.Still148.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firefly aerospace aerospike&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this is echoed when you learn about Firefly aerospace who had a really promising aerospike engine known as the FRE-2 which was to be a 12 nozzle methane powered toroidal aerospike that was to power their Firefly Alpha. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;After a company reset, the aerospike plans died and now the company is planning to utilize a traditional bell nozzle as well… What’s going on, WHERE ARE OUR AEROSPIKES?!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So how many companies are currently working on aerospikes as we speak… so far as I can tell… one. Ish. Kind of. Well maybe two…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARCA has a pretty intriguing video series called “Flight of the Aerospike” and they are promising to make a low cost and simple SSTO aerospike rocket. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But oddly enough… the latest video in the “flight of the Aerospike” series shows the company testing their new systems using a traditional bell nozzle and simplifying their rocket to running on steam… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10271&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_50_35_07.Still149.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Arca aerospace aerospike&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now I want this company to succeed and I really want them to fire off their linear aerospike, but from what I can tell, they’ve got a VERY long way to go before they would ever fly one.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And although the company has been around for 20 years and has yet to fire an aerospike, perhaps they’ll make some progress and get anything flying someday… but I’m starting to think this too will fall in the “well, it turns out it wasn’t worth it” category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other company currently working on an aerospike is RocketStar who is pursuing an aerospike, but so far their engines seem to only be in the high powered model rocket category, although they do have plans for a Starlord rocket which would use an aerospike… but this is very much a paper rocket so far as I can tell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But aerospikes still have some promise… right? I mean, most of the concepts we looked at utilized the open cycle or gas generator engines, couldn’t there be ways to improve upon aerospikes that would make them worth it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s two pretty promising ideas / technologies that might actually help aerospikes find their place on the bottom end of an orbital rocket. The first being 3D printing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10269&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_51_50_09.Still151.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3D printing aerospike&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3D printing allows for advanced designs that can help make cooling channels and combustion chamber shapes, that would normally be physically impossible to manufacture, super easier to manufacture at the push of a button. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s companies like amaero who have built additively manufactured aerospikes out of Hasteloy X which is a high strength nickel based superalloy. It’s really cool to see how they can print these crazy shapes that are required for an aerospike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other concept, that very well might work hand in hand with 3D printing is a dual expander cycle aerospike engine and one in particular is known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a558199.pdf&quot;&gt;Dual Expander Aerospike Nozzle or DEAN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;What’s cool about DEAN is it takes the biggest problem of aerospikes, which is heat, and makes use of it in the expander cycle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10267&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_53_18_21.Still153.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DEAN expander cycle aerospike&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The expander cycle is where a rocket engine takes the liquid fuel that cools the chamber, heats it up to the point of phase change into hot gaseous fuel and then using that to spin the turbine which then will power the engine.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The problem with expander cycles is actually the opposite of aerospikes. They have a thrust output limit based on how much liquid fuel an engine can actually heat up and turn into gaseous fuel.  Due to the square – cube law, you eventually run out of surface area to heat up the fuel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The theoretical limit is approximately 300 kN of thrust before the surface area to volume of fuel ratio gets to the point where you can no longer power the pumps adequately. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But by having more surface area to heat up fuel, like an aerospike engine inherently has, you can actually get away with a more powerful engine, which might be a cool trick for future aerospike engines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But to date, the DEAN concept has only existed in theoretical papers which targets an engine with 111 kN, 383s of impulse in a vacuum and a TWR ratio of 108, which I should note, these specific impulse and TWR numbers would put it on par with the Raptor engine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But again, research papers and actual working hardware are very very different things, which is why many of these concepts are studied only in research labs and often don’t make it much further nor do they end up being commercially viable, for now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok wow. This ended up being a LOT longer article than I would’ve ever imagined. So let’s do a quick summary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aerospikes. Super cool on paper, a super tantalizing concept that seems to beckon even the most astute rocket engineers, perfect for your SSTO concept that also might need to be reconsidered, AND likely to drain your bank account and make you age a few decades trying to develop it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;BUT… BUT… they are super cool and as manufacturing and material sciences advance, perhaps we’ll see companies able to utilize and exploit their advantages and close the gap on the bell nozzle which has dominated the aerospace industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps the biggest reason we generally don’t see too many aerospikes popping up in modern times is simple… If they truly offered a clear performance advantage, I would assume everyone would be developing them, but the fact of the matter is, they kind of wind up right back in the same place as a normal rocket engine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now you could probably say the exact same thing about SpaceX’s Raptor engine which utilizes a full flow staged combustion cycle… that was considered far too difficult to really be worth it previously. And that rocket engine is EXTREMELY complex and unbelievably hard AND expensive to develop.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;BUT, the thing is, the full flow staged combustion cycle will actually perform better in virtually all metrics than other rocket engines, period. Where as the aerospike might gain some advantages in say altitude compensation, but it lacks advantages in other areas which puts it right back on par with other engines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So as far as where to spend your time and research, that’s why most engineers have pursued things like closed cycle engines, full flow staged combustion cycle, or the path of easiest manufacturing and development like Rocket Lab’s electric pump fed engines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And one last fun note about aerospikes, and this is sort of similar to how my SSTO video ended… it’s not really the aerospikes that suck, but their application here on Earth is probably the wrong planet to utilize them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ironically, if Earth’s atmosphere was ANY thicker, they would actually become significantly more advantageous, even for a multistage rocket, but with Earth’s atmosphere as it is, the bell nozzle is just too close to the same performance, making it a much easier and less risky choice in the aerospace industry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If it wasn’t for their thermally backwards nature, their advantages may actually outweigh their disadvantages, but perhaps their tendency to melt is the biggest reason why we just simply haven’t really seen one leave Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But all in all, I think the best way I can summarize the Aerospike is to compare it to like the rotary engine seen on cars like the Mazda RX-7 and RX-8 and their predecessors. For those of you familiar with car engines, you may know about rotary engines. They’re super simple, only 3 moving parts, small, lightweight and powerful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;On paper it really should’ve been a more popular choice in the automotive world, but in practice, they’re a nightmare to cool and lubricate and have awful fuel economy and poor lifespan and reliability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-10265&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Aerospike-Timeline.00_57_07_01.Still155.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rotary engine&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That being said, they’ve maintained a major cult following and in some aspects, they still are a good choice. People have always argued if there was as much engineering put into the rotary engine as there has been for the piston engine, maybe the rotary would be as efficient and reliable as a piston engine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And in the same way, sure, maybe the aerospike could improve and be a more viable choice with an increase in research and development. But much like the rotary engine, would it really be worth it? Would it really ever really be better than the alternatives?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;You’ll hear me say this all the time, rocket science and engineering is just an insanely complex series of compromises.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The art of rocket engineering is balancing alllll of your variables, not only in performance but in reliability, cost, development risk, manufacturing and tying them all together to make the right choice for your vehicle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of the day, an aerospikes biggest advantage is being able to fire a vacuum optimized engine at sea level, but in all reality, why do you WANT to do that?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Unless you are for whatever reason required to do an SSTO, you really never would need to do this because it’s much more common to just fire a sea level engine on your first stage and a vacuum optimized engine on your upper stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what do you think? Do you think aerospikes are too cool to ignore? Think we’ll ever see one propel a vehicle into orbit or do you think the bell nozzle is just the right choice? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And be sure and let me know what other questions you have about aerospike engines, rocket engines, or rocket science in general and stick around because I have a perpetually growing list of awesome articles I’m trying to crank out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Are Aerospike Engines Better Than Traditional Rocket Engines?</og:title>
<og:url>https://everydayastronaut.com/aerospikes/</og:url>
<og:description>Today we’re going to look at the history of aerospike engines, go over how nozzles work including things like overexpansion, underexpansion and even expansion ratios, we’ll look at the pros and cons of the aerospike, the physical limitations and problems, then we’ll compare the aerospike to some other traditional rocket engines.  But that’s not all, I obtained never seen before photos and videos of some aerospikes, we’ll get opinions from some people who have actually worked with aerospike engines, look at some promising prospects and compelling concepts and by the end of the video we’ll hopefully know whether or not the holy grail of rocket engines is just waiting to be utilized or if aerospikes just simply aren’t worth it.</og:description>

<title>New pathfinding algorithm</title>
<link>https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-317</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-317</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;8.3333333333333&quot;&gt;Posted by Oxyd, TOGoS, Klonan on 2019-10-18, &lt;a href=&quot;https://factorio.com/blog/&quot;&gt;all posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New pathfinding algorithm &lt;span&gt;Oxyd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week we mentioned the change to make biters not collide with each other, but that wasn’t the only biter-related update we released this past week. Somewhat coincidentally, this week’s updates have included something I’d been working on for a few weeks before – an upgrade to the enemy pathfinding system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pathfinding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a unit wants to go somewhere, it first needs to figure out how to get there. That could be as simple as going straight to its goal, but there can be obstacles – such as cliffs, trees, spawners, player entities – in the way. To do that, it will tell the &lt;em&gt;pathfinder&lt;/em&gt; its current position and the goal position, and the pathfinder will – possibly after many ticks – reply with a &lt;em&gt;path&lt;/em&gt;, which is simply a series of waypoints for the unit to follow in order to get to its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do its job, the pathfinder uses an algorithm called A* (pronounced 'A star'). A simple example of A* pathfinding is shown in the video below: A biter wants to go around some cliffs. The pathfinder starts exploring the map around the biter (shown as white dots). First it tries to go straight toward the goal, but as soon as it reaches the cliffs, it 'spills' both ways, trying to find a position from which it can again go toward the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webm/Mp4 playback not supported on your device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this video, the algorithm is slowed down to better show how it works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each dot in the animation represents a &lt;em&gt;node&lt;/em&gt;. Each node remembers its distance from the start of the search, and an estimate of the distance from that node toward the goal – this estimate is provided by what's called a &lt;em&gt;heuristic function&lt;/em&gt;. Heuristic functions are what make A* work – it's what steers the algorithm in the correct direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple choice for this function is simply the straight-line distance from the node to the goal position – this is what we have been using in Factorio since forever, and it’s what makes the algorithm initially go straight. It’s not the only choice, however – if the heuristic function knew about some of the obstacles, it could steer the algorithm around them, which would result in a faster search, since it wouldn’t have to explore extra nodes. Obviously, the smarter the heuristic, the more difficult it is to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple straight-line heuristic function is fine for pathfinding over relatively short distances. This was okay in past versions of Factorio – about the only long distance pathfinding was done by biters made angry by pollution, and that doesn’t happen very often, relatively speaking. These days, however, we have artillery. Artillery can easily shoot – and aggro – massive numbers of biters on the far end of a large lake, who will then all try to pathfind around the lake. The video below shows what it looks like when the simple A* algorithm we've been using until now tries to go around a lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webm/Mp4 playback not supported on your device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This video shows how fast the algorithm works in reality; it hasn’t been slowed down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Contracting Chunks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathfinding is an old problem, and so there are many techniques for improving pathfinding. Some of these techniques fall into the category of &lt;em&gt;hierarchical pathfinding&lt;/em&gt; – where the map is first simplified, a path is found in the simplified map, and this is then used to help find the real path. Again, there are several techniques for how exactly to do this, but all of them require a simplification of the search space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we simplify a Factorio world? Our maps are randomly generated, and also constantly changing – placing and removing entities (such as assemblers, walls or turrets) is probably the most core mechanic of the entire game. We don’t want to recalculate the simplification each time an entity is added or removed. At the same time, resimplifying the map from scratch every time we want to find a path could quite easily negate any performance gains made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one of our source access people, Allaizn, who came up with the idea that I ended up implementing. In retrospect, the idea is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is based around 32x32 chunks of tiles. The simplification process will replace each chunk with one or more &lt;em&gt;abstract nodes&lt;/em&gt;. Since our goal is to improve pathfinding around lakes, we can ignore all entities and consider the tiles only – water is impassable, land is passable. We split each chunk into separate &lt;em&gt;components&lt;/em&gt; – a component is an area of tiles where a unit can go from any tile within the component to any other within the same component. The image below shows a chunk split into two distinct components, red and green. Each of these components will become a single abstract node – basically, the entire chunk is reduced into two 'points'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;896&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-317-components.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allaizn’s key insight was that we don’t need to store the component for every tile on the map – it is enough to remember the components for the tiles on the perimeter of each chunk. This is because what we really care about is what other components (in neighbouring chunks) each component is connected to – that can only depend on the tiles that are on the very edge of the chunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hierarchical Pathfinding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have figured out how to simplify the map, so how do we use that for finding paths? As I said earlier, there are multiple techniques for hierarchical pathfinding. The most straightforward idea would be to simply find a path using abstract nodes from start to goal – that is, the path would be a list of chunk components that we have to visit – and then use a series plain old A* searches to figure out how exactly to go from one chunk's component to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that we simplified the map a bit too much: What if it isn’t possible to go from one chunk to another because of some entities (such as cliffs) blocking the path? When contracting chunks we ignore all entities, so we merely know that the tiles between the chunks are somehow connected, but know nothing about whether it actually is possible to go from one to the other or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to use the simplification merely as a 'suggestion' for the real search. Specifically, we will use it to provide a smart version of the heuristic function for the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what we end up with is this: We have two pathfinders, called the &lt;em&gt;base pathfinder&lt;/em&gt;, which finds the actual path, and the &lt;em&gt;abstract pathfinder&lt;/em&gt;, which provides the heuristic function for the base pathfinder. Whenever the base pathfinder creates a new base node, it calls the abstract pathfinder to get the estimate on the distance to the goal. The abstract pathfinder works backwards – it starts at the goal of the search, and works its way toward the start, jumping from one chunk’s component to another. Once the abstract search finds the chunk and the component in which the new base node is created, it uses the distance from the start of the abstract search (which, again, is the goal position of the overall search) to calculate the estimated distance from the new base node to the overall goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running an entire pathfinder for every single base node would, however, be anything but fast, even if the abstract pathfinder leaps from one chunk to the next. Instead we use what’s called Reverse Resumable A*. Reverse means simply it goes from goal to start, as I already said. Resumable means that after it finds the chunk the base pathfinder is interested in, we keep all its nodes in memory. The next time the base pathfinder creates a new node and needs to know its distance estimate, we simply look at the abstract nodes we kept from the previous search, with a good chance the required abstract node will still be there (after all, one abstract node covers a large part of a chunk, often the entire chunk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the base pathfinder creates a node that is in a chunk not covered by any abstract node, we don’t need to do an entire abstract search all over again. A nice property of the A* algorithm is that even after it 'finishes' and finds a path, it can keep going, exploring nodes around the nodes it already explored. And that's exactly what we do if we need a distance estimate for a base node located in a chunk not yet covered by the abstract search: We resume the abstract search from the nodes we kept in memory, until it expands to the node that we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video below shows the new pathfinding system in action. Blue circles are the abstract nodes; white dots are the base search. The pathfinder was slowed down significantly to make this video, to show how it works. At normal speed, the entire search takes only a few ticks. Notice how the base search, which is still using the same old algorithm we've always used, just 'knows' where to go around the lake, as if by magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webm/Mp4 playback not supported on your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the abstract pathfinder is only used to provide the heuristic distance estimates, the base search can quite easily digress from the path suggested by the abstract search. This means that even though our chunk contraction scheme ignores all entities, the base pathfinder can still go around them with little trouble. Ignoring entities in the map simplification process means we don't have to redo it every time an entity is placed or removed, and only need to cover tiles being changed (such as with landfill) – which happens way less often than entity placements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that we are still essentially using the same old pathfinder we've been using for years now, only with an upgraded heuristic function. That means this change shouldn’t affect too many things, other than the speed of the search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bye bye TOGoS &lt;span&gt;TOGoS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody!&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to be resigning from official Factorio staff after today to start a new job closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for this switch is that working entirely remotely turned out to be something that I wasn't able to handle all that well. But also, my primary contribution to the project, the programmable map generator, is complete, stable, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.factorio.com/74615#p451620&quot;&gt;pretty well understood by at least one other person&lt;/a&gt;, so timing-wise this seemed a good point for me to move on. To working in a cube farm writing Android applications for treadmills, apparently.&lt;br /&gt;We'll see how that goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been an honor to be part of this awesome project and to leave my imprint on it. And working on a large and pretty well-managed C++ codebase, full of things done just a bit different than I had ever thought to, has been mind-opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the community for your continual patience, honest feedback, and the occasional bit of pressure that you put on us to make the game as good as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll continue to read the Friday Facts every week, lurk on the forums, and probably update documentation here and there. Hopefully I'll find time to crank out some terrain-altering mods of my own. And I'm looking forward to seeing what else y'all do with it, too. (Which includes working through a backlog of mods -- I have yet to get to the space exploration part of Space Exploration!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace out for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Community spotlight - 13x9 Micro Factory &lt;span&gt;Klonan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 100 Friday Facts ago we covered DaveMcW's 9x14 Micro Factory (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-197&quot;&gt;FFF-197&lt;/a&gt;). While it may have taken over 2 years, he has improved his design even further, and the result is just as impressive as before.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Last week we mentioned the change to make biters not collide with each other, but that wasn’t the only biter-related update we released this past week. Somewhat coincidentally, this week’s updates have included something I’d been working on for a few weeks before – an upgrade to the enemy pathfinding system. Pathfinding When a unit wants to go somewhere, it first needs to figure out how to get there. That could be as simple as going straight to its goal, but there can be obstacles – such as cliffs, trees, spawners, player entities – in the way. To do that, it will tell the pathfinder its current position and the goal position, and the pathfinder will – possibly after many ticks – reply with a path, which is simply a series of...</og:description>

<title>Earth and Sun</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this article I’ll try to explain how the Sun and the various motions of the Earth end up making our planet look like in the demonstration below. You can drag the globe around to see it from different perspectives and use the sliders to change the date and time:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to talk about Earth and Sun without referencing a few dimensions and dates. They’ll be shown in &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;imperial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;metric&lt;/span&gt; units (e.g. &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;1 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;1 km&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;an American&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;an international&lt;/span&gt; date format (&lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;mm/dd/yyyy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;dd/mm/yyyy&lt;/span&gt;), but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;switch_units();return false;&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;the more universal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;American&lt;/span&gt; units if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time of day will be presented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time&quot;&gt;Coordinated Universal Time&lt;/a&gt;, or UTC for short, which is roughly a local time in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich&quot;&gt;Greenwich&lt;/a&gt; in London, UK. This time standard is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; adjusted for daylight saving time which is very convenient as it will let us look at the sunlight for the same time of day at different dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by visualizing how enormous the Sun is. In the picture below you’ll find the Earth and the Sun placed next to each other. The Earth is the tiny blue dot on the right side of the Sun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun is almost a perfect sphere with a radius of &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;432,170 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;695,700 km&lt;/span&gt;. The Earth’s shape resembles an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid&quot;&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/a&gt; with an average radius of &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;3958.8 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;6371 km&lt;/span&gt;. As such, the radius of the Sun is 109 times larger than that of the Earth. Naturally, the Sun doesn’t look that large in the sky, but that’s because the Sun is quite far away from the Earth. Before we see how far away the Sun is we first have to discuss a simple shape that is the base of all planetary orbits – an ellipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to define an ellipse, but in the context of space it’s most convenient to speak of it in terms of &lt;em&gt;focal points&lt;/em&gt;. An ellipse is a figure consisting of points for which the sum of distances to its two focal points is constant. That’s certainly a mouthful, so an interactive diagram will paint a better picture:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The small cross represents the center of an ellipse while the two white disks show its focal points. The total length of blue and red segments is the same for every point on the ellipse. The &lt;span class=&quot;es_dashed&quot;&gt;dashed&lt;/span&gt; line is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse while the &lt;span class=&quot;es_dotted&quot;&gt;dotted&lt;/span&gt; line is the semi-minor axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defining property of an ellipse is the ratio between a distance &lt;span class=&quot;es_c0&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; from the center to a focal point known as &lt;em&gt;linear eccentricity&lt;/em&gt;, and a distance &lt;span class=&quot;es_c1&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; from the center to the “far point” of the ellipse i.e. the length of its semi-major axis. In the demonstration below you can adjust that ratio with a slider:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This ratio is known as &lt;em&gt;eccentricity&lt;/em&gt;. When an eccentricity is equal to 0 an ellipse becomes a perfect circle, for eccentricity of 1 an ellipse with a fixed major axis length degenerates into a linear segment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have already heard that the orbit of the Earth is an ellipse and that the Sun is located in one of the focal points of that ellipse. This situation is often visualized like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The small cross in the middle shows the center of the ellipse while the small rings, one of which is directly in the center of the Sun, symbolize the focal points. There are two important points on the orbit: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_perihelion();return false;&quot;&gt;perihelion&lt;/a&gt; is the point at which Earth is closest to the Sun, while at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_aphelion();return false;&quot;&gt;aphelion&lt;/a&gt; Earth is the furthest away from the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Sun is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in one of the focal points of the ellipse, but instead the objects in the Solar System revolve around its &lt;a href=&quot;https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/barycenter/en/&quot;&gt;center of mass&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Sun’s mass is so dominant that the actual focal point is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter#/media/File:Solar_system_barycenter.svg&quot;&gt;fairly close&lt;/a&gt; to the Sun’s center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’ve seen above paints a convenient picture, but the actual relative sizes are very different. Below you’ll find a visualization of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun with proper scales. The tiny yellow dot in the middle depicts the Sun. At your current viewing scale the Earth is pretty much invisible, it has a diameter of &lt;span id=&quot;es_earth_diameter_pixels&quot;/&gt; pixels, so instead its location is shown by an arrow. You may also be barely able to tell that the orbit is elliptical. Its eccentricity is equal to 0.0167 and the Sun is very close to the center:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you pay a close attention to the position of the Earth at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;year_orbit_begin();return false;&quot;&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt; of a calendar year and compare it with the beginning of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;year_orbit_end();return false;&quot;&gt;next year&lt;/a&gt; you’ll notice that the Earth hasn’t returned to the exact same position – during 365 days the Earth falls a little short of the full orbit. We’ll soon see that there are multiple ways to define “a day”, but unless stated otherwise we’ll assume that it lasts 24 hours, that is 24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time it takes Earth to get back to the same point on the orbit is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year&quot;&gt;sidereal year&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;em&gt;sidereal&lt;/em&gt; means “with respect to stars”. A sidereal year lasts roughly 365.256 days. A sidereal year is actually &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the basis of year tracking in civilian time, but we’ll have to wait until the later parts of this article to discuss &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; period of Earth’s journey around the Sun that defines how we count years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit is fairly small so the distance between the center of the Sun at aphelion (&lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;94,509,460 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;152,098,233 km&lt;/span&gt;) is not that much larger than that at perihelion (&lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;91,402,640 mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;147,098,291 km&lt;/span&gt;). As such, the apparent Sun size is only 3.3% smaller when the Sun is the farthest from Earth compared to when it’s closest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the enormous size differences we’re dealing with from this point on I’ll abandon the exact relative dimensions and instead use whatever size is convenient to demonstrate the discussed subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of planetary motion are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion&quot;&gt;Kepler’s laws&lt;/a&gt; of which the second one describes the planet’s speed at different points on the orbit. In the demonstration below you can make the planet orbit the Sun. As Kepler has discovered, traversal of each of the arc of the pie-slice sections of the orbit takes &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; amount of time:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the bottom part of the simulation you can see the flattened length of the arc the planet sweeps within the same amount of time. When the planet is closer to the Sun it travels a much longer path, that is it moves much &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; than when it’s away from the Sun. Kepler’s second law says that the &lt;em&gt;areas&lt;/em&gt; of the triangular pieces are the same, so naturally if the height of the triangle is made longer due to a larger distance to the Sun, the base, i.e. the arc swept, has to get shorter to maintain the same area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the actual shape of Earth’s orbit the arc length differences are much smaller, but as we’ll discuss, they still impact some aspects of time tracking on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve been looking at the orbit from above, but a tilted perspective shows that the orbit defines an infinite flat sheet known as the orbital plane. You may drag over the demonstration up and down to change the viewing angle:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In fact, all planets in the Solar System have very similar orbital planes which is a consequence of formation of the planets from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk&quot;&gt;protoplanetary disk&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth pointing out that the plane represents a &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; – Earth wobbles slightly up and down due to changes in position of the Moon, and, to a smaller extent, of other planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we’re still not ready to discuss how a year is measured, but understanding the Earth’s revolution around the Sun will actually help us describe the duration of a day, so let’s discuss the most tangible motion of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Earth rotates around its axis from west to east, or, when seen from above, counter-clockwise. In the simulation below you can change the time of day by dragging the slider. The first important thing to observe is that the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane shown as a horizontal line. Currently the axis is tilted at roughly 23.437° away from the vertical:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you compare the position of the Earth &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;earth_rot_begin();return false;&quot;&gt;at the beginning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;earth_rot_end();return false;&quot;&gt;at the end&lt;/a&gt; of a 24 hour cycle you may notice something surprising – the Earth has completed slightly more than one full rotation around its axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a full 360° rotation takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and little over 4 seconds, a period known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time&quot;&gt;sidereal day&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that while the Earth is rotating around its axis, it’s also traveling along its orbit. In the demonstration below, which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much not to scale, you can see how after one full rotation the point on the Earth that was pointing at the Sun no longer does so and it requires some more time for that location to face the Sun again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Out of all the stars in the sky the Sun is the one of paramount importance to our lives so the base measure of a day is the period after which the same point on Earth points at Sun again. To be more precise, we’re interested in the duration after which the Sun comes around to be directly above the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)&quot;&gt;meridian&lt;/a&gt; – a half a circle on the surface of the Earth connecting the poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also brings us to the concept of solar &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon&quot;&gt;noon&lt;/a&gt;, a time of day at which the Sun is located directly over some point at the local meridian. In the demonstration below that meridian is shown with a yellow color while the red dot shows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsolar_point&quot;&gt;subsolar point&lt;/a&gt; – a location on Earth that points directly towards the Sun:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Depending on one’s position on the Earth, during a local solar noon the subsolar point is either directly north, directly south, or directly at the current location. This is also where the terms AM and PM come from. In Latin &lt;em&gt;ante meridiem&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;before midday&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;post meridiem&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;after midday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noon is the time of day at which the Sun is at the highest point in the sky which also means that the shadows cast by the sunlight are the shortest. Naturally, we don’t set our clocks to solar time. Instead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone&quot;&gt;time zones&lt;/a&gt; are used to provide a more uniform timing within different regions of the world. Despite heavily &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#/media/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png&quot;&gt;irregular shapes&lt;/a&gt; the centers of the time zones correspond to roughly noon of local solar time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duration between two solar noons is known as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time&quot;&gt;solar day&lt;/a&gt; which lasts the familiar 24 hours. However, that’s not completely accurate. If you look closely at the simulation of the sidereal and solar day you’ll notice that we didn’t account for two important factors – eccentricity of the orbit and the axial tilt of the Earth. In fact, 24 hours is the duration of a &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; solar day. The actual duration of each individual day varies, but before we witness that variation we have to discuss the most important consequence of the axial tilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to look at the orbital plane from above you’d notice that the axial tilt of the Earth isn’t aligned to either the major or the minor axis of the orbit’s ellipse. In the simulation below you can observe the position of the Earth and its axis of rotation at different points of the year:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The four colored line segments mark four important points on that path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;during &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_spring&quot;&gt;March equinox&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_fall&quot;&gt;September equinox&lt;/span&gt; in the top-down view the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the direction towards the Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;during &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_summer&quot;&gt;June solstice&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;nobreak es_winter&quot;&gt;December solstice&lt;/span&gt; in the top-down view the axis of rotation is parallel to the direction towards the Sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, at different times of year either the Northern or the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun which is clearly visible when we look at the orbital plane from a side with the point of September equinox pointing &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; at us:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The change in tilt relative to the Sun causes the familiar cycle of seasons. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_june_solstice();return false;&quot;&gt;June solstice&lt;/a&gt; marks the time at which the Northern Hemisphere is maximally exposed to the Sun and the summer begins, however, at the same time the Southern Hemisphere is facing away from the Sun and in that part of the world the winter begins. The situation flips during &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_december_solstice();return false;&quot;&gt;December solstice&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_equinox();return false;&quot;&gt;equinoxes&lt;/a&gt; both hemispheres are equally exposed, the day and night last roughly 12 hours which gives the event its name – in Latin &lt;em&gt;aequus nox&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;equal night&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the seasons in practice, let’s look at the Earth from the Sun’s perspective. The horizontal line shows the orbital plane:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice, that during &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_summer();return false;&quot;&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; on the Northern Hemisphere no matter what time of day it is the Sun never “sees” Antarctica – the Sun never rises there. Conversely, during &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciechanow.ski/earth-and-sun/#&quot; class=&quot;es_link_button&quot; onclick=&quot;show_winter();return false;&quot;&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt; on the Northern Hemisphere the Sun always sees that continent and so the Sun doesn’t set during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being directly exposed to sunlight is only a part of the seasonal picture. Despite constant exposure to Sun during summer on the Southern Hemisphere Antarctica is still a very cold place. It’s the direction at which the sunrays hit the ground that determines the amount of power the surface is exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the demonstration below I marked three bands on the surface of the Earth – each one occupies 36° of latitude. The thin lines symbolize sunrays hitting the Earth. By changing the date you can observe how the percentage of all the rays approaching the planet is distributed among those bands:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The more perpendicular to the rays the surface is, the more energy it receives – the factor scales with a cosine of the angle between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)&quot;&gt;surface normal&lt;/a&gt; and the direction of the incoming light. During summer months the Northern Hemisphere receives a much higher percentage of incoming rays compared to winter months which explains the average temperature difference between the two seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s also interesting to see the sunlight from a reference frame fixed onto Earth. You can drag around to spin the globe freely in space. Yet again the red dot shows a location of the subsolar point:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What may be a little surprising is that at a &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; time of day the point on Earth that points directly towards the Sun is quite wobbly when the date changes – it not only moves in north-south direction, but also in east-west direction. This effect is visible more clearly on a world map with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection&quot;&gt;equirectangular projection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When seen from Earth this figure 8 shape is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma&quot;&gt;analemma&lt;/a&gt;. In the following demonstration you can see the position of the Sun in the sky as seen at &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;12:00 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;12:00&lt;/span&gt; UTC from the Greenwich area in London. I chose this location since its mean solar time is pretty much the same as UTC time. The vertical lines represent angle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth&quot;&gt;azimuth&lt;/a&gt;. The one corresponding to 180° is located directly &lt;em&gt;south&lt;/em&gt; of the observer. The horizontal lines show angles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system&quot;&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; – the angle above the horizon. In the bottom right corner you can see which part of the sky is the observer located at the black dot looking at:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Sun may seem tiny, but its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter&quot;&gt;angular diameter&lt;/a&gt; is only 0.53°, while the entire analemma spans 2 × 23.437° = 46.874° in the vertical direction. The Sun isn’t always at its highest point in the sky at &lt;span class=&quot;imperial_word&quot;&gt;12:00 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;metric_word&quot;&gt;12:00&lt;/span&gt; local mean solar time, sometimes it’s a bit ahead of time and sometimes it’s late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the actual &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Apparent_solar_time&quot;&gt;apparent solar time&lt;/a&gt; and the “expected” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time#Mean_solar_time&quot;&gt;mean solar time&lt;/a&gt; is described by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time&quot;&gt;equation of time&lt;/a&gt;. The two primary causes for the drift is eccentricity of the orbit, which by Kepler’s second law causes variation in the Earth’s orbital speed, and the axial tilt which causes difference of speed of the subsolar point in “around the Earth” direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small daily differences accumulate to fairly big numbers – the Sun can be late by up to 14 minutes and ahead of schedule by up to 16 minutes against it’s clock-expected position. However, across the entire year the duration of a day averages out to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally have a grasp of how “a day” is measured and how important the Sun is in that picture. Moreover, the position of Sun relative to the Earth also plays a critical role for defining a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you recall our discussion of the axial tilt you may have assumed that while the direction of the axial tilt isn’t aligned to either major or minor axis of the orbital ellipse it is otherwise static. However, this is not actually the case. The axis itself slowly rotates, when seen from above, in a clockwise direction. In the demonstration below you can see how the direction changes over time. A top down view of the orbit is placed in the bottom right corner:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This effect is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession&quot;&gt;axial precession&lt;/a&gt; and is caused by gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon. It takes about 25,772 years for the revolution to complete. Over time the precession will cause &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris&quot;&gt;Polaris&lt;/a&gt; to no longer be the north star as the Earth’s axis will point at some other direction in the starry sky. In a few thousand years it will be spring instead of winter that will begin on the Northern Hemisphere around the time of perihelion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the effect is very slow it has an impact on time tracking on Earth. In the exaggerated simulation below you can see how the precession causes the point of March equinox to change. In the bottom right corner you can observe the arc that the axis traverses in this period:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thick outline of the almost complete circle shows the path of Earth between two March equinoxes. This period defines a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year&quot;&gt;tropical year&lt;/a&gt; which, because of the precession, is &lt;em&gt;shorter&lt;/em&gt; than a sidereal year – it lasts roughly 365.2422 days. Given the importance of stable occurrence of the cycle of seasons in the calendar it’s this period that is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; foundation of year tracking on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duration of a tropical year is non integral and after 4 years of 365 days we’re almost a full day away from the actual place on the orbit at which the March equinox occurs. A solution to this problem are leap years which in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar&quot;&gt;Julian calendar&lt;/a&gt; occurred every four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that this is a little too much of a correction – simply observing a leap year every four years makes a year last 365.25 days on average. Over the centuries the date undershoot was measurable in days and to resolve the situation the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar&quot;&gt;Gregorian calendar&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 1582 which, other than skipping over 10 days, added some extra caveats to the simple four-year rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years divisible by 100 are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; leap years, &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; they’re also divisible by 400 – the year 2000 was a leap year, but the year 2100 won’t be. This causes a year in the Gregorian calendar to on average last 365.2425 days which is a much closer match to the duration of a tropical year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of axial precession was a hint that many of the parameters of the Earth’s motion that may seem static are in fact anything but — everything about the positioning of the Earth changes as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The angle of the axial tilt varies between 22.1° and 24.5°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The eccentricity of the orbit varies between almost 0.0 and 0.0679 with multiple overlapping cycles of different periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elliptical orbit itself also rotates – an effect known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession&quot;&gt;apsidal precession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles&quot;&gt;cycles&lt;/a&gt; have different periods, but they all contribute to the very complex nature of the journey of the Earth through the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual a lot of great educational videos can be found on YouTube. Vsauce’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJhgZBn-LHg&quot;&gt;How Earth Moves&lt;/a&gt; covers many of the same topics I’ve discussed in a more entertaining way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82p-DYgGFjI&quot;&gt;Earth’s motion around the Sun, not as simple as I thought&lt;/a&gt; by Aryan Navabi has good visuals and goes into more details of a long term cyclical nature of Earth’s motions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a beautiful explanation of why planets have elliptical orbits I recommend 3Blue1Brown’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xdIjYBtnvZU&quot;&gt;Feynman’s Lost Lecture&lt;/a&gt;. The video is based on a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Feynmans-Lost-Lecture-David-Goodstein-ebook/dp/B002WQLN6U&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; by the same title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Strobel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astronomynotes.com/&quot;&gt;Astronomy Notes&lt;/a&gt; provide a good overview of many topics that I haven’t covered in a form of lecture notes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.astrosurf.com/luxorion/analemma.htm&quot;&gt;The Solar Analemma&lt;/a&gt; by Anthony Ayiomamitis is a five page story about difficulties of capturing analemma on a camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a traditional book form &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/celestial-calculations&quot;&gt;Celestial Calculations&lt;/a&gt; by J. L. Lawrence is a great introduction to planetary motions. The book successfully bridges the gap between pop-science overviews of the space and the math-heavy advanced reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it captivating that two seemingly separate concepts of a day and a year, driven by two different motions of Earth, are ultimately connected by the Sun and the interaction of its light with our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit#Definitions&quot;&gt;modern definition&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; describing the flow of time in terms of the position of the Sun in the sky may seem archaic, but up until the middle of 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century a second was simply defined as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;86400&lt;/sub&gt; of a mean solar day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve since let go of that dependence, but the present day measure is just a much finer and &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; more stable expression of pretty much the same duration. One day we’ll colonize other planets, those planets will have different suns, orbits, and rotations periods, yet a simple second will forever be tied to Earth and Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Coffee Is Hard</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.stilldrinking.org/blog_images/coffee/coffee-is-hard.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back in the 80s, some people had a dream of combining the cutesy graphics of 80s visual games and the soul-crushing difficulty of 80s text adventures. And so Sierra On-Line created quest games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quest games started with a premise like “escape the wizard” or “escape the aliens” then forced you to do a series of banal and random tasks to avoid the many, many ways to die. Once you know the way, most of the games can be completed in under an hour. On the first go, it took my whole family weeks. Not the least of the horror was often having to do things several scenes before there’s any reason for having done them: in &lt;em&gt;Space Quest I&lt;/em&gt;, the hero-janitor Roger has to refuse the first offer for his bike, so the guy will come back a little later and throw in a jetpack. Of course there’s no indication that he’ll come back with a jetpack, and no reason to think there’s a need for a jetpack until three days later when Roger exits his spaceship and floats into the void because he doesn’t have a jetpack. This leads to replaying most of the game a dozen times just looking for a jetpack, which is hidden not in a spaceship closet or a bar or a cavern, but behind a tough-but-not-too-tough bargaining strategy. It also took about ninety seconds to switch between screens, so exploration was grueling on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most treasured memories are agonies that won’t get out of the mind and have to get turned into a character-building story to maintain sanity, so I searched hard for a modern port of these games and immediately inflicted them on my girlfriend. We got through the first two &lt;em&gt;Space Quests&lt;/em&gt; in a few hours since I remembered about three quarters of the traps. We haven’t finished the third one. I think there’s a secret code in the credits of a game about chickens. Haven’t floated into the void yet; I assume we will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After playing the first two, I realized I’d been programming for 17 years and could probably make my own, especially when all the art is 320 pixels wide and that’s about how many pixels I can work with before people give me a sideways look and ask if I really have a liberal arts degree. I decided to base the story loosely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Noware-Peter-Welch-ebook/dp/B077TZRNLD/&quot;&gt;my novel&lt;/a&gt;, for two reasons: first, if the game happens to get the kind of notoriety my novel has not, I might be able to boost sales by claiming the novel can serve as a hint book. Second, I spent nineteen years writing that stupid book, and this seemed like a good a way to manage the withdrawal symptoms. Three weeks later I’d built a rendering engine I’m quite proud of, a simple command and scene logic processor, and accidentally reinvented GIF compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The was only one thing left to do: come up with ways to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was an attempt to marry the arbitrary cruelty of the original quest games to the self-destructive lifestyle of the disaffected and depressed characters in my book. Jacob wakes up on the floor. If he tries to stand up immediately, he stumbles and breaks his head open on a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.stilldrinking.org/blog_images/coffee/headdesk.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He needs more sleep, but if he tries to go back to sleep, he can’t because he’s having a nicotine craving. If he searches, he can find matches to light his last cigarette. Then he can go to sleep, but if he doesn’t put out the cigarette first, the apartment burns down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.stilldrinking.org/blog_images/coffee/burned.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Dead again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he smokes, puts the cigarette out, and sleeps, he can successfully stand up. As long as he doesn’t try to turn on the computer, he can even make it out of the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling confident, I decided to force the player to make a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have big plans for death in this game. I’m importing some void and sorcerer deaths directly from the old quests. In the middle of plot, Jacob’s consciousness is transplanted into a ham sandwich, and you have to eat this ham sandwich in the first scene so Jacob’s future sandwich-self reintegrates with his past-self and the game can continue. Otherwise ham-Jacob just rots away in a dark refrigerator. If you don’t put on a raincoat in the beginning, Jacob gets pneumonia and develops an increasingly irritating cough until he drops dead at the beginning of the last scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cruel and obnoxious as this is, it’s simple to program. The hardest part of writing “if rain and not raincoat: jacob.pneumonia = true” is spelling pneumonia. I only have to draw the coughing animation once, and collapsing dead to the ground from pneumonia is just a minor variation on all the other collapses dead I’ve already drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not even going to directly kill Jacob for not having a cup of coffee. I won’t let him put on the raincoat before making it because I didn’t want to do raincoat variations of all the coffee-making mini animations. I had to rewrite parts of the rendering engine to make coffee. There are thirteen lines of code that do nothing but determine what to say when you look at the coffee maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
'LOOK AT COFFEE MAKER': () =&amp;gt; {
  if( State.scene.state.coffeedrunk ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker has done its job and mercifully drained the
            last life out of the old and savaged grounds.&quot;
  } else if( State.scene.state.brewed ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker has a fresh pot of what is likely coffee in it.&quot; 
  } else if( State.scene.state.brewing ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker is brewing.&quot;
  } else if( State.scene.state.waterinmaker ) {
    return &quot;The coffee maker has fresh water in it, and is ready to brew
            a terrible cup of coffee.&quot;
  } else {
    return &quot;Makes coffee. Whodathunk? There's no water in it, and you don't
            have any fresh coffee, but the grounds already in there have
            only been used twice and can't be THAT moldy.&quot;
  }
}

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the coffee maker have water in it? Does the pot have water in it? Does Jacob have the pot? Is Jacob close enough to the coffee maker to take the pot? Is the water on? Is he close enough to sink to turn water on? Has he poured the water into the coffee maker? Is it finished brewing? These are all conditions that have to be checked and met. I’ve written more code to make coffee than I generally do to write a login form. Coding coffee is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since turning twenty-three, I’ve had a coffee-making subroutine in my brain. Writing code to get a forty-pixel character to make it made me think about the ways that subroutine has failed me. Sometimes I don’t pour the water into the coffee maker and end up with a pot of warm water. Sometimes I don’t put grounds into the maker, which also results in a pot of warm water and is indistinguishable from not pouring the water into the maker. Sometimes I forget to close the lid and the coffee maker pours water back into the well until it all evaporates. I have to trust this subroutine because I haven’t had coffee yet, but it only takes one of many potential neurological hiccups to get an error with no log report. It’s not computer code’s fault that making coffee with it is a pain; it’s inherently a pain to make a cup of coffee. I didn’t even get to the cup: I made Jacob drink it right out of the pot to save myself a few steps, and it’s still two hundred lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coding death and coffee, this seems right. Avoiding premature death is a process of not occupying the same space as fast-moving metal or motivated microbes. Living is mostly a series of repetitive and unrelated tasks. It makes sense that the most tedious things to code are the tedious things that just have to be done. There are no life lessons or gymnastic skills involved in doing dishes, there’s no underlying theory of housework that will reveal itself after a thousand vacuum cleanings. Making coffee is a boring sequence of steps people feel stupid for getting wrong, even though they’re statistically doomed to screw it up now and then. The hard parts of of life are driving to work, eating properly, flossing, and medicating my disease-ridden yet fucking immortal cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t fought any aliens or terrorists, but I can relate to putting on the right outfit to survive another day in a way I can’t relate to being a bullet-resistant sniper. Sierra’s quest games traced the shape of mundane death, at once leaving out the tedious bits, and elevating simple tasks by giving them purpose in an eventually comprehensible chain of cause and effect. They even offered some decent life strategies: look at everything, pick up anything you can, avoid wizards, and always haggle for jetpacks.&lt;/p&gt;
