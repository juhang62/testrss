&lt;h3&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustpython.github.io/demo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;online demo&lt;/a&gt; running on WebAssembly.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test RustPython, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython
$ cd RustPython
$ cargo run demo.py
Hello, RustPython!
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or use the interactive shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo run
Welcome to rustpython
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2+2
4
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full Python-3 environment entirely in Rust (not CPython bindings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clean implementation without compatibility hacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the project is in an early phase, and so is the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustpython.github.io/website/rustpython/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;online documentation&lt;/a&gt; for the latest code on master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also generate documentation locally by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cargo doc &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Including documentation for all dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
$ cargo doc --no-deps --all &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Excluding all dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation HTML files can then be found in the &lt;code&gt;target/doc&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to update the online documentation. Push directly to the &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; branch (or ask a maintainer to do so), this will trigger a Travis build that updates the documentation and WebAssembly demo page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;parser/src&lt;/code&gt;: python lexing, parsing and ast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;vm/src&lt;/code&gt;: python virtual machine
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;builtins.rs&lt;/code&gt;: Builtin functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;compile.rs&lt;/code&gt;: the python compiler from ast to bytecode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt;: python builtin types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;: using the other subcrates to bring rustpython to life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt;: documentation (work in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;py_code_object&lt;/code&gt;: CPython bytecode to rustpython bytecode convertor (work in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wasm&lt;/code&gt;: Binary crate and resources for WebAssembly build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt;: integration test snippets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start contributing, there are a lot of things that need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tasks are listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;. Check issues labeled with &lt;code&gt;good first issue&lt;/code&gt; if you wish to start coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to checkout the sourcecode: builtin functions and object methods are often the simplest and easiest way to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also simply run &lt;code&gt;cargo run tests/snippets/whats_left_to_implement.py&lt;/code&gt; to assist in finding any unimplemented method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test rustpython, there is a collection of python snippets located in the &lt;code&gt;tests/snippets&lt;/code&gt; directory. To run those tests do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; tests
$ pipenv shell
$ pytest -v
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also are some unittests, you can run those will cargo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cargo &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; --all
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now the standard library is under construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play around with other standard libraries for python. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pybee/ouroboros&quot;&gt;ouroboros library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, follow this method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;/GIT
$ git clone git@github.com:pybee/ouroboros.git
$ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; PYTHONPATH=&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;/GIT/ouroboros/ouroboros
$ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; RustPython
$ cargo run -- -c &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;import statistics&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage RustPython only has preliminary support for web assembly. The instructions here are intended for developers or those wishing to run a toy example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, install &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wasm-pack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/whirlwind-tour/basic-usage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wasm-bindgen&lt;/a&gt; should be installed by &lt;code&gt;wasm-pack&lt;/code&gt;. if not, install it yourself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move into the &lt;code&gt;wasm&lt;/code&gt; directory. This directory contains a library crate for interop with python to rust to js and back in &lt;code&gt;wasm/lib&lt;/code&gt;, the demo website found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://rustpython.github.io/demo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://rustpython.github.io/demo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;wasm/demo&lt;/code&gt;, and an example of how to use the crate as a library in one's own JS app in &lt;code&gt;wasm/example&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the demo directory. This is the best way of seeing the changes made to either the library or the JS demo, as the &lt;code&gt;rustpython_wasm&lt;/code&gt; module is set to the global JS variable &lt;code&gt;rp&lt;/code&gt; on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, start the webpack development server. It'll compile the crate and then the demo app. This will likely take a long time, both the wasm-pack portion and the webpack portion (from after it says &quot;Your crate has been correctly compiled&quot;), so be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
npm run dev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now open the webpage on &lt;a href=&quot;https://localhost:8080&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt; and Python code in either the text box or browser devtools with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;rp&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;pyEval&lt;/span&gt;(
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;print(js_vars['a'] * 9)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
  {
    vars&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
      a&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
    }
  }
);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can run &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt; to build the app once, without watching for changes, or &lt;code&gt;npm run dist&lt;/code&gt; to build the app in release mode, both for the crate and webpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code style used is the default rustfmt codestyle. Please format your code accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dotfile madness</title>
<link>https://0x46.net/thoughts/2019/02/01/dotfile-madness/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://0x46.net/thoughts/2019/02/01/dotfile-madness/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are no longer in control of our home directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own home directory contains 25 ordinary files and 144 hidden files. The dotfiles contain data that doesn't belong to me: it belongs to the programmers whose programs decided to hijack the primary location designed as a storage for my personal files. I can't place those dotfiles anywhere else and they will appear again if I try to delete them. All I can do is sit here knowing that in the darkness, behind the scenes, they are there. Waiting in silence. Some of those programmers decided to additionally place some normal files and directories in the same place. Those are clearly visible every time I execute &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; in my home directory. It is beyond me why my home directory ended up up containing a &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directory, &lt;code&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;yarn.lock&lt;/code&gt; file (I have never even consciously used yarn!), some 2 strange log files origination from some Java software clearly using an H2 database, and a &lt;code&gt;Desktop&lt;/code&gt; directory. That last one has been created by Steam, which is quite unfortunate as I simply do not have a desktop or a desktop environment on my machine. I dread the day in which I will hear a loud knock on my door and one of those programmers will barge in informing me that he is going to store a piece of his furniture in the middle of my living room, If I don't mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To those of you reading this: I beg you. Avoid creating files or directories of any kind in your user's &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt; directory in order to store your configuration or data. This practice is bizarre at best and it is time to end it. I am sorry to say that many (if not most) programs are guilty of doing this while there are significantly better places that can be used for storing per-user program data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we will never be able to solve this problem - due to the historical baggage, backward compatibility, software no longer receiving updates or programming villains storing the files wherever they want just to see the world burn - we can at least try to follow some sane practices. While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+RobPikeTheHuman/posts/R58WgWwN9jp&quot;&gt;mistake of introducing the mere concept of a &quot;hidden&quot; file&lt;/a&gt; can't be undone anymore, we can at least try to mitigate its results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular problem has been noticed and solved a long time ago with the creation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html&quot;&gt;XDG Base Directory Specification&lt;/a&gt;. The specification defines a set of environment variables pointing programs to a directory in which their data or configuration should be stored. It is up to the user to set those variables so if the variables are not available the programs are expected to default to a directory defined by the standard and not the user's home directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;User-level variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; defines the base directory relative to which user specific data files should be stored. If &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; is either not set or empty, a default equal to &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/share&lt;/code&gt; should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example usage: storing plugins downloaded by the user, databases created by your program, user's input history, bookmarks, emails, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/code&gt; defines the base directory relative to which user specific configuration files should be stored. If &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/code&gt; is either not set or empty, a default equal to &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.config&lt;/code&gt; should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should use this directory to store user-specific configuration files for your program. You will most likely want to create a default configuration file with sane and sensible default values the first time your program is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CACHE_HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CACHE_HOME&lt;/code&gt; defines the base directory relative to which user specific non-essential data files should be stored. If &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CACHE_HOME&lt;/code&gt; is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.cache should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: caching thumbnails generated by your file manager, songs that the user of a music straming software is often listening to, and so on. Your program should continue to function without any problems if this directory is removed by the user. Ensure that the files that are no longer needed are properly removed. Remember that exceeding the sensible amount of storage space used by your files will most likely upset the user who will quickly track down your program as a culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR&lt;/code&gt; defines the base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential runtime files and other file objects (such as sockets, named pipes, ...) should be stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification lists a series of requirements that have to be fulfilled by this directory. As described by the specification you should use this directory to store sockets and similar files used for communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;System-level variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS&lt;/code&gt; defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for configuration files in addition to the &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/code&gt; base directory. The directories in &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS&lt;/code&gt; should be seperated with a colon ':'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS&lt;/code&gt; is either not set or empty, a value equal to &lt;code&gt;/etc/xdg&lt;/code&gt; should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This directory should be used for storing system-wide configuration files that can be overwriten by user-specific configuration files. This directory would most likely be populated during the installation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_DIRS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_DIRS&lt;/code&gt; defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for data files in addition to the &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; base directory. The directories in &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_DIRS&lt;/code&gt; should be seperated with a colon ':'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_DIRS&lt;/code&gt; is either not set or empty, a value equal to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/&lt;/code&gt; should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: storing plugins or themes that can be used by all users of your program. This directory would most likely be populated during the installation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this work in practice?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the standard is very simple. Read the relevant environment variable and use the default paths defined by the standard if it is missing. You should then append a program-specific directory name to it and create the entire directory tree to store your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example if you were to store configuration files you should use &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/your-program&lt;/code&gt; as your base configuraion directory instead of just storing your files directly in &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/code&gt;. Remember to never hardcode the directories to the default values defined by the standard. Read the environment variable first to allow the user to move those directories if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily migrate your existing programs to use this standard. In order to do so start using the standard when creating new files but keep also checking the old location of the files when reading them. This will allow you to migrate without breaking the program for the users with the configuration or data files that were created by a previous version of your program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the standard to find out more and have a look at the directory hierarchy which is almost certain to be already present in your home directory. In reality a cross-platform library allowing you to get a directory for storing your data will be available for your programming language of choice. On Linux and similar systems, this library will surely use the XDG Base Directory Specification.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;mpossible!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word resonated throughout the large lecture hall. I had just finished describing a revolutionary concept for a new type of matter that my graduate student, Dov Levine, and I had invented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caltech lecture room was packed with scientists from every discipline across campus. The discussion had gone remarkably well. But just as the last of the crowd was filing out, there arose a familiar, booming voice and that word: ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Impossible!&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have recognized that distinctive, gravelly voice with the unmistakable New York accent with my eyes closed. Standing before me was my scientific idol, the legendary physicist Richard Feynman, with his shock of graying, shoulder-length hair, wearing his characteristic white shirt, along with a disarming, devilish smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/15694_99407a87a33e79517280e0fdacdaa713.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;Richard Feynman
&lt;p&gt;Feynman had won a Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work developing the first quantum theory of electromagnetism. Within the scientific community, he was already considered one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the 20th century. He would eventually achieve iconic status with the general public, as well, because of his pivotal role identifying the cause of the Challenger space shuttle disaster and his two bestselling books, &lt;em&gt;Surely You‚Äôre Joking, Mr. Feynman!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a wonderfully playful sense of humor, and was notorious for his elaborate practical jokes. But when it came to science, Feynman was always uncompromisingly honest and brutally critical, which made him an especially terrifying presence during scientific seminars. One could anticipate that he would interrupt and publicly challenge a speaker the moment he heard something that was, in his mind, imprecise or inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had been keenly aware of Feynman‚Äôs presence when he entered the lecture hall just before my presentation began and took his usual seat in the front row. I kept a careful watch on him out of the corner of my eye throughout the presentation, awaiting any potential outburst. But Feynman never interrupted and never raised an objection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he fact that Feynman came forward to confront me after the talk was something that probably would have petrified many scientists. But this was not our first encounter. I had been lucky enough to work closely with Feynman when I was an undergraduate at Caltech about a decade earlier and had nothing but admiration and affection for him. Feynman changed my life through his writings, lectures, and personal mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first arrived on campus as a freshman in 1970, my intention was to major in biology or mathematics. I had never been particularly interested in physics in high school. But I knew that every Caltech undergraduate was required to take two years of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly discovered that freshman physics was wickedly hard, thanks in large part to the textbook, &lt;em&gt;The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume 1&lt;/em&gt;. The book was less of a traditional textbook than a collection of brilliant essays based on a famous series of freshman physics lectures that Feynman delivered in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feynman showed me that it is acceptable to explore a diversity of fields if that is where your curiosity leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike any other physics textbook that I have ever encountered, &lt;em&gt;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&lt;/em&gt; never bothers to explain how to solve any problems, which made trying to complete the daunting homework assignments challenging and time-consuming. What the essays did provide, however, was something much more valuable‚Äîdeep insights into Feynman‚Äôs original way of thinking about science. Generations have benefited from the &lt;em&gt;Feynman Lectures&lt;/em&gt;. For me, the experience was an absolute revelation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, I felt like my skull had been pried open and my brain rewired. I began to think like a physicist, and loved it. Like many other scientists of my generation, I was proud to adopt Feynman as my hero. I scuttled my original academic plans about biology and mathematics and decided to pursue physics with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can remember a few times during my freshman year when I screwed up enough courage to say hello to Feynman before a seminar. Anything more would have been unimaginable at the time. But in my junior year, my roommate and I somehow summoned the nerve to knock on his office door to ask if he might consider teaching an unofficial course in which he would meet once a week with undergraduates like us to answer questions about anything we might ask. The whole thing would be informal, we told him. No homework, no tests, no grades, and no course credit. We knew he was an iconoclast with no patience for bureaucracy, and were hoping the lack of structure would appeal to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Alan Lightman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have in my hand a little book titled The Starry Messenger (Sidereus Nuncius in its original Latin), written by the Italian mathematician and scientist Galileo Galilei in 1610. There were 550 books in the first printing of Messenger. One...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/58/Self/when-the-heavens-stopped-being-perfect&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;when-the-heavens-stopped-being-perfect&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade or so earlier, Feynman had given a similar class, but solely for freshmen and only for one quarter per year. Now we were asking him to do the same thing for a full year and to make it available for all undergraduates, especially third- and fourth-year students like ourselves who were likely to ask more advanced questions. We suggested the new course be called ‚ÄúPhysics X,‚Äù the same as his earlier one, to make it clear to everyone that it was completely off the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feynman thought a moment and, much to our surprise, replied ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù So every week for the next two years, my roommate and I joined dozens of other lucky students for a riveting and unforgettable afternoon with Dick Feynman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics X always began with him entering the lecture hall and asking if anyone had any questions. Occasionally, someone wanted to ask about a topic on which Feynman was expert. Naturally, his answers to those questions were masterful. In other cases, though, it was clear that Feynman had never thought about the question before. I always found those moments especially fascinating because I had the chance to watch how he engaged and struggled with a topic for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vividly recall asking him something I considered intriguing, even though I was afraid he might think it trivial. ‚ÄúWhat color is a shadow?‚Äù I wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking back and forth in front of the lecture room for a minute, Feynman grabbed on to the question with gusto. He launched into a discussion of the subtle gradations and variations in a shadow, then the nature of light, then the perception of color, then shadows on the moon, then earthshine on the moon, then the formation of the moon, and so on, and so on, and so on. I was spellbound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my senior year, Dick agreed to be my mentor on a series of research projects. Now I was able to witness his method of attacking problems even more closely. I also experienced his sharp, critical tongue whenever his high expectations were not met. He called out my mistakes using words like ‚Äúcrazy,‚Äù ‚Äúnuts,‚Äù ‚Äúridiculous,‚Äù and ‚Äústupid.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harsh words stung at first, and caused me to question whether I belonged in theoretical physics. But I couldn‚Äôt help noticing that Dick did not seem to take the critical comments as seriously as I did. In the next breath, he would always be encouraging me to try a different approach and inviting me to return when I made progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things Feynman ever taught me was that some of the most exciting scientific surprises can be discovered in everyday phenomena. All you need do is take the time to observe things carefully and ask yourself good questions. He also influenced my belief that there is no reason to succumb to external pressures that try to force you to specialize in a single area of science, as many scientists do. Feynman showed me by example that it is acceptable to explore a diversity of fields if that is where your curiosity leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;ne of our exchanges during my final term at Caltech was particularly memorable. I was explaining a mathematical scheme that I had developed to predict the behavior of a Super Ball, the rubbery, super-elastic ball that was especially popular at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a challenging problem because a Super Ball changes direction with every bounce. I wanted to add another layer of complexity by trying to predict how the Super Ball would bounce along a sequence of surfaces set at different angles. For example, I calculated the trajectory as it bounced from the floor to the underside of a table to a slanted plane and then off the wall. The seemingly random movements were entirely predictable, according to the laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I was, standing in front of Richard Feynman explaining that these long-standing rules were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed Feynman one of my calculations. It predicted that I could throw the Super Ball and that, after a complicated set of bounces, it would return right back to my hand. I handed him the paper and he took a glance at my equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible!‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impossible?&lt;/em&gt; I was taken aback by the word. It was something new from him. Not the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äústupid‚Äù that I had come to occasionally expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhy do you think it‚Äôs impossible?‚Äù I asked nervously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feynman pointed out his concern. According to my formula, if someone were to release the Super Ball from a height with a certain spin, the ball would bounce and careen off nearly sideways at a low angle to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs clearly impossible, Paul,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I glanced down to my equations and saw that, indeed, my prediction did imply that the ball would bounce and take off at a low angle. But I wasn‚Äôt so sure that was impossible, even if it seemed counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was now experienced enough to push back. ‚ÄúOkay, then,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI have never tried this experiment before, but let‚Äôs give it a shot right here in your office.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled a Super Ball out of my pocket and Feynman watched me drop it with the prescribed spin. Sure enough, the ball took off in precisely the direction that my equations predicted, scooting sideways at a low angle off the floor, exactly the way Feynman had thought was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a flash, he deduced his mistake. He had not accounted for the extreme stickiness of the Super Ball surface, which affected how the spin influenced the ball‚Äôs trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHow stupid!‚Äù Feynman said out loud, using the same exact tone of voice he sometimes used to criticize me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two years of working together, I finally knew for sure what I had long suspected: ‚ÄúStupid‚Äù was just an expression Feynman applied to everyone, including himself, as a way to focus attention on an error so it was never made again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned that ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù when used by Feynman, did not necessarily mean ‚Äúunachievable‚Äù or ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù Sometimes it meant, ‚ÄúWow! Here is something amazing that contradicts what we would normally expect to be true. This is worth understanding!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 11 years later, when Feynman approached me after my lecture with a playful smile and jokingly pronounced my theory ‚ÄúImpossible!‚Äù I was pretty sure I knew what he meant. The subject of my talk, a radically new form of matter known as ‚Äúquasicrystals,‚Äù conflicted with principles he thought were true. It was therefore interesting and worth understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;eynman walked up to the table where I had set up an experiment to demonstrate the idea. He pointed to it and demanded, ‚ÄúShow me again!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flipped the switch to start the demonstration and Feynman stood motionless. With his own eyes, he was witnessing a clear violation of one of the most well-known principles in science. It was something so basic that he had described it in the &lt;em&gt;Feynman Lectures&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, the principles had been taught to every young scientist for nearly 200 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, here I was, standing in front of Richard Feynman explaining that these long-standing rules were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystals were not the only possible forms of matter with orderly arrangements of atoms and pinpoint diffraction patterns. There was now a vast new world of possibilities with its own set of rules, which we named quasicrystals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the name to make clear how the new materials differ from ordinary crystals. Both materials consist of groups of atoms that repeat throughout the entire structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups of atoms in crystals repeat at regular intervals, just like the five known patterns. In quasicrystals, however, different groups repeat at distinct intervals. Our inspiration was a two-dimensional pattern known as a Penrose tiling, which is an unusual pattern that contains two different types of tiles that repeat at two incommensurate intervals. Mathematicians call such a pattern quasiperiodic. Hence, we dubbed our theoretical discovery ‚Äúquasiperiodic crystals‚Äù or ‚Äúquasicrystals,‚Äù for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My little demonstration for Feynman was designed to prove my case using a laser and a slide with a photograph of a quasiperiodic pattern. I flipped on the laser, as Feynman had directed, and aimed the beam so that it passed through the slide onto the distant wall. The laser light produced the same effect as X-rays passing through the channels between atoms: It created a diffraction pattern, like the one pictured in the photo below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned off the overhead lights so that Feynman could get a good look at the signature snowflake pattern of pinpoints on the wall. It was unlike any other diffraction pattern that Feynman had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;overlap-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;overlap-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/15695_767d3dd25ed652d33fa7743c0c2400fa.png&quot; alt=&quot;Steinhardt_CORNERART&quot;/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;overlap-text&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pointed out to him, as I had done during the lecture, that the brightest spots formed rings of ten that were concentric. That was unheard of. One could also see groups of pinpoints that formed pentagons, revealing a symmetry that was thought to be absolutely forbidden in the natural world. A closer look revealed yet more spots between the pinpoints. And spots between those spots. And yet more spots still.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feynman asked to look more closely at the slide. I switched the lights back on and removed it from the holder and gave it to him. The image on the slide was so reduced that it was hard to appreciate the detail, so I also handed him an enlargement of the tiling pattern, which he put down on the table in front of the laser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few moments passed in silence. I began to feel like a student again, waiting for Feynman to react to the latest cockamamie idea I had come up with. He stared at the enlargement on the table, reinserted the slide in the holder, and switched on the laser himself. His eyes went back and forth between the printed enlargement on the table, up to the laser pattern on the wall, then back down again to the enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúImpossible!‚Äù Feynman finally said. I nodded in agreement and smiled, because I knew that to be one of his greatest compliments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked back up at the wall, shaking his head. ‚ÄúAbsolutely impossible! That is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, without saying another word, Dick Feynman looked at me with delight and gave me a huge, devilish smile.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>If San Francisco is so great, why is everyone I love leaving?</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;jo0S6j&quot;&gt;I‚Äôm driving down the 101 toward San Francisco International Airport. A gray blanket of fog pours over the hills in the distance, smothering what would be a luminous California sunset. Eleanor is sitting next to me in the passenger seat taking deep breaths. She does not like to fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ecd7&quot;&gt;I hesitate, then finally ask what‚Äôs on her mind, cutting the air between us. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to put any pressure on you, but since this is the last time we‚Äôll be hanging out for a while, I feel like we have drifted apart over the last year. Is there something I did wrong? Is there something you want to tell me? You know, before you leave?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;821d&quot;&gt;We are driving to her one-way flight bound for Pittsburgh. She‚Äôs moving out of the San Francisco Bay Area, where we have both lived since we were kids. Our parents, who were themselves mixed transplants from New England and other parts of California, settled in the Bay in the ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô90s. Eleanor and I met in high school‚Äîtwo weirdos who recognized each other‚Äôs outsider-looking-in approach to the world. Now on the cusp of 30, we have 16 years of friendship between us. We did a podcast together. She went to work with me the day after my father died. We have gotten lost in the desert together, twice (before smartphones). On separate occasions, we have cleaned up each other‚Äôs vomit. We were once referred to as ‚Äúhetero life mates.‚Äù And today she is leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3680&quot;&gt;There are other friends out in Pittsburgh who have made a calm life as artists, cooks, house-cleaners, and creatives: an impossibility in the Bay Area, unless you have family assistance. Eleanor visited them a few months ago, and, charmed by their stability, the brick-paved streets, and the affordable apartments that lined them, it became impossible for her not to see how well she could do there too. Among other talents, she is, first and foremost, an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e778&quot;&gt;I‚Äôm not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ab2a&quot;&gt;I‚Äôm telling her ‚ÄúI feel like we‚Äôve drifted apart.‚Äù What I really want to say is ‚ÄúWhat could I have done to make you stay?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7f8c&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing, really,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI mean, the political climate has been hard. But also it‚Äôs just the Bay. Inviting people out to Stinson is easy; getting people to visit me when I have nowhere to host them is harder.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d1da&quot;&gt;Several months ago, she had made the difficult decision to move back onto a small corner of her parents beach-town property, after her urban East Bay house became waterlogged during the rainstorms of 2016. We had to move her out over a weekend, after the mold took half the furniture and gave her roommate pneumonia in both lungs. I touched swollen blisters of stagnant rainwater pulsing on her walls. After emailing the landlord about the issues, the housemates abandoned the property. He then successfully sued them in accordance with California tenant laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a10b&quot;&gt;Although moving back to your parents‚Äô home is never ideal, Eleanor didn‚Äôt have a lot of other options. But Stinson was not the little village she had left behind for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4b73&quot;&gt;While only accessible by a narrow 10-mile strip of road lined by falling rocks and perilous sea cliffs, Stinson Beach is nevertheless one of the most popular day trips for San Francisco urbanites. Once a salty refuge for dendrophilic introverts and quiet hippies of means, Stinson spent the last few years transforming into a seaside ‚Äúsimpler times‚Äù theme park for San Francisco‚Äôs stratospherically wealthy. Eleanor had watched her foggy hometown gorge with tourists in $300 jeans on a mission for an idyllic, sand-weathered NorCal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f053&quot;&gt;But hating rich tourists simply for flooding the place with money is not the reason Eleanor is leaving the Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;8jL3bq&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;‚ÄúWe understand that with our respective shares of the rent, we could be paying mortgages on entire houses in Denver or Austin. But we are here.‚Äù&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4ca2&quot;&gt;She was a manager at an artisanal goods boutique, which directly served this crowd of fast-culture beneficiaries hungry for slow-culture products. She is also the child of interracial parents, who built their own house in Stinson when she was little more than a baby. The town was essentially her cocoon for over 15 years. As an adult, she quickly got hired at the boutique because, to quote Eleanor, ‚Äúthe owners know the signs of a townie who has returned with swallowed pride and no prospects.‚Äù But the tourists did not know these signs. The new deal for living in Stinson‚Äîher hometown‚Äîwas getting used to hearing ‚ÄúWhere are you from? Here? No way!‚Äù repeatedly from rich white people, who didn‚Äôt know how to fit a brown girl in their vision of an authentic seaside experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;12ac&quot;&gt;She would then go home to an in-law unit, while those people retired to one of the many lavish Airbnbs that have popped up over the last decade. ‚ÄúImagine working at Disneyland, then going home to your place in the back of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride while drunk frat grads puke into the water,‚Äù she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9141&quot;&gt;To be clear, she loved her town and its bearing in the coastal California fantasy. She wanted to share it, brag about it, celebrate it. But selling bourgeoise yogurt crocks and $100 bottles of wine to people who didn‚Äôt see her as part of their shabby-chic fantasy was becoming difficult to bear. She was also onboarding other displaced ‚Äúvillage kids‚Äù who were doing exactly what she was doing: moving back home, into their parents‚Äô offices, in-law units, and backyards. Having only kind words and a dead-end service job to offer them was making her grow thorns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2506&quot;&gt;She was unhappy. The boutique was becoming a psychological warfare zone. She had tried her hand doing sales at a startup, but the work was soul-fraying. Art made her happy, and she was genuinely talented, but working at a couture costume shop and an internationally acclaimed ceramics studio wasn‚Äôt enough to pay the bills. She couldn‚Äôt afford to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4585&quot;&gt;The muse was not only dead‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt afford the resuscitation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ad74&quot;&gt;This is why I never doubted her desire to leave the Bay Area. But my guilt came from somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c2b0&quot;&gt;I had not been facing these problems. I dabble in dance, but I was too cowardly to ever accept the life of an artist. I work in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;dmJhIg&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;‚ÄúLeaving the Bay Area is the best thing you can do right now, if you have a dream.‚Äù&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rpftdd&quot;&gt;To clarify, I am not a programmer. I say I am a ‚Äútechie‚Äù in the sense that I have positioned myself, through a combination of hard work, luck, and privilege, to benefit from the startup bomb that exploded in my backyard 10 years ago. I was handed a sales job by a family friend right out of college, and I took it greedily, not looking back until, well, now. Mostly I have worked in sales, marketing, and user research. For my efforts, I live in a gritty but familial part of the sprawling, controversial metropolis of Oakland. I have my own en suite bathroom and a tiny balcony where I can grow useless amounts of herbs and play at ‚Äúconnecting to the land.‚Äù My roommate is a professional journalist with a blue checkmark on Twitter. We‚Äôre both in our 30s. We understand that with our respective shares of the rent, we could be paying mortgages on entire houses in Denver or Austin. But we are here. Our friends (what‚Äôs left of them) and family are here; my job network is here. Two fully employed middle-class women in their 30s splitting bills on Venmo and figuring out how to most diplomatically accuse the other of eating more of the peanut butter. This is normal in the Bay Area. Only programmers live alone. Only rich programmers own houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7f92&quot;&gt;Setting aside for a moment Oakland‚Äôs own gentrification culture war (which would be another 20-minute essay), it is a two-hour drive away from Eleanor‚Äôs home in Stinson. It should only be an hour, but the traffic on the 580 moved from ‚Äúrush-hour average‚Äù to ‚Äúperpetual nightmare‚Äù sometime in 2014. With a regular work week, you don‚Äôt often have four hours to spare for a round-trip drive to see a friend‚Äîeven the one who wouldn‚Äôt leave your side when your dad died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;2f2d&quot;&gt;Had we drifted? Of course we had. But it was more than the traffic and geography that was the source of my guilt. I felt I had played into the system that was financially and culturally kicking her out. And I‚Äôd realized it for the first time just as she was leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c565&quot;&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared I haven‚Äôt been a good enough friend to you,‚Äù I confess to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0030&quot;&gt;‚ÄúI do feel loved and supported,‚Äù she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8140&quot;&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad,‚Äù I say. And I mean it. I feel greedy for this absolution because I realize beyond the guilt, there‚Äôs another feeling: paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eea8&quot;&gt;For the first time, while sitting in full-stop traffic before the Bay Bridge in the ironically named ‚Äúfastrak‚Äù lane, I count them in my head: 11 people I care about have left California in the past two years. Eleanor is number 12, and apparently the final straw that‚Äôs really making me pause and think, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7cdd&quot;&gt;She shifts next to me in the dead-stop traffic. I know her well enough at this point to know she is teeming with anxiety. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make the flight. We left early,‚Äù I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8fdf&quot;&gt;‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9793&quot;&gt;But we both know this is not why she‚Äôs nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8c79&quot;&gt;She‚Äôs nervous about the life shift. The constant cloud of ‚Äúfailure‚Äù that threatens to downpour on you at any minute if you live in the Bay Area is still looming over her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0798&quot;&gt;What she doesn‚Äôt know yet is that this cloud, for her, is about to dissipate. Leaving the Bay Area is the best thing you can do right now, if you have a dream. She‚Äôs going to be fine. She just doesn‚Äôt know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0d91&quot;&gt;Moving, especially moving across the country, is an enormous, yet hardly uncommon, life shift. Leaving one‚Äôs hometown to forge a better future in a new city is one of the most traditional adult rites of passage that we as Americans have. Eleanor and I had a few friends who left the Bay around 2012 and 2013 for career opportunities, to be with a spouse, or to take a rare internship. We wished them well. It was hard, but normal. We were in our early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;96f3&quot;&gt;There‚Äôs something not normal, however, about the number of people who have taken flight out of California in the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2269&quot;&gt;If you go to Austin, New Orleans, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, and Denver‚Äîto name just a few‚Äîyou can easily find folks transplanted from other cities and states. You can also easily find a band of locals bemoaning, specifically, the ‚Äúfucking Californians‚Äù who are flooding their home, driving up rents, installing yoga studios, polluting the local vibe with new technology, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/Why-people-love-to-hate-Californians-11101058.php&quot;&gt;generally making everything suck while sipping kale juice&lt;/a&gt;. We‚Äôre threatening Austin‚Äôs weirdness and erasing Bozeman‚Äôs cowboys. We seem to be everywhere you look, ruining other cities, apparently by not staying where we ought to‚Äîback in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5265&quot;&gt;It would appear we are fleeing California like it‚Äôs on fire (which, actually, it literally is lately); only large quantities of ‚Äúforeign‚Äù people moving into one area typically disrupt culture and incite hatred like that. Yet San Francisco rent continues to lead the nation based on white-hot demand. This doesn‚Äôt really make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2ec3&quot;&gt;Let me offer a snapshot of San Francisco in 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f2ff&quot;&gt;A friend is having a birthday party at a funky dive bar in the Mission and has invited you. Despite the ostensibly blue-collar aesthetic, you pay $14 for a cocktail containing house-made lavender syrup and organic gin. You lean against a vintage pinball machine, a shrine to the predigital adolescence half the people in the bar never had, and proceed to make small talk with the other guests, asking, ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5534&quot;&gt;They reply: ‚ÄúWisconsin.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2fc6&quot;&gt;‚ÄúTexas.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;46cf&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWashington.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5b7e&quot;&gt;‚ÄúLos Angeles.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;540f&quot;&gt;‚ÄúIllinois.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;44b7&quot;&gt;‚ÄúBoston.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4524&quot;&gt;‚ÄúNorth Carolina.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fafb&quot;&gt;And, of course, you encounter several international immigrants from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, who never ever seem to complain about housing costs, traffic, Whole Foods, or you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;611a&quot;&gt;One person says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Bay Area native.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8584&quot;&gt;Being a Bay Area native does not mean this person is Miwok or Ohlone (two Native American tribes who originally lived here). It just means they lived in the Bay before tech took off. It‚Äôs like wearing an invisible bachelorette party sash that says: ‚ÄúThe startup tsunami basically came to me. I am both riding the wave &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I can complain about it.‚Äù (Or, depending on their shoes, it could mean, ‚ÄúMy dad founded a venture capital firm and my apartment‚Äôs lot is worth more than your entire life.‚Äù) This person will proceed to complain about rent and the general loss of culture they have witnessed over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;875a&quot;&gt;But what this ‚Äúnative‚Äù Bay Area kid &lt;em&gt;won‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; do is start blaming the guy from North Carolina or Wisconsin or Boston‚Äîbasically every other person in the bar‚Äîfor propelling the rents into the sky and inadvertently forcing the ‚Äúlocals‚Äù to flee. Someone may disagree with me here, but I just haven‚Äôt seen it done. If the conversation actually manages to advance far enough into blaming something for the Bay‚Äôs loss of culture and housing woes, the finger falls on the &lt;em&gt;companies&lt;/em&gt; who employ these newcomers: Google, Genentech, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, etc. Even still, this finger of blame rarely gets raised above the hip; we use these companies‚Äô products or benefit from their research every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b62e&quot;&gt;There is an apocalyptic amount of people moving into California, and no one blames them for the overcrowding and the shifting culture. But when too many Californians leave California and settle in, say, Portland, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/03/go-back-to-california-painted-on-prius-in-portland/&quot;&gt;they are blamed for ruining the place by way of simply being themselves&lt;/a&gt;. I visited Seattle for the first time a month ago and was warned someone might throw a bottle at my car for my California plates. In Portland, I saw ‚ÄúNo Californians‚Äù signs slapped onto ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù signs in yards. In Denver, I read news articles about friendlier locals advising Californians to tell people they were from literally anywhere else. You can Google virtually any city plus the phrase ‚Äúhate Californians‚Äù and find pages of forums and articles giving voice to the hatred of Golden State jerks ‚Äúruining‚Äù cities. This is not true for other domestic migrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;98d7&quot;&gt;It is apparently Californians who are unique in their snobbery and ability to ruin other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;14ec&quot;&gt;Yet I am having trouble feeling snobbish and superior when I‚Äôm losing friend after friend after friend to cities that don‚Äôt make it impossible to be a teacher, a painter, a bakery owner, or even a damn barista in order to have a full fridge and a fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;0QAKGZ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want California to stop being a hub of brilliant, ambitious people. What I want is for California to be affordable to more than one kind of life.‚Äù&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e218&quot;&gt;Also, above all, I don‚Äôt want California to stop growing and benefiting from all the international and domestic migrants who flock here for opportunity and/or safety. Despite the fact that my rent makes some people do spit-takes, I am still a beneficiary of an inflated Bay Area salary. On a daily basis, I get to work with freakishly brave, casually brilliant minds, curated and imported not just from across the United States, but from India, China, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, and South America. At a dinner party, I get to sound like a comic book super scientist (‚Äúwe‚Äôre finding the algorithm for love‚Äù) or a Bond villain‚Äôs understudy (‚Äúwe‚Äôre building a robot army‚Äù). I am also proud to be part of a liberal community that is trying to be a safe zone for people who would otherwise be persecuted in other parts of the country or the world. And, to frost the cake, I get to experience all of this while being surrounded by majestic redwood forests, nationally conserved seashores, famous wines, temperate weather, and the entire food, music, and art accessory package that comes with being in a world-class city that international business kings and technology icons call ‚Äúhome.‚Äù Holy shit. The Bay Area is fucking awesome, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;13cf&quot;&gt;Yeah. Except for the part where everyone I love is leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;01d4&quot;&gt;I don‚Äôt want California to stop being a hub of brilliant, ambitious people. What I want is for California to be affordable to more than one kind of life. And I want the record set straight about who exactly is moving where and, above all, why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6222&quot;&gt;We are witnessing two migrations. One is the continuation of the Californian dream, where young people flock here for gold and glory, ready to hustle and disrupt, hammering to hit the motherlode and laughing at the odds. The other is the migration of young people &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of California, which seems to have affected everyone I know, but which I rarely hear examined. These people want to be artists, teachers, blacksmiths, therapists, mechanics, and musicians. They want to have children, open bakeries, own a house. But they can‚Äôt. There is no room here for those kinds of dreams anymore. They hear about someone‚Äôs success in New Orleans, Kansas City, or Pittsburgh, and they leave their families and communities behind on the chance they will, ironically, strike gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;67cb&quot;&gt;To the angry locals of Portland, Seattle, Denver, New Orleans, Kansas City, Phoenix, Austin, and elsewhere, please hear this defense: The Californians who are coming in and ‚Äúruining‚Äù your cities are not snobs. They don‚Äôt have trust funds. They aren‚Äôt entitled. They are the opposite. They have been kicked out of their own backyards for not learning Python fast enough or not having a dad who could introduce them to VC firms or not wanting to live in their family‚Äôs in-law unit at age 30 or not being able to afford a $2,000/month studio on a $20/hour paycheck. They aren‚Äôt techies; they had the audacity to want something besides tech. They are some of our best, most creative, most hardworking people‚Äîand you are getting them. We are losing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;24a1&quot;&gt;We are kind to your friends who move here to grow, to start things, to feel safe, to dream. So, please, be kind to my friends and their dreams too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;ccef&quot;&gt;At SFO, I watch as Eleanor walks inside the terminal with all her possessions: two trunks and a carry-on full of handmade ceramics. We hug. We tell each other I love you‚Äîsomething I rarely say‚Äîpromise to keep in touch, and say all the other sentiments humans use to anesthetize loss. She turns the corner and is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;67c3&quot;&gt;I get back into my car. I take a breath. Instantly I crumple, like an angry teenager, gasping and wiping tears all over my face. I want to slam the steering wheel and have my own private ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt fair‚Äù meltdown. But I don‚Äôt. The meter maids at SFO are fierce and will bear down on you if you idle in passenger loading for more than 30 seconds. The airport is a zoo of emergency lights, Ubers competing for space, attendants blaring whistles. At San Francisco‚Äôs busy pace, there is no time for examining loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f88c&quot;&gt;I take another breath, remembering that I am happy for her. I‚Äôm an adult. People move all the time. This is normal. It‚Äôs not my fault she‚Äôs gone, that all 12 of them are gone. Normal. People move all the time. Nothing I could have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-end-para&quot; id=&quot;f56e&quot;&gt;I can‚Äôt change the rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;ddwqMl&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: The article initially stated that Airbnbs outnumbered permanent housing by about 3:1. In fact, as of January 31, the number is 58 Airbnb rentals in a town with approximately 340 housing units. We have updated the article accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Homebrew 2.0.0 released</title>
<link>https://brew.sh/2019/02/02/homebrew-2.0.0/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://brew.sh/2019/02/02/homebrew-2.0.0/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I‚Äôd like to announce Homebrew 2.0.0. The most significant changes since 1.9.0 are official support for Linux and Windows 10 (with Windows Subsystem for Linux), &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew cleanup&lt;/code&gt; running automatically, no more options in Homebrew/homebrew-core, and removal of support for OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major changes and deprecations since 1.9.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Homebrew officially supports Linux and Windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). ‚ÄúHomebrew on Linux‚Äù is called ‚ÄúLinuxbrew‚Äù. You can install it in your home directory, so it does not require &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;, and use it to install software that your host distribution‚Äôs package manager does not provide. Linuxbrew uses its own repository for formulae: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-core&quot;&gt;Linuxbrew/homebrew-core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew cleanup&lt;/code&gt; is run periodically (every 30 days) and triggers for individual formula cleanup on reinstall, install or upgrade. You can opt-out of this behaviour by setting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP&lt;/code&gt; variable. This addresses a long-standing complaint where users were surprised by how much disk space Homebrew used if they did not run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew cleanup&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homebrew does not run on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and below. For 10.4 - 10.6 support, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew&quot;&gt;Tigerbrew&lt;/a&gt;. This has allowed us to remove large amounts of legacy code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homebrew does not migrate old, pre-1.0.0 installations from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew&quot;&gt;Homebrew/legacy-homebrew&lt;/a&gt; (formerly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew&quot;&gt;Homebrew/homebrew&lt;/a&gt; repository. This has allowed us to delete legacy code that dealt with migrations from old versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homebrew does not have any formulae with options in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core&quot;&gt;Homebrew/homebrew-core&lt;/a&gt;. Options will still be supported and encouraged by third-party taps. This change allows us to better focus on delivering binary packages rather than options. Formulae with options had to be built from source, could not be tested on our CI system and provided a disproportionate support burden on our volunteer maintainers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other changes since 1.9.0 I‚Äôd like to highlight are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you‚Äôve not tuned in since 1.0.0, here are the major changes since then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all our hard-working maintainers, contributors, sponsors and supporters for getting us this far. Enjoy using Homebrew!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What‚Äôs Wrong with the Raspberry Pi</title>
<link>https://ownyourbits.com/2019/02/02/whats-wrong-with-the-raspberry-pi/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ownyourbits.com/2019/02/02/whats-wrong-with-the-raspberry-pi/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is an incredibly popular device that has a well deserved fame for its affordability, versatility, possibilities and vibrant community. It is easy to find fan projects and publications praising it, but most people are not aware of its weak points until they suffer them and come across the information on the forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to explain some of the personal problems that I have with the Pi, as well as some of the issues people have all the time, most often without realizing it, and finally why I do not recommend it for some applications, specifically NAS kind of services such as NextCloudPi and Open Media Vault. Hopefully this will save me time in order to avoid repeating myself all over the forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had many Raspberry Pis and I have been using them for many years. When the first model came up in 2012, it was a huge milestone for the hobbyist SBC market. Even though there were already some nice boards around, such as the Beagleboard and the Odroid, these were quite pricey and only hardcore hobbyists could understand what they could offer and justify the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pi though, came with a very affordable price tag. It was not that powerful compared to what we already had, but it was so cheap that it exploded in popularity. Blogs, shields and extensions, people sharing their projects, tons of libraries‚Ä¶ the Raspberry Pi was the first one to achieve all that and to this day a thriving community is the biggest reason why I would understand people getting a Pi over other boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is 2019 now, so we can have another look around. In my opinion there is better quality and more open alternatives for the same price. I will try to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Performance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AeroVee_Turbo_5771-700x467.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3289&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AeroVee_Turbo_5771-700x467.jpg 700w, https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AeroVee_Turbo_5771-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AeroVee_Turbo_5771-768x512.jpg 768w, https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AeroVee_Turbo_5771.jpg 1440w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry managed to be that affordable by cutting some corners. The result is a board that is underpowered for some tasks compared to its competition. In particular, it performs poorly in terms of both network and USB functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-3-specs-benchmarks/&quot;&gt;SMSC LAN9514 chip&lt;/a&gt; that connects to the SoC via a single USB channel, acting as a USB-to-Ethernet adaptor and USB hub at the same time. This implies that Ethernet and USB are shared and are competing with each other, which ruins the typical NAS use case of uploading something over the network and storing it to a USB drive, let alone adding RAID to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this same reason, even when last year they finally provided a model with Gigabit Ethernet, the real network performance of the device is nowhere close to real Gigabit performance, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://libre.computer/2018/03/21/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-review-and-comparison/&quot;&gt;around 40MB/s maximum in sheer networking speed, 20MB/s maximum if we are transfering to a USB device&lt;/a&gt;. There have been affordable boards with real Gigabit Ethernet for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually Wi-Fi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=915455#p915455&quot;&gt;doesn‚Äôt go through the SMSC&lt;/a&gt;, but is connected to the BCM4343 chip through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#SDIO_cards&quot;&gt;SDIO&lt;/a&gt; instead, so this bottleneck could somehow be avoided by using Wi-Fi. In any the wireless chip is not great either and would have to compete with other interfering devices in the surroundings for airtime anyway so it‚Äôs not a great alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the reasons stated above I would not recommend the pi to be used in a NAS kind of scenario, be it Open Media Vault or Nextcloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The real brain of the Pi is not open source&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iarpabraininspiredcomputing.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3285&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iarpabraininspiredcomputing.png 620w, https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iarpabraininspiredcomputing-300x145.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been around software freedom discussions, the number one concern in our Linux systems is the presence of closed source binary blobs. I won‚Äôt go into details here but the concern is that those parts of your system can‚Äôt be audited and have access to everything that is going on in our devices. This has led to great efforts by the community, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.replicant.us/&quot;&gt;Android Replicant&lt;/a&gt; to free our systems from any binary blobs, which is a painful, tedious and slow process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in a similar situation with the Raspberry Pi. The CPU and the GPU are embedded in the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2837b0/README.md&quot;&gt;BCM2837B0 chip&lt;/a&gt;. The CPU is a 1400 MHz 64-bit quad core ARM A53 (in the Pi3B), and the GPU is a dual core 32-bit VideoCore IV running at 400MHz. This is common in the mobile device SoC world as saves cost and power and everything is embedded in the same chip. Freescale IMX and Allwinner are competitors using a similar approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have six cores in the latest Pi, but only four of them are ARM. Linux runs on that ARM CPU, we know that, but we might be surprised to learn that Linux on this device is only a second class citizen. The GPU cores run a real time operating system called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threadx&quot;&gt;ThreadX&lt;/a&gt;. This operating system is closed source and rules the system without the open source Linux Kernel being aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Raspberry Pi starts booting the CPU is completely disconnected (technically in &lt;em&gt;reset&lt;/em&gt; state) and the GPU is the one that starts the system. You can have a look at the &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; folder and you will see some of the binary blobs used by the GPU to both start the CPU and run its own ThreadX OS (&lt;em&gt;bootcode.bin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;start.elf&lt;/em&gt;). You can learn more details about the boot process &lt;a href=&quot;https://elinux.org/RPi_Software&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the GPU who mounts the SDcard, gets those blobs and reads the configuration from that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/README.md&quot;&gt;config.txt text file&lt;/a&gt; that we have to edit to configure video settings or overclocking the GPU. Linux is not involved in any of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the GPU has the CPU load the Linux Kernel, it doesn‚Äôt just stay there waiting to act as a &lt;em&gt;graphics-processing-unit&lt;/em&gt;. The GPU is still in charge. Have you ever thought about who is printing those logos when the Pi boots connected to HDMI? or those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/warning-icons.md&quot;&gt;lightning or temperature symbols&lt;/a&gt; when there is throttling going on? Exactly, it is ThreadX on the GPU doing that. Linux is just not aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot know everything the GPU is doing, but we do know some things that it is in charge of. The most relevant one for this discussion is that ThreadX monitors for undervoltage, which is a widespread issue as we will see next, and will underclock the CPU to prevent instructions failing and the CPU to hang, which results in people‚Äôs devices running at 600MHz instead of 1400MHz in the best case. This throttling starts happening at 4.65V and can also be triggered by temperature. Linux and its frequency governor still thinks that is happily running at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is only what we can see. Because the main OS is closed source we have not way of knowing what else it is doing or is capable of doing which will always be a concern for privacy aware individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is at least one patent included in the closed source blob that will prevent it from being released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=201449&quot;&gt;until at least 2025&lt;/a&gt;, but we don‚Äôt know if there is any intention of doing so even then. There have been attempts at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv&quot;&gt;reverse engineering the VideoCore IV&lt;/a&gt; and generating open source firmware for the VideoCore IV, but unfortunately &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/christinaa/rpi-open-firmware/issues/37&quot;&gt;the project died&lt;/a&gt; before getting to produce anything useful. Just like with Android blobs, this is incredibly hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Powering issues&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5V3A-raspberrypi-power-supply-700x656.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3284&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5V3A-raspberrypi-power-supply-700x656.jpg 700w, https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5V3A-raspberrypi-power-supply-300x281.jpg 300w, https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5V3A-raspberrypi-power-supply-768x720.jpg 768w, https://ownyourbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5V3A-raspberrypi-power-supply.jpg 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a technical fault of the Raspberry Pi, but more of a very typical user mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first model barely used 80 mA, but each new generation is more powerful than the previous one, and for that reason also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/power-consumption&quot;&gt;more power hungry&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, many users connect USB devices that also draw power, unless they come with their own power supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microUSB connector was only originally designed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://read.pudn.com/downloads114/doc/comm/476505/usb_20_040908/usb_20/Micro-USB_final/Micro-USB_1_01.pdf&quot;&gt;provide 1.8A&lt;/a&gt;, and even though that is an old standard and you can find chargers that perform just fine at more than that, so many people try to reuse old phone 1A chargers or buy cheap adaptors online to power their Raspberry Pis. The Pi is a computer, it requires a good quality, stable power supply that provides a stable 5V at the input and is capable of providing 2.5A. Not only the transformer needs to be decent, but also the connection needs to be good (or there will be a voltage drop) but more importantly, the &lt;em&gt;cable&lt;/em&gt; needs to be good, or there will be a big drop along it. Bad cables are even more typical to find than unstable voltage supplies, so please, use a good cable, maybe a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluejeanscable.com/articles/what-does-wire-gage-mean.htm&quot;&gt;20AWG&lt;/a&gt; or similar, or just get the official power supply. The take away is that not any USB charger is going to work properly, even if it is 2.5A 5V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this to was we saw in the last section and we can begin to see the big picture. Most users are running their devices undervolted, and the GPU is hiding this from them, so they are actually running underclocked at 600MHz, almost as bad as the original ARMv6 pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases not even the GPU efforts are enough and the system randomly fails or just hangs, possibly corrupting data or damaging the SD card. This mostly happens &lt;em&gt;under load&lt;/em&gt; which is when the transistors require more power. Then, the user goes to the forums and complaints: &lt;em&gt;my power supply&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;is just fine, I just ran this and that and it didn‚Äôt fail&lt;/em&gt;. Of course this is not true, but often they won‚Äôt believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this is what the Japanese would call &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka_yoke&quot;&gt;Poka Yoke&lt;/a&gt;, in other words, we should design our systems in order to prevent the user to shoot itself in the foot, &lt;em&gt;by design.&lt;/em&gt; Again, the official power supply is very good quality for the price and I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt like that they throttle the board silently outside of my control. I would rather have the system hang so I can realize what is going on and replace the PSU than to fool users and have them complaint in frustration &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bamarni/pi64/issues/66#issuecomment-374950032&quot;&gt;all over the internet&lt;/a&gt;. It is hard to imagine a reason why the developers of the Pi would do this if it is not to hide the Poka Yoke issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the Raspberry Pi has been a very important event in the history of SBCs but today it falls behind in quality, performance and transparency. There are other affordable alternatives out there where developers have given more consideration to those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, I am using the Raspberry Pi as a means to reach my goal of helping people self host their personal cloud services, and given how popular this board is, it still makes sense for me to support it as long as it is useful towards that purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sex censorship killed the internet we love</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/31/sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/31/sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I pop over to Yahoo News and try the same searches, exhaling relief to see 892 news articles for &quot;porn&quot; from outlets ranging from &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;. They're there. It's just that Google's 2018 algorithm upgrade filters out news with the word &quot;porn&quot; in it. Like articles about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/august-ames-porn-suicide-podcast-jon-ronson-lena-misitzis-776110/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;porn performer suicide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allure.com/story/revenge-porn-what-to-do-if-youre-victim&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tips for revenge porn victims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.style.yahoo.com/almost-one-five-parents-think-porn-sites-no-age-limit-134125433.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;parents who oppose porn website age-verification&lt;/a&gt; (turns out, today's parents are more afraid of data collection than their kids watching porn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories with the word &quot;porn&quot; in them are important because they're about censorship, sexual health, business trends, sex work, politics, gender and women. They're about people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not for the world's most popular search engine. Google's war on sex took root in 2011 when Google Plus launched with a strict no-sex policy. In 2013, the company enacted a porn purge across Blogger, and Android's Google Keyboard was updated to exclude more than1,400 &quot;inappropriate&quot; words, like &quot;lovemaking,&quot; &quot;condom,&quot; and &quot;STI.&quot; In 2014 Google Play banned sex-themed apps, and an algorithm change in Search destroyed organic results for sex websites. That same year Google made changes to its AdWords policies to prohibit sex-related advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Google launched in 1998, Nerve was one of the internet's leading websites. It was an online magazine about sex with articles and featured erotic artists, busy personals, packed forums. It published terrific sex books by writers and photographers, and had a wildly popular free blogging service (one of the first). From 1997 through the early '00s, Nerve was the fun, exciting, sex-positive place to be and hang out, bursting with creative communities, optimism, and hope that a vital future was being explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, Nerve represented a new era in which we could finally, freely talk about sex, gender, orientation, sex culture -- and exchange ideas. Thanks to Nerve's &quot;literate smut&quot; tagline and ethos, private acts of creation could make tortured people feel valid and whole. People don't make sites like Nerve anymore. No one can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time the internet made you feel good?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Par8006191&quot; data-caption=&quot;A visitor looks at a Picasso painting study for 'Les demoiselles d'Avignon' nude with raised arms during the press day at the Picasso museum, on October 18, 2014 in Paris.

&lt;p&gt;I can feel my anxiety climbing as I search for art and photography. I am looking for black erotic art, because this kind of visibility matters to me. Like the millions of people who enjoyed Tumblr, I do not want the stereotypes and advertising assault of commercial porn 'tube' sites, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2015/12/98830/ethical-porn-consumer-feminist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;performers say profit unfairly off their hard work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to have a living, breathing museum-of-sex culture online. But in December 2018, Tumblr &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/07/the-internet-war-on-sex-is-here/&quot;&gt;banned and removed adult content from its service&lt;/a&gt;. Estimated loss: at least 12.5 million blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tumblr started in 2007, it made people feel like the battle to defend erotic art as socially and sexually valid was won, and the necessity of sexual communities was cemented. We found out so much, like that transgender people had hot sex and great erotic art too, and this was ... just incredibly cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tumblr erased millions of sex blogs and communities overnight, many lamented that without the website they would've been lost and suicidal trying to figure out their sexuality. When I worked the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfsi.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sex crisis call lines&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, before Tumblr, our most common call was from teens in abstinence-only education states who did not know how to prevent sexual disease, infections, injuries or pregnancy ‚Äî and youth who were terrified they weren't &quot;normal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids we spoke to were afraid and alone. At the call center, we sometimes doubled as a suicide crisis line (the office next to ours was, in fact, the suicide hotline). I can tell you for a fact that Tumblr helped a generation of frightened, isolated kids trying to figure out their sexual identity. Now Tumblr is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkprogress.org/far-right-content-survived-tumblr-purge-36635e6aba4b/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a sex-free haven for white nationalists and Nazis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Ann Powers wrote an essay called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/07.24.97/dirty-art-9730.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In Defense of Nasty Art&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; It took progressives to task for not defending rap music because it was &quot;obscene&quot; and sexually graphic. Powers puts it mildly when she states, &quot;Their apprehension makes the fight to preserve freedom of expression seem hollow.&quot; This is an old problem. So it's no surprise that the same websites forbidding, banning, and blocking &quot;sexually suggestive&quot; art content also claim to care about free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Facebook. Artnet &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.artnet.com/market/gray-market-facebook-art-censorship-1235822&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; last March that Facebook's brutal art censorship includes the &lt;em&gt;Venus of Willendorf&lt;/em&gt;, Gustave Courbet's &lt;em&gt;The Origin of the World&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;the banning of Gerhard Richter's blurred rendering of a nude descending a staircase, Evelyne Axell's pop art painting of a woman licking an ice cream cone, and Danish Modernist Edvard Eriksen's beloved, more than 100-year-old public sculpture &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erasure of erotic art, to me, represents a crisis point of culture, of democracy. Art effects the greatest change and empowerment when it's transgressive, scandalous, nude, erotic. Visibility matters. Art is where minds are opened, ideas challenged, viewpoints explored, where people who hate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/why-art-has-the-power-to-change-the-world/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have a chance to be changed&lt;/a&gt;, even if for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time the internet gave you hope?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can feel my anxiety climbing as I look for the voices of adult performers and sex workers online. The silence is so overwhelming it's suffocating. In 2018, an estimated 42 million sex workers worldwide were evicted from the open internet and essentially went into hiding with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/11/fosta-sesta-silencing-sex-workers/&quot;&gt;the passage of FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://survivorsagainstsesta.org/documentation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The censorship wave was unprecedented&lt;/a&gt; in internet history. Twitter, Facebook, and all major web service providers immediately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot;&gt;changed their rules&lt;/a&gt; to tightly police what was posted and messaged about sexual content, by anyone. Entire online communities were kicked off services like Cloudflare (55,000 users of Switter), and hundreds of thousands were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot;&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt; by the shuttering of safety forums and advertising-screening services. Reddit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/30/congress-just-legalized-sex-censorship-what-to-know/&quot;&gt;removed entire communities&lt;/a&gt; overnight. Recently, YouTube banned videos where people &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gy3gdb/youtube-banned-erica-lust-in-conversation-with-sex-workers&quot;&gt;simply talk to sex workers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices erased are the voices of women. Of gay and straight men, transgender people, the voices of people of color. These populations make up the majority of sex workers. So in America, FOSTA is analogous to how the World Health Organization is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/citizen-lab-netsweeper-internet-filtering-tech-censorship-1.4631243&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;categorized as &quot;pornography&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in web filters used in Kuwait and the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law &lt;a href=&quot;https://engadget.com/2018/03/30/congress-just-legalized-sex-censorship-what-to-know/&quot;&gt;legalized sex censorship online&lt;/a&gt;. FOSTA was pushed by Sheryl Sandberg and Facebook ‚Äî who used their support of FOSTA &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/blog/2018/11/15/how-facebook-sold-out-sex-workers/print&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to appease Sen. John Thune (R-South Dakota)&lt;/a&gt;. Thune pushes the false narrative that Facebook censors conservatives and previously said he wanted to regulate the company. FOSTA falsely states that consensual adult sex work is the same as sex trafficking, and was opposed by the Department of Justice, the ACLU, the EFF, numerous online free-speech organizations and actual sex-trafficking organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOSTA claimed to stop sex trafficking and has utterly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot;&gt;backfired&lt;/a&gt;. San Francisco just released its &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfranciscopolice.org/compstatreports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2018 crime statistics&lt;/a&gt;. The only violent crime that increased in San Francisco in 2018 was &quot;human trafficking&quot; ‚Äî up by an astonishing 170%. These are not sex-worker arrests, which fall under a &quot;vice&quot; subcategory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before FOSTA, the voices of sex workers were readily available. Anyone could ask sex workers who they are, why they make the choices they do and what actual sex workers think about doing sex work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an incredible moment because before free blogging and social-media sites, the only way we heard the voices of sex workers and porn performers was through media outlets that portrayed them as broken rape victims -- or sex-trafficked children. Adults having consensual sex for entertainment were not given a voice unless it validated a narrative of sin, of pain, of regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all the women (and LGBTQ, PoC) who could speak truth to any of this have been driven underground, silenced by algorithms, bans, and FOSTA-empowered &lt;a href=&quot;https://nowtoronto.com/news/sex-work-mens-rights-incel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4chan troll brigades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time you felt free on the internet?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Was6455164&quot; data-caption=&quot;starbucks&quot; data-credit=&quot;JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/GettyImages&quot; data-mep=&quot;3025067&quot; src=&quot;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-01%2Fb89d2390-24b4-11e9-9cfe-4115257ba1d3&amp;amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;amp;signature=e94206593d8c8fe0a28758d86632e0879493d794&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can feel my anxiety climbing as I type. Starbucks is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46393506&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;filtering&lt;/a&gt; its WiFi with a secret porn blacklist. &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ev8pg4/facebook-and-patreon-sex-educators-community-guidelines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/27/suicide-violence-and-going-underground-fosta-sesta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/02/paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry/&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook, Instagram, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/02/paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry/&quot;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt; will eject you for getting near a sex business, linking to perceived sex sites, letting the wrong people use your online business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/365330/new-facebook-policy-sparks-fears-of-sex-talk-crackdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned sexual slang&lt;/a&gt;; YouTube bans users for sex ed or LGBTQ content because it might be about sex; Twitter has &lt;a href=&quot;http://phonesexsecrets.info/2018/03/twitter-shadowbanning-aka-the-circles-of-hell.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a mysterious sex-shadowban that no one can get a straight answer on&lt;/a&gt;. Tumblr &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SexSchoolHub/status/1089176609792376834&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can't tell a potato from a boob&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://titsandsass.com/post-sesta-fosta-self-censoring-for-twitter-reddit-and-other-social-media/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guides on sexual self-censoring&lt;/a&gt; are popular ‚Äî and necessary. Google Drive &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scans your files and deletes what it believes to be explicit content&lt;/a&gt;. Apple just &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;straight-up hates sex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's critical at this harrowing juncture to understand that &lt;strong&gt;apps won, and the open internet lost&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2013, most users accessing the internet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-web-vs-app-usage-statistics-2014-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went to mobile&lt;/a&gt; and stayed that way. People don't actually browse the internet anymore, and we are in a free-speech nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Steve Jobs, adult and sex apps are super-banned from Apple's conservative walled garden. This, combined with Google's censorious push to purge its Play Store of sex has quietly, insidiously formed a censored duopoly controlled by two companies that make Morality in Media very, very happy. Facebook, even though technically a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;darknet&lt;/a&gt;, rounded it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Facebook's FOSTA-SESTA law should share credit for its success with Morality in Media (rebranded as &quot;National Center on Sexual Exploitation&quot;), which claimed the victory as well. Morality in Media was also behind Apple's massive &quot;sexy apps&quot; purge in 2010. And Google's 2014 AdWords sex ban was claimed by Morality In Media as a victorious outcome from their pressure and meetings with Google to crack down on porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was the last time you thought of the internet as a weird and wonderful place?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;woman&quot; data-caption=&quot;woman&quot; data-credit=&quot;PORNCHAI SODA via Getty Images&quot; data-credit-link-back=&quot;&quot; data-dam-provider=&quot;&quot; data-local-id=&quot;local-1-5845728-1548871892698&quot; data-media-id=&quot;bc441e75-56a5-4d32-acb3-94105293d829&quot; data-original-url=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-01/3f1c0a30-24ba-11e9-bff1-db3ccf593d86&quot; data-title=&quot;woman&quot; src=&quot;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-01%2F3f1c0a30-24ba-11e9-bff1-db3ccf593d86&amp;amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;amp;signature=ba909999763ce6856143a75c6c244bbee7c2c3c2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on the other side now. Like everyone I know, my anxiety climbs as I open any new browser window, check any app or news site. As corporations have scuttled the weird and the wonderful, the taboo voices and forbidden artwork, we wonder only ... what hate will we see today? What attacks await, now that the common rooms and public squares are the playgrounds of racist and anti-sex algorithms, of incels and Nazis, of advertisers and corporations ruling platforms with the iron fist of dated conservative values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is women, people of color, LGBTQ communities, writers and artists who compose the majority population of sex communities, it is everyone who pays the price. It is a curtailing of our freedoms, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who excised the erotic artists and photographers from Tumblr, who decided that sex talk on iTunes podcasts must not titillate, those who implement anti-sex language filters in anything ... they will pay for it, too. Just not in the ways we'd like (their pocketbooks, their conscience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They'll pay with a little piece of their soul when a young intersex girl can't find a healthy representation of pleasurable sexuality for her own body and decides that suicide is better than her oppressor's moralistic illusion of isolation. The ignorance behind the war on sex raged by the Facebooks, the Apples, the Googles, the advertisers, the algorithms, is not only dated, but dangerous. As women fight for control of our reproductive organs, as trans people fight for the right to use a bathroom, the trolls have convinced the gatekeepers that sex must be silent, and 4chan ‚Äî acting on the urges of right-wing populists ‚Äî deserves a voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what would've happened if the internet could've been allowed to continue without the war on sex. But I know it wouldn't be the terrible place of anxiety and fear we're in now.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Insurance Company Says NotPetya Is an ‚ÄúAct of War‚Äù, Refuses to Pay</title>
<link>https://ridethelightning.senseient.com/2019/01/insurance-company-says-notpetya-is-an-act-of-war-refuses-to-pay.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ridethelightning.senseient.com/2019/01/insurance-company-says-notpetya-is-an-act-of-war-refuses-to-pay.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I read a fascinating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/cyber-insurance-not-valid-in-case-of-cyber-war-says-major-insurance-company/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; from CPO Magazine and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/notpetya-an-act-of-war-cyber-insurance-firm-taken-to-task-for-refusing-to-pay-out/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; from ZDNet about the refusal of Zurich American Insurance Company to pay out a $100 million claim from consumer packaged goods company Mondelez, which was one of the biggest victims of the NotPetya ransomware attack in June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich's claim? The NotPetya attack was an act of cyber war and therefore not covered by the policy. Really? What a test case this will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mondelez, its cyber insurance policy with Zurich specifically covered ‚Äúall risks of physical loss or damage‚Äù and ‚Äúall risk of physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs or software‚Äù due to ‚Äúthe malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction.‚Äù One would think that the language in the cyber insurance policy was specifically designed to be broad enough to protect Mondelez in the event of any kind of cyber attack or hack. And NotPetya would seem to fit the definition included in the cyber insurance policy ‚Äì it was a bit of malicious code that effectively prevented Mondelez from getting its systems back up and running unless it paid out a hefty Bitcoin ransom to hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondelez totaled up all the damage that resulted from the NotPetya ransomware attack, filing a cyber risk insurance claim, coming up with the figure of $100 million as the total damages resulting from the loss of 1,700 servers and 24,000 laptops, as well as the loss of thousands of user credentials, unfilled orders and other related economic losses from the security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Zurich indicated that it might pay $10 million, or about 10 percent of the overall claim. But then Zurich stated that it wouldn't pay any of the claim by invoking a special ‚Äúcyber war‚Äù clause. According to Zurich, it is not responsible for any payment of the claim if NotPetya was actually ‚Äúa hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war.‚Äù According to Zurich, the NotPetya cyber attack originated with Russian hackers working directly with the Russian government to destabilize the Ukraine. This is what Zurich believes constitutes &quot;cyber war.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich American Insurance Company points to the official statements of national security officials from the UK, Canadian and Australian governments, all of which blamed Russia for the cyber attack in February 2018. Even the White House in the United States said the cyber attack was part of Kremlin efforts to destabilize the Ukrainian government. Moreover, all of these Western governments specifically noted that the first NotPetya attack occurred in Ukraine before spreading out around the world to impact companies like Mondelez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mondelez was outraged. Company executives called Zurich‚Äôs actions ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù and insurance industry insiders say that Zurich‚Äôs actions could set a ‚Äúnasty new precedent‚Äù about what cyber insurance covers. Many are now worried that any time there is a cyber attack or data breach, an insurance company offering cyber insurance can simply claim that it was due to an ‚Äúact of cyber war,‚Äù and reject the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden of proof falls on the insurance company. Zurich will have to prove that NotPetya was, indeed, an act of cyber war. That may be very difficult indeed. While intelligence agencies blamed Russia for the attacks, they provided no proof of an attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn‚Äôt just Mondelez that was left reeling by the cyber attack ‚Äì shipping giant Maersk projects that its total losses were close to $300 million, while global logistics giant FedEx says that its losses were also in the neighborhood of $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just imagine what would happen if the world‚Äôs top insurance companies are suddenly faced with the prospect of ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù events happening every few months. It has the potential to bring down the entire insurance industry, or at least, the cyberinsurance industry. Just as some insurers refuse insurance policies for homeowners located in the middle of hurricane or earthquake zones, they might start refusing to write cyberinsurance policies for large organizations that deal with personal data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the courts decide the policies mean? How will they define a &quot;cyber war?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from the consumer point of view, how much can you count on your cyber insurer to bail you out? Isn't that why you bought the insurance? Zurich's refusal to pay has met with a lot of backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Design Flaw Behind MacBook Pro‚Äôs ‚ÄúStage Light‚Äù Effect [video]</title>
<link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLALpD004Gk</link>
