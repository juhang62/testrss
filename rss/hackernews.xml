&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machines have raised the stakes once again. A superhuman poker-playing bot called Pluribus has beaten top human professionals at six-player no-limit Texas hold’em poker, the most popular variant of the game. It is the first time that an artificial-intelligence (AI) program has beaten elite human players at a game with more than two players&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02156-9#ref-CR1&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-action=&quot;anchor-link&quot; data-track-label=&quot;go to reference&quot; data-track-category=&quot;references&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While going from two to six players might seem incremental, it’s actually a big deal,” says Julian Togelius at New York University, who studies games and AI. “The multiplayer aspect is something that is not present at all in other games that are currently studied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind Pluribus had already built an AI, called Libratus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/how-rival-bots-battled-their-way-to-poker-supremacy-1.21580&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/how-rival-bots-battled-their-way-to-poker-supremacy-1.21580&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;that had beaten professionals at two-player poker&lt;/a&gt;. It built Pluribus by updating Libratus and created a bot that needs much less computing power to play matches. In a 12-day session with more than 10,000 hands, it beat 15 top human players. “A lot of AI researchers didn’t think it was possible to do this” with our techniques, says Noam Brown at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Facebook AI Research in New York, who developed Pluribus with his Carnegie colleague Tuomas Sandholm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/reboot-for-the-ai-revolution-1.22826&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-019-02156-9/d41586-019-02156-9_16408094.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other AIs that have mastered human games — such as Libratus and DeepMind’s Go-playing bots — have shown that they are unbeatable in two-player zero-sum matches. In these scenarios, there is always one winner and one loser, and game theory offers a well-defined best strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But game theory is less helpful for scenarios involving multiple parties with competing interests and no clear win–lose conditions — which reflect most real-life challenges. By solving multiplayer poker, Pluribus lays the foundation for future AIs to tackle complex problems of this sort, says Brown. He thinks that their success is a step towards applications such as automated negotiations, better fraud detection and self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra complex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle six-player poker, Brown and Sandholm radically overhauled Libratus’s search algorithm. Most game-playing AIs search forwards through decision trees for the best move to make in a given situation. Libratus searched to the end of a game before choosing an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the complexity introduced by extra players makes this tactic impractical. Poker requires reasoning with hidden information — players must work out a strategy by considering what cards their opponents might have and what opponents might guess about their hand based on previous betting. But more players makes choosing an action at any given moment more difficult, because it involves assessing a larger number of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key breakthrough was developing a method that allowed Pluribus to make good choices after looking ahead only a few moves rather than to the end of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;recommended pull pull--left sans-serif&quot; data-label=&quot;Related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00505-2&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;recommended article&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;recommended__image&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-019-02156-9/d41586-019-02156-9_16689732.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pluribus teaches itself from scratch using a form of reinforcement learning similar to that used by DeepMind’s Go AI, AlphaZero. It starts off playing poker randomly and improves as it works out which actions win more money. After each hand, it looks back at how it played and checks whether it would have made more money with different actions, such as raising rather than sticking to a bet. If the alternatives lead to better outcomes, it will be more likely to choose theme in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By playing trillions of hands of poker against itself, Pluribus created a basic strategy that it draws on in matches. At each decision point, it compares the state of the game with its blueprint and searches a few moves ahead to see how the action played out. It then decides whether it can improve on it. And because it taught itself to play without human input, the AI settled on a few strategies that human players tend not to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI playpen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pluribus’s success is largely down to its efficiency. When playing, it runs on just two central processing units (CPUs). By contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/google-ai-algorithm-masters-ancient-game-of-go-1.19234&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/google-ai-algorithm-masters-ancient-game-of-go-1.19234&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;DeepMind’s original Go bot used nearly 2,000 CPUs,&lt;/a&gt; and Libratus 100 CPUs, when they first beat top professionals. When playing against itself, Pluribus plays a hand in around 20 seconds — roughly twice as fast as professional humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games have proved a great way to measure progress in AI because bots can be scored against top humans — and objectively be hailed as superhuman if they triumph. But Brown thinks that AIs are outgrowing their playpen. “This was the last remaining challenge in poker,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Togelius thinks there is mileage yet for AI researchers and games. “There’s a lot of unexplored territory,” he says. Few AIs have mastered more than one game, which requires general ability rather than a niche skill. And there’s more than simply playing games, says Togelius. “There’s also designing them. A great AI challenge if there ever was one.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Data scientists shouldn&amp;#039;t use Upwork</title>
<link>https://www.racketracer.com/2019/07/11/why-data-scientists-should-never-use-upwork/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.racketracer.com/2019/07/11/why-data-scientists-should-never-use-upwork/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, I got an interesting request for a contract assignment on Upwork. An HR company called “FS consulting” tasked me with building an algorithm relating demographics to job performance. As a data scientist I was pretty intrigued because I had previously worked in the jobs industry, a start-up where I built candidate-job matching algorithms off of millions of data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I had also never used Upwork before. I had created an account a year ago when I had a month long gap between my last job and my current one and felt bored for some work. So I was surprised when I got this message out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.png?resize=781%2C318&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1325&quot; width=&quot;781&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.png?w=706&amp;amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.png?resize=300%2C122&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first task I ever received and it flickered my curiosity. In the problem set, the dataset contained survey and demographic attributes like race, age, computer proficiency, immigration status….etc.. to predict actual work performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on the dataset, built a model, and followed their instructions to send back the Python code and predictions in a CSV as deliverables to judge performance. Their offer was $80/hr for 5 hours of work and Upwork took a steep 20% cut so the payout was $64/hr at $400 dollars total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later I checked Upwork and saw that FS consulting disputed the contract job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png?resize=708%2C261&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1326&quot; width=&quot;708&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png?w=558&amp;amp;ssl=1 558w, https://i0.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked me to complete a survey at the end of the task that I had never seen or got an email about. Instead I had ended the task beforehand. It was a common misunderstanding and I wanted to resolve it immediately by finishing the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upwork however had given me a limited timeframe to actually respond to the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.png?resize=687%2C252&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1327&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height=&quot;252&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.png?w=538&amp;amp;ssl=1 538w, https://i1.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.png?resize=300%2C110&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given three days to respond over the July 4th weeked, I completed the survey which was asking me workplace situational questions testing my unconscious biases and then quickly rejected the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, I receive this email from Upwork customer success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-4.png?resize=744%2C243&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1328&quot; width=&quot;744&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-4.png?w=560&amp;amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-4.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you joking me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Upwork’s customer success team had actually reviewed the messages between the client and I, Upwork would have understood it was a misunderstanding. The client was completely fine with paying me after I had accidentally not filled out the ten minute survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I was penalized and had to refund the client all of the money from the contract because I literally did not follow their “correct way” to log my hours which did not guarantee me payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6.png?resize=705%2C103&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1330&quot; width=&quot;705&quot; height=&quot;103&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6.png?w=533&amp;amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i0.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-6.png?resize=300%2C44&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their rules state that you must have the Upwork Desktop App on you computer which installs some sort of video malware onto your laptop &lt;strong&gt;AND have your webcam visible and on at all times&lt;/strong&gt; so that the customer success agent can audit that you looked like you were working through the webcam while staring at a screen&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; How is that not the &lt;strong&gt;creepiest shit ever&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Upwork was competent in any way they would read the work messages instead of instantly finding manually logging as a violation of their rules. But Upwork guarantees that your hours are automatically refunded to the client if I didn’t respond to the dispute within three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-7.png?resize=650%2C113&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1331&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-7.png?w=529&amp;amp;ssl=1 529w, https://i2.wp.com/www.racketracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-7.png?resize=300%2C52&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me, as if Upwork will fail to consider any other alternative but to screw over the contractors given any failure into a set of terms and conditions you blindly agree to when you sign up. If this is the means to which data scientists and engineers should be getting contracts, then Upwork is already ripe for disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does Upwork, as a company, fail this badly in their job, and not realize the easy misunderstand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, maybe it’s because they eat their own dog food, and hire their own customer success agents over the platform, and then end up having to use their own product.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;France has approved a digital services tax despite threats of retaliation by the US, which argues that it unfairly targets American tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3% tax will be levied on sales generated in France by multinational firms like Google and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French government has argued that such firms headquartered outside the country pay little or no tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US administration has ordered an inquiry into the move - which could result in retaliatory tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tax was approved by the French senate on Thursday, a week after it was passed by the lower house, the National Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any digital company with revenue of more than €750m ($850m; £670m) - of which at least €25m is generated in France - would be subject to the levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be retroactively applied from early 2019, and is expected to raise about €400m this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

They declare most of their profits where they are headquartered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission estimates that on average traditional businesses face a 23% tax rate on their profits within the EU, while internet companies typically pay 8% or 9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France has long argued that taxes should be based on digital, not just physical presence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46591576&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;It announced its own tax on big technology firms&lt;/a&gt; last year after EU-wide efforts stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An EU levy would require consensus among members, but Ireland, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Finland raised objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France's new 3% tax will be based on sales made in the country, rather than on profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 30 companies will pay it - mostly US groups such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Chinese, German, Spanish and British firms are also affected, as well as the French online advertising firm Criteo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French government says the tax will end if a similar measure is agreed internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big tech companies have argued they are complying with national and international tax laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What has the US said?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration denounced the move a day before the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday trade representative Robert Lighthizer said an investigation would &quot;determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

It took the same view with China and has buried itself in a trade war that has destabilised relations and has the potential to escalate even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The digital tax is a risk for France, for it is now isolated. There had been talk of a Europe-wide tech tax, but talks fell down thanks in part to opposition from countries such as Ireland, which has benefited from being able to attract tech firms to set up their European base in the country. Other countries - such as the UK, Spain and Austria - are considering similar moves, but France is furthest along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing all sides agree on, however, is that in our modern, digital economy, the overhaul of how companies are taxed is long overdue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France will be hoping for one of two outcomes. Either countries follow their lead and implement their own, independent laws, limiting France's exposure. Or the move gives added energy to calls for a multilateral agreement on how digital firms should be taxed globally, putting an end to the squirreling-away of vast sums of money made by internet giants.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

<title>Malicious apps infect 25M Android devices with &amp;#039;Agent Smith&amp;#039; malware</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-gallery lightGallery&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;div data-thumb=&quot;https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/tmb/2019/malware.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/2019/malware.jpg&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;Credit: CC0 Public Domain&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/csz/news/800/2019/malware.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;malware&quot; title=&quot;Credit: CC0 Public Domain&quot;/&gt; Credit: CC0 Public Domain&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malicious apps from a campaign called &quot;Agent Smith&quot; have been downloaded to 25 million Android devices, according to new research by cyber-security firm Check Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;article-banner first-banner&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apps, most of them games, were distributed through third-party app stores by a Chinese group with a legitimate business helping Chinese developers promote their apps on outside platforms. Check Point is not identifying the company, because they are working with local law enforcement. About 300,000 devices were infected in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware was able to copy &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/popular+apps/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;popular apps&lt;/a&gt; on the phone, including WhatsApp and the web browser Opera, inject its own malicious code and replace the original app with the weaponized version, using a vulnerability in the way Google apps are updated. The hijacked apps would still work just fine, which hid the malware from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with all the permissions users had granted to the real apps, &quot;Agent Smith&quot; was able to hijack other apps on the phone to display unwanted ads to users. That might not seem like a significant problem, but the same security flaws could be used to hijack banking, shopping and other sensitive apps, according to Aviran Hazum, head of Check Point's analysis and response team for &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/mobile+devices/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hypothetically, nothing is stopping them from targeting bank apps, changing the functionality to send your bank credentials&quot; to a third party, Hazum said. &quot;The user wouldn't be able to see any difference, but the attacker could connect to your bank account remotely.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also had 11 apps in the official Google Play store with a &quot;dormant&quot; version of &quot;Agent Smith,&quot; which could have been triggered into action by a banner ad containing the keyword &quot;infect.&quot; The apps, which have been removed from the Google Play store, had been downloaded over 10 million times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important for users to understand that ads aren't always just ads, according to Dustin Childs, the communications manager for cybersecurity company Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, a so-called 'bug bounty' program that pays rewards to hackers and researchers who tip them off about software security flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've seen malicious ads that can install apps when you browse to a webpage from your Android device. They could be installing ransomware, they could be copying your contacts,&quot; he said, referring to prior research. &quot;Ad blockers aren't just to block ads.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Childs recommends Android users use ad blocker software, always update their devices when prompted, and only download apps from the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The app developer can do nothing to prevent this,&quot; said Hazum. &quot;The fix has to come from the operating system.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google already fixed at least one of the Android exploits used by &quot;Agent Smith,&quot; nicknamed Janus, in 2017 but the fix hasn't made its way onto every Android phone. It's a potent reminder that millions of phones around the world are being used without the latest security measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The sheer numbers infected by this campaign shows how many devices are not updated,&quot; Hazum said. &quot;It takes quite a lot of time for an update to reach every phone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of the problem is how fragmented the Android ecosystem is, especially compared to the iPhone ecosystem, Childs said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Google is very good about releasing fixes for the vulnerabilities they know about, but getting it to all the devices is a very difficult problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Google issues a new security fix, or &quot;patch,&quot; every device maker such as Samsung or LG  has make sure all their own apps still work with the new system, which can take time. Manufacturers usually stop offering security updates to phone models after a few years, or even a few months, a significant problem given how long people tend to keep smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If manufacturers push out an update for the device, all the carriers such as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T then have to authorize the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step, of course, is getting people to actually update their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People see they have an update and know it will take their &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/phone/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; 30 minutes to download it, apply it, and restart the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/device/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;device&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; Hazum said. &quot;A lot of people ignore it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not users have updated security on their phones, one of the biggest risks to Android devices comes from third-party app stores, which aren't well-vetted, said Daniel Thomas, a research associate and lecturer at University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas was part of a research team that found 87% of Android devices in 2015 were using out-of-date versions of the operating system. The team's Android Vulnerabilities program distributes data about historical and current risks for the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But iPhone users shouldn't get comfortable. Even though the Apple ecosystem is more controlled than Android, hackers have found plenty of ways to exploit devices using iOS, not to mention Apple is set to stop offering security updates to many iPhone models that are still widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In any large body of code, there will always be vulnerabilities we haven't found yet,&quot; Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Shopify and the Power of Platforms</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;While I am (rightfully) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexia/status/1146517806357155841&quot;&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; about how often I discuss &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/&quot;&gt;Aggregation Theory&lt;/a&gt;, there is a method to my madness, particularly over the last year: more and more attention is being paid to the power wielded by Aggregators like Google and Facebook, but to my mind the language is all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discussed this at length last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/&quot;&gt;Tech’s Two Philosophies&lt;/a&gt; highlighted how Facebook and Google want to do things for you; Microsoft and Apple were about helping you do things better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-moat-map/&quot;&gt;The Moat Map&lt;/a&gt; discussed the relationship between network effects and supplier differentiation: the more that network effects were internalized the more suppliers were commoditized, and the more that network effects were externalized the more suppliers were differentiated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/&quot;&gt;The Bill Gates Line&lt;/a&gt; formally defined the difference between Aggregators and Platforms. This is the key paragraph:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ultimately the most important distinction between platforms and Aggregators: platforms are powerful because they facilitate a relationship between 3rd-party suppliers and end users; Aggregators, on the other hand, intermediate and control it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It follows, then, that debates around companies like Google that use the word “platform” and, unsurprisingly, draw comparisons to Microsoft twenty years ago, misunderstand what is happening and, inevitably, result in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/&quot;&gt;prescriptions that would exacerbate problems that exist&lt;/a&gt; instead of solving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, though, another reason to understand the difference between platforms and Aggregators: platforms are Aggregators’ most effective competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amazon’s Bifurcation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/3/18716431/walmart-jet-marc-lore-modcloth-amazon-ecommerce-losses-online-sales&quot;&gt;I wrote about Walmart’s failure to compete with Amazon head-on&lt;/a&gt;; after years of trying to leverage its stores in e-commerce, Walmart realized that Amazon was winning because e-commerce required a fundamentally different value chain than retail stores. The point of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/walmarts-e-commerce-struggles-textbook-disruption-the-benefits-of-not-competing/&quot;&gt;Daily Update&lt;/a&gt; was that the proper response to that recognition was not to try to imitate Amazon, but rather to focus on areas where the stores actually were an advantage, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/the-value-chain-constraint/&quot;&gt;like groceries&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s worth understanding exactly why attacking Amazon head-on was a losing proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Amazon started, the company followed a traditional retail model, just online. That is, Amazon bought products at wholesale, then sold them to customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon retail sits between suppliers and customers&quot; width=&quot;977&quot; height=&quot;251&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4279&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6.jpeg 977w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6-300x77.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6-768x197.jpeg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s sales proceeded to grow rapidly, not just of books, but also in other media products with large selections like DVDs and CDs that benefitted from Amazon’s effectively unlimited shelf-space. This growth allowed Amazon to build out its fulfillment network, and by 1999 the company had seven fulfillment centers across the U.S. and three more in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten may not seem like a lot — Amazon has well over 300 fulfillment centers today, plus many more distribution and sortation centers — but for reference Walmart has only 20. In other words, at least when it came to fulfillment centers, Amazon was halfway to Walmart’s current scale 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would ultimately take Amazon another nine years to reach twenty fulfillment centers (this was the time for Walmart to respond), but in the meantime came a critical announcement that changed what those fulfillment centers represented. In 2006 Amazon announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm&quot;&gt;Fulfillment by Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, wherein 3rd-party merchants could use those fulfillment centers too. Their products would not only be listed on Amazon.com, they would also be held, packaged, and shipped by Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Amazon.com effectively bifurcated itself into a retail unit and a fulfillment unit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon bifurcated itself into retail and fulfillment units&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4278&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5-300x155.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5-768x396.jpeg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old value chain is still there — nearly half of the products on Amazon.com are still bought by Amazon at wholesale and sold to customers — but 3rd parties can sell directly to consumers as well, bypassing Amazon’s retail arm and leveraging only Amazon’s fulfillment arm, which was growing rapidly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon Fulfillment Centers Over Time&quot; width=&quot;1424&quot; height=&quot;790&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4284&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM.png 1424w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-300x166.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-768x426.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-1024x568.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-1136x630.png 1136w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart and its 20 distribution centers don’t stand a chance, particularly since catching up means competing for consumers not only with Amazon but with all of those 3rd-party merchants filling up all of those fulfillment centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amazon and Aggregation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one more critical part of the drawing I made above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon owns all customer interactions&quot; width=&quot;975&quot; height=&quot;688&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4280&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4.jpeg 975w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4-300x212.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4-768x542.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4-893x630.jpeg 893w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that Amazon had effectively split itself in two in order to incorporate 3rd-party merchants, this division is barely noticeable to customers. They still go to Amazon.com, they still use the same shopping cart, they still get the boxes with the smile logo. Basically, Amazon has managed to incorporate 3rd-party merchants while still owning the entire experience from an end-user perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should sound familiar: as I noted at the top, Aggregators tend to internalize their network effects and commoditize their suppliers, which is exactly what Amazon has done.&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/#footnote_0_4277&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_4277&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;While Amazon is not technically an Aggregator — the company deals with physical goods that absolutely have both marginal and transaction costs — one way to understand the company’s dominance is that its massive investments in logistics have driven those costs much lower than its competitors, allowing the company to reap many of the same benefits.&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; Amazon benefits from more 3rd-party merchants being on its platform because it can offer more products to consumers and justify the buildout of that extensive fulfillment network; 3rd-party merchants are mostly reduced to competing on price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, suggests there is a platform alternative — that is, a company that succeeds by enabling its suppliers to differentiate and externalizing network effects to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem. That alternative is Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Shopify Platform&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, Shopify isn’t an Amazon competitor at all: after all, there is nothing to buy on Shopify.com. And yet, there were 218 million people that bought products from Shopify without even knowing the company existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is that Shopify is a platform: instead of interfacing with customers directly, 820,000 3rd-party merchants sit on top of Shopify and are responsible for acquiring all of those customers on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Merchants interact with customers, not Shopify&quot; width=&quot;990&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4281&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg 990w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3-300x207.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3-768x530.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3-913x630.jpeg 913w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means they have to stand out not in a search result on Amazon.com, or simply offer the lowest price, but rather earn customers’ attention through differentiated product, social media advertising, etc. Many, to be sure, will fail at this: Shopify does not break out merchant churn specifically, but it is almost certainly extremely high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, is the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Walmart, currently weighing whether to spend additional billions after the billions it has already spent trying to attack Amazon head-on, with a binary outcome of success or failure, Shopify is massively diversified. That is the beauty of being a platform: you succeed (or fail) in the aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I would argue that for Shopify a high churn rate is just as much a positive signal as it is a negative one: the easier it is to start an e-commerce business on the platform, the more failures there will be. And, at the same time, the greater likelihood there will be of capturing and supporting successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how Shopify can both in the long run be the biggest competitor to Amazon even as it is a company that Amazon can’t compete with: Amazon is pursuing customers and bringing suppliers and merchants onto its platform on its own terms; Shopify is giving merchants an opportunity to differentiate themselves while bearing no risk if they fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Shopify Fulfillment Network&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the context for one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRRwW8fiHUY&amp;amp;list=PLvQF73bM4-5XoGEPnerBbkIef1egtD1x9&amp;amp;index=8&amp;amp;t=0s&quot;&gt;the most interesting announcements&lt;/a&gt; from Shopify’s recent partner conference, Shopify Unite. The name should ring familiar: the Shopify &lt;em&gt;Fulfillment&lt;/em&gt; Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/unite-2019#5&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers want their online purchases fast, with free shipping. It’s now expected, thanks to the recent standard set by the largest companies in the world. Working with third-party logistics companies can be tedious. And finding a partner that won’t obscure your customer data or hide your brand with packaging is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we’re building Shopify Fulfillment Network—a geographically dispersed network of fulfillment centers with smart inventory-allocation technology. We use machine learning to predict the best places to store and ship your products, so they can get to your customers as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve negotiated low rates with a growing network of warehouse and logistic providers, and then passed on those savings to you. We support multiple channels, custom packaging and branding, and returns and exchanges. And it’s all managed in Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first paragraph explains why the Shopify Fulfillment Network was a necessary step for Shopify: Amazon may commoditize suppliers, hiding their brand from website to box, but if its offering is truly superior, suppliers don’t have much choice. That was increasingly the case with regards to fulfillment, particularly for the small-scale sellers that are important to Shopify not necessarily for short-term revenue generation but for long-run upside. Amazon was simply easier for merchants and more reliable for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice, though, that Shopify is not doing everything on their own: there is an entire world of third-party logistics companies (known as “3PLs”) that offer warehousing and shipping services. What Shopify is doing is what platforms do best: act as an interface between two modularized pieces of a value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Shopify as interface between 3PLs and merchants&quot; width=&quot;985&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4283&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg 985w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1-768x405.jpeg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side are all of Shopify’s hundreds of thousands of merchants: interfacing with all of them on an individual basis is not scalable for those 3PL companies; now, though, they only need to interface with Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same benefit applies in the opposite direction: merchants don’t have the means to negotiate with multiple 3PLs such that their inventory is optimally placed to offer fast and inexpensive delivery to customers; worse, the small-scale sellers I discussed above often can’t even get an audience with these logistics companies. Now, though, Shopify customers need only interface with Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Plaforms Versus Aggregators&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this is what Shopify has already accomplished when it comes to referral partners (who drive new merchants onto the platform), developers (who build apps for managing Shopify stores) and theme designers (who sell themes to customize the look-and-feel of stores). COO Harley Finkelstein &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HD4uGlS1SM&amp;amp;list=PLvQF73bM4-5XoGEPnerBbkIef1egtD1x9&amp;amp;index=8&quot;&gt;said at Unite&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve often heard me say that we at Shopify want to create more value for your partners than we capture for ourselves, and I find the best way to demonstrate this is by looking at what I call the “Partner Economy”. The “Partner Economy” is the amount of revenue that flows to all of you our partners…in 2018 Shopify made about a billion dollars [&lt;em&gt;Editor: in revenue&lt;/em&gt;]. We estimate that you, our partners, made more than $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Shopify clears the &lt;em&gt;Bill Gates Line&lt;/em&gt; — it captures a minority of the value in the ecosystem it has created — and the Shopify Fulfillment Network should fit right in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The Shopify platform&quot; width=&quot;973&quot; height=&quot;736&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4282&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg 973w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-300x227.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-768x581.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-833x630.jpeg 833w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is powerful about this model is that it leverages the best parts of modularity — diversity and competition at different parts of the value chain — and aligns the incentives of all of them. Every referral partner, developer, theme designer, and now 3PL provider is simultaneously incentivized to compete with each other narrowly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ensure that Shopify succeeds broadly, because that means the pie is bigger for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only way to take on an integrated Aggregator like Amazon: trying to replicate what Amazon has built up over decades, as Walmart has attempted, is madness. Amazon has the advantage in every part of the stack, from more customers to more suppliers to lower fulfillment costs to faster delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way out of that competition is differentiation; granted, Walmart has tried buying and launching new brands exclusive to its store, but differentiation when it comes to e-commerce goods doesn’t arise from top down planning. Rather, it bubbles up from widespread opportunity (and churn!), like that created by Shopify, supported by an entire aligned ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;footnote_0_4277&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;While Amazon is not technically an Aggregator — the company deals with physical goods that absolutely have both marginal and transaction costs — one way to understand the company’s dominance is that its massive investments in logistics have driven those costs much lower than its competitors, allowing the company to reap many of the same benefits.

<og:title>Shopify and the Power of Platforms</og:title>

<og:description>It is all but impossible to beat an Aggregator head-on, as Walmart is trying to do with Amazon. The solution instead is to build a platform like Shopify.</og:description>

<title>QuickJS JavaScript Engine</title>
<link>https://bellard.org/quickjs/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bellard.org/quickjs/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;QuickJS Javascript Engine&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;52.250857796416&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2019-07-09:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First public release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QuickJS is a small and embeddable Javascript engine. It supports the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/&quot;&gt;ES2019 specification&lt;/a&gt; including modules, asynchronous generators and proxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It optionally supports mathematical extensions such as big integers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.github.io/proposal-bigint/&quot;&gt;BigInt&lt;/a&gt;), big floating point numbers (BigFloat) and operator overloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main Features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small and easily embeddable: just a few C files, no external dependency, 190 KiB of x86 code for a simple &lt;tt&gt;hello world&lt;/tt&gt; program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast interpreter with very low startup time: runs the 56000 tests of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/test262&quot;&gt;ECMAScript Test Suite&lt;/a&gt; in about 100 seconds on a single core of a desktop PC. The complete life cycle of a runtime instance completes in less than 300 microseconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/&quot;&gt;ES2019&lt;/a&gt; support including modules, asynchronous generators and full Annex B support (legacy web compatibility).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passes 100% of the ECMAScript Test Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can compile Javascript sources to executables with no external dependency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garbage collection using reference counting (to reduce memory usage and have deterministic behavior) with cycle removal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematical extensions: BigInt, BigFloat, operator overloading, bigint mode, math mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command line interpreter with contextual colorization implemented in Javascript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small built-in standard library with C library wrappers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An online demonstration of the QuickJS engine with its mathematical extensions is available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://numcalc.com&quot;&gt;numcalc.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was compiled from C to WASM/asm.js with Emscripten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QuickJS documentation: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html&quot;&gt;HTML version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specification of the JS Bignum Extensions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/quickjs/jsbignum.html&quot;&gt;HTML version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bellard.org/quickjs/jsbignum.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple disables Walkie Talkie app due to eavesdropping vulnerability</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has disabled the Apple Watch Walkie Talkie app due to an unspecified vulnerability that could allow a person to listen to another customer’s iPhone without consent, the company told TechCrunch this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Apple has apologized for the bug and for the inconvenience of being unable to use the feature while a fix is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Op_I_dKS_k&quot;&gt;Walkie Talkie app on Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; allows two users who have accepted an invite from each other to receive audio chats via a “push to talk” interface reminiscent of the PTT buttons on older cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;A statement from Apple reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We were just made aware of a vulnerability related to the Walkie-Talkie app on the Apple Watch and have disabled the function as we quickly fix the issue. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and will restore the functionality as soon as possible. Although we are not aware of any use of the vulnerability against a customer and specific conditions and sequences of events are required to exploit it, we take the security and privacy of our customers extremely seriously. We concluded that disabling the app was the right course of action as this bug could allow someone to listen through another customer’s iPhone without consent.&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; We apologize again for this issue and the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Apple was alerted to the bug via its &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201220&quot;&gt;report a vulnerability portal&lt;/a&gt; directly and says there is no current evidence that it was exploited in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The company is temporarily disabling the feature entirely until a fix can be made and rolled out to devices. The Walkie Talkie App will remain installed on devices, but will not function until it has been updated with the fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Earlier this year a bug was &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/nasty-facetime-bug-could-allows-others-to-eavesdrop-on-your-microphone-or-camera/&quot;&gt;discovered in the group calling feature&lt;/a&gt; of FaceTime that allowed people to listen in before a call was accepted. It turned out that the teen who discovered the bug, Grant Thompson, had attempted to contact Apple about the issue but was unable to get a response. Apple fixed the bug and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47169462&quot;&gt;eventually rewarded&lt;/a&gt; Thompson a bug bounty. This time around, Apple appears to be listening more closely to the reports that come in via its vulnerability tips line and has disabled the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Earlier today, Apple quietly &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/&quot;&gt;pushed a Mac update&lt;/a&gt; to remove a feature of the Zoom conference app that allowed it to work around Mac restrictions to provide a smoother call initiation experience — but that also allowed emails and websites to add a user to an active video call without their permission.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Japan&amp;#039;s Hayabusa2 probe makes second touchdown on distant asteroid</title>
<link>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/07/11/national/science-health/japans-hayabusa2-probe-makes-second-touchdown-distant-asteroid/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/07/11/national/science-health/japans-hayabusa2-probe-makes-second-touchdown-distant-asteroid/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Hayabusa2 probe made a “perfect” touchdown Thursday on a distant asteroid and collected samples from beneath the surface in an unprecedented mission that could shed light on the origins of the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve collected a part of the solar system’s history,” Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) project manager Yuichi Tsuda said at a jubilant news conference in Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture, hours after the successful landing was confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“We have never gathered subsurface material from a celestial body further away than the moon,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did it and we succeeded in a world first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fridge-sized probe made its second landing on the asteroid around 10:30 a.m., with officials from JAXA breaking into applause and cheers at the mission control room in Sagamihara as initial data suggested the touchdown had been a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation of the landing came only after Hayabusa2 lifted back up from the asteroid and resumed communications with the control room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Director Takashi Kubota told reporters that the touchdown operation was “more than perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Tsuda, with a grin, said he rated it “1,000 points out of 100.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The probe moved perfectly and the team’s preparation work was perfect,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the collection of samples, the probe’s mission is almost complete, and it will start its journey back to Earth at the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are only at the stage of getting hold of (the samples) and we have to operate (the probe) carefully in order to bring them back,” Tsuda said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayabusa2 touched down on its targeted area measuring 7 meters in width, located 20 meters from the artificial crater’s center. The probe extended a tube to the surface and fired a small metallic projectile from it, successfully capturing the subsurface debris as it floated up, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief landing Thursday was the second time Hayabusa2 has touched down on the asteroid, which is about 300 million kilometers from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex multiyear mission has also involved sending rovers and robots down to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryugu’s surface has weathered due to the impact of solar winds but the subsurface samples are believed to have materials that can be traced to when the solar system was born some 4.6 billion years ago. These dark-colored samples may possibly contain organic materials and water, according to JAXA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayabusa2’s first touchdown was in February, when it landed briefly on Ryugu and fired a bullet into the surface to puff up dust for collection, before blasting back to its holding position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second touchdown required special preparations because any problems could mean the loss of the precious materials already gathered during its first landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As JAXA officials confirmed the probe’s landing, some 200 people also cheered at nearby Sagamihara City Museum while watching a live broadcast from the control room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some shouted “Congratulations” as they snapped photographs and took videos of the screen showing the control room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want the rock samples to be safely brought to Japan,” said Jyutaro Haga, an 11-year-old who lives in Myanmar but returned to Japan during the summer holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am filled with deep emotion. This project was the first in the world and I was very nervous, but I am happy that the touchdown was successful,” said a 48-year-old woman from Sagamihara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hayabusa2 mission has also attracted international attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May sent a video to the probe’s team ahead of the landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is watching. We love you, take care Hayabusa2,” the iconic musician told the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the size of a large refrigerator and equipped with solar panels to keep it powered, Hayabusa2 is the successor to JAXA’s first asteroid explorer, Hayabusa, which is Japanese for falcon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That probe returned with dust samples from a smaller, potato-shaped asteroid in 2010, despite various setbacks during its epic seven-year odyssey. It was hailed as a scientific triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hayabusa2’s photos of Ryugu, which means “dragon palace” in Japanese and refers to a castle at the bottom of the ocean in an ancient Japanese tale, show the asteroid has a rough surface full of boulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hayabusa2 mission was launched in December 2014, and has a price tag of around ¥30 billion. The probe is scheduled to return to Earth with its samples in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its has already made history, including with the creation of the crater on Ryugu’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005, NASA’s Deep Impact project succeeded in creating an artificial crater on a comet but only for observation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0f6f&quot; id=&quot;0f6f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Small podcasts can make real money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3d78&quot; id=&quot;3d78&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disruptingjapan.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.disruptingjapan.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Disrupting Japan&lt;/a&gt; podcast. Like many podcasts, the show dives deep into a small niche. It has no real hope of mass-market appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b663&quot; id=&quot;b663&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It turns out that if you want to make a living from a small podcast, its best to ignore most conventional advice. At least, that’s what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1690&quot; id=&quot;1690&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But before I explain, let me back up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e72f&quot; id=&quot;e72f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Podcast Nation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4b4&quot; id=&quot;f4b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Japan is not a podcasting nation. Most popular podcasts are recycled radio produced by major media companies. Good independent shows exist, but you need to look for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd6e&quot; id=&quot;fd6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve built a few startups in Japan, and the podcast was supposed to be me just talking with my founder friends about startups and innovation in Japan; about what it’s like to be an innovator in a culture that prizes conformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8db0&quot; id=&quot;8db0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I christened the show Disrupting Japan, and launched to decidedly little fanfare in September 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c259&quot; id=&quot;c259&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The podcast totaled 42 downloads that month. I thought that was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0636&quot; id=&quot;0636&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How Not to Grow a Podcast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d30c&quot; id=&quot;d30c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;My audience rose steadily each month, and after six months I had about 400 listeners. At this point, I decided to invest in growing my show, but most of the common sense marketing and production approaches I tried either had no effect or actually backfired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;28b2&quot; id=&quot;28b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I rented a studio to improve production quality, but it made my guests uncomfortable. Most simply could not relax in the unfamiliar environment and spent the whole interview looking at their mic rather than at me. I tried this with three different guests and didn’t get a single usable conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2eec&quot; id=&quot;2eec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s obvious in retrospect, but few things make people more nervous than shoving a microphone in their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;02e7&quot; id=&quot;02e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So I gave up on the studio. I started going to their offices and using a pair of small lapel mics. The sound quality was lower, but after a few seconds, my guests forgot they were wearing these little microphones and we could talk like two human beings. Showing up with a couple of beers also helped my guests relax and made the recording less if an interview and more of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;331d&quot; id=&quot;331d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It turned out that sacrificing a bit of production quality and so-called “professionalism” for a more personal, honest conversation was one of the best decisions I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;712d&quot; id=&quot;712d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Marketing my show proved counter-intuitive as well. None of the “foolproof techniques” everyone uses worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cd48&quot; id=&quot;cd48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve had good results using social media advertising for some of my startups, but it was worthless for podcasting. I poured money into multiple campaign strategies on Facebook and Twitter, but I saw no real increase in listeners. These platforms reported lots of “engagement” with my ads, but whatever form that engagement took, there was no significant difference in site visits or downloads between the episodes I advertised and those I did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;06a6&quot; id=&quot;06a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Appearing on other podcasts is also supposed to be a great way to grow an audience, but it didn’t work for me. I really enjoy the conversations I’ve had with other podcast hosts, but my appearances never resulted in a noticeable bump in listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7feb&quot; id=&quot;7feb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The other problem I ran into here, was that most of these podcast appearances are expected to be reciprocal. I’ll go on their show and tell my story, they’ll come on mine and give theirs. Well, the obvious problem here is that Disrupting Japan is a show about startups and innovation in Japan, and if you don’t have meaningful experience in that area, it doesn’t really make sense to bring you on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ff63&quot; id=&quot;ff63&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Most of the podcast hosts said they understood and polity withdrew their request to have me on their show. Two were clearly irritated and insisted that since their listenership was significantly larger than mine, I should be grateful that they were even giving me this opportunity. And of course, a few said they didn’t care and just wanted me to share my thoughts with their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c498&quot; id=&quot;c498&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I appeared on all of those shows. I enjoyed it. I had some good conversations, but these appearances didn’t really impact my download numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34b1&quot; id=&quot;34b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, these techniques do work for a lot of podcasters, and if you are starting a podcast, they may work for you and are certainly worth trying. But they clearly were not working for me, and I finally realized why. Disrupting Japan was addressing a very small niche — innovation and startups in Japan — and there were simply not enough existing podcast listeners interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f93f&quot; id=&quot;f93f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I would have to build an audience from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7ec1&quot; id=&quot;7ec1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So what really worked? At least for me.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;626d&quot; id=&quot;626d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The most effective way I found to grow my audience with was via interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;90f5&quot; id=&quot;90f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Online, this meant finding the handful of Facebook and LinkedIn groups interested in Japanese startups and then joining the discussions. Most groups welcomed my contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1dd7&quot; id=&quot;1dd7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, it was my offline efforts that made the biggest impact. I sought out any event or seminar where I could speak about Japanese startups and innovation. Every time I spoke, I saw a small uptick in listeners and email subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;15e6&quot; id=&quot;15e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That email list turned out to be more important than I expected for two reasons. First, casual surveys indicated that about 25% of Disrupting Japan fans were not subscribing to the podcast, but going to the site and listening from the browser or simply reading the transcript. Second, people seem far more willing to engage over email. Even today, when an episode is released, one or two people may comment on the site, but around 20 will reply to the email announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6e8&quot; id=&quot;d6e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Disrupting Japan fans were, and still are, extremely engaged. Most guests tell me that they receive a lot of positive feedback about their appearance. September of 2015 was the show’s first anniversary, and 120 Disrupting Japan fans paid a $20 cover charge to watch a live podcast and to meet and hang out with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;615f&quot; id=&quot;615f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Things were going well for the show, but I still viewed it as a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bfd8&quot; id=&quot;bfd8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In May 2016, the startup I was building blew up. At that point Disrupting Japan had about 3,500 listeners. Three friends urged me to try podcasting for a living. I had no better options, so I gave it a try and wound up becoming Japan’s first professional podcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;a8d8&quot; id=&quot;a8d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;God Help Me. I’m a Media Company!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5656&quot; id=&quot;5656&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;My first problem was that there were no ad agencies serving podcasters and no sponsors who understood the medium. There was a lot of work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;70eb&quot; id=&quot;70eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Disrupting Japan audience consists of startup founders, aspiring founders, and others interested in innovation in Japan. That’s an important and influential group of people. So I sat down and brainstormed what kinds of companies really wanted to connect to this audience. What specific companies really needed to reach Disrupting Japan listeners, and who I would feel good about recommending. After a week, I had a list of 50 likely sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;58ce&quot; id=&quot;58ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Of course, almost none of these companies had ever heard of me or of podcasts, but that could be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84c7&quot; id=&quot;84c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I began sending emails, making phone calls, knocking on doors and pitching in Powerpoint. It was tedious, but the feedback from potential sponsors was invaluable in crafting my final sponsorship package. It turned out that my sponsors didn’t really want what I thought I was selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a001&quot; id=&quot;a001&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Direct response advertising, where every click and impression is measured, dominates podcasting in America, but it’s a losing game for most podcasters. The industry focuses on CPM rates (the rate advertisers pay per thousand listens) because that metric is easy to standardize and measure, but with standardization comes commodification. If you ever buy into the idea that you are simply selling impressions or downloads, you resign yourself to competing with a nearly infinite number of other podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bb7&quot; id=&quot;2bb7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is a terrible situation to be in. Because there are a limited number of advertising dollars but an almost infinite supply of podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;31f3&quot; id=&quot;31f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The secret to making real money with a small podcast is helping companies build their brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1f69&quot; id=&quot;1f69&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With this in mind, I crafted sponsorship packages that combined podcast ads, banner ads, and in-person appearances at my sponsors’ events. These in-person appearances required a significant time commitment, but these live appearances both consistently drew people to the events and brought new listeners to Disrupting Japan. A virtuous cycle was set in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2815&quot; id=&quot;2815&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, I have some advice for any aspiring podcasters who are thinking of going this route. You need to be prepared to spend at least as much time with your sponsors as you do on your podcast. Writing and re-writing ad copy, explaining metrics, brainstorming messaging, and creating custom presentations for your sponsor’s events will place huge demands on your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c7d4&quot; id=&quot;c7d4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a97c&quot; id=&quot;a97c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Podcast advertising companies like Midroll and PodGrid are great, and it’s tempting to just let someone else bring sponsors to you. However, you give up a lot when you make that decision. In the end, your sponsorship and advertising rates are directly proportional to the effort you are willing to put into finding the right sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6443&quot; id=&quot;6443&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Nine months after going pro, I had an amazing group of sponsors and about 4,000 listeners. I was releasing an episode each week, with three ads per show at $680 per insertion, and earning a bit of additional revenue selling banner ads. I was earning well over $8,000 a month, and since I was still a one-man show with minimal advertising costs, this was mostly profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c6d&quot; id=&quot;7c6d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Disrupting Japan had become financially successful, but I was spending 70% of my time finding and working with sponsors and only 30% of my time creating the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8492&quot; id=&quot;8492&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And then it hit me. “God help me. I’m running a media company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9c7c&quot; id=&quot;9c7c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As far as media companies go, Disrupting Japan was at an awkward size. It wasn’t generating enough revenue to let me hire someone to handle the advertising and the business side, so the logical step seemed to be to start selling ads for other podcasts. This would increase the amount of revenue coming in and give me the cash flow I would need to bring together a real team to grow the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2c63&quot; id=&quot;2c63&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bootstrapping this podcast advertising venture was pretty simple. I went down iTunes’ list of the top 200 podcasts in Japan, crossed out the ones that were produced by major media companies, and then emailed the remaining podcasters. I introduced myself, explained that I had been selling ads on Disrupting Japan and asked if they were interested in sponsorship. Most of them were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7e6e&quot; id=&quot;7e6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Finding sponsors wasn’t difficult either, but I found couldn’t command the high rates that I could when selling ads on my own show. Sponsors paid an average of $42 CPM, and I kept 30% as commission. Both the sponsors and the podcasters seemed happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d8f&quot; id=&quot;1d8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I pitched Dentsu and a few other larges ad agencies on podcast sponsorship, and several had clients they felt would be interested in experimenting. Unfortunately, to make financial sense, even on an experimental level, these companies would need to sell at least $100,000 in podcast advertising per month, and there was nowhere near enough podcast inventory in Japan for advertising at that scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59c8&quot; id=&quot;59c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But I had a plan to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;00cd&quot; id=&quot;00cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Podcasting may not be big in Japan, but YouTube is huge. I was confident that with a bit of training and the promise of a 10x increase in their CPM rates, I could convince a number of high-profile YouTubers to take up podcasting on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8616&quot; id=&quot;8616&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was pretty busy at this point. I was interviewing potential co-founders and sales staff to help get this podcasting empire off the ground, and I was, of course, podcasting. I still had a weekly show to put out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f7d5&quot; id=&quot;f7d5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And here, our story reaches its anti-climax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5362&quot; id=&quot;5362&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Looking at this podcast advertising business in startup terms; I had good product-market fit and a path towards scalability. At this point, the startup narrative practically demands that I bring together a fanatically dedicated team to pursue the vision and fast-track the company towards IPO or acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5779&quot; id=&quot;5779&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But that didn’t happen. It could have happened. Perhaps it should have happened. But it didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da5e&quot; id=&quot;da5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was working 80-hour weeks. I was making progress, but I wasn’t finding anyone who really shared my vision of what podcasting could become in Japan. Frankly, I was burning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;35c3&quot; id=&quot;35c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It was right at this time when TEPCO Japan’s largest electric utility asked me to help them set up their innovation and startup investment program. It seemed like interesting work, and it paid a lot better than podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3bce&quot; id=&quot;3bce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I took the job and walked away from podcast advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0737&quot; id=&quot;0737&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Wait! What?!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b0a6&quot; id=&quot;b0a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Yeah, I know. That was not the ending you expected, but it actually is a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b315&quot; id=&quot;b315&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From a startup perspective, my decision may look like selling out, but from a podcasting perspective, it is exactly the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ac40&quot; id=&quot;ac40&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My podcast advertising empire was a failure, but my podcast is a success. Disrupting Japan has been ad-free for over a year, and it slowly and steadily continues to gain listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ffd&quot; id=&quot;5ffd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;People still occasionally tell me Disrupting Japan was what turned them onto podcasting, and so far four Japanese founders have told me that listening to the guests on my show is what gave them the courage to start their own startups. That means a lot to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c29a&quot; id=&quot;c29a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our fourth-anniversary show had 230 people show up. Once in a while a see a Disrupting Japan sticker on a random laptop or two in a co-working space I’m visiting, and it makes my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5835&quot; id=&quot;5835&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But I’m not really a podcaster. And many of the other independent voices in podcasting aren’t really podcasters either. We are people who create podcasts, and that difference is important. Our medium is not our message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5e1d&quot; id=&quot;5e1d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Even when I was a full-time podcaster, my podcast did not define me. None of my sponsors were really paying for ad space on the podcast. What they were really paying for was a chance to deliver a sincere message to a community they could not reach any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;90ca&quot; id=&quot;90ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Podcasting lets me tell stories that cannot be told in any other medium. It let me create a community that would not have formed around video or print. Podcasting has been financially rewarding and an amazing tool for networking and building a personal brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb36&quot; id=&quot;eb36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All the benefits you hear about podcasting are absolutely true, but there is also something I never expected going into this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0195&quot; id=&quot;0195&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Podcasting made me a better person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dfc6&quot; id=&quot;dfc6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I discovered that Interviewing people is easy, but having a meaningful conversation? That’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a98&quot; id=&quot;8a98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s hard to get people to go off-script — particularly if they are not media-trained and are not speaking in their native language. I wanted people to open up about what really worries them and to talk about the problems that keep them up at night. But that takes a level of empathy and sincerity that I simply didn’t have when I started this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b7dd&quot; id=&quot;b7dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Ironically, it turned out that the best way to get people out of their comfort zone is, for lack of a better term, being comfortable outside my own comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fbe4&quot; id=&quot;fbe4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everyone is happy to give abstract advice and recite clever anecdotes, but I found that if I wanted people to open up and be honest with me, I had to go first. Being an objective, detached observer simply didn’t work. Only when I shared my own hopes and fears and insecurities, where others were willing the share theirs with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a2ff&quot; id=&quot;a2ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I discovered this was true not only in podcasting but personally as well. Every time I pushed myself to talk candidly about something that made me uncomfortable, whether it was the search for my birth parents or the catastrophic failure of a recent startup, I was rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;622e&quot; id=&quot;622e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Every time, the stream of support was overwhelming. Every time I shared something real, people contacted me to let me know they were in — or had been in — the same place. A lot of people told me that it made them feel a bit better just to hear someone else talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0d20&quot; id=&quot;0d20&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Podcasting changed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bb90&quot; id=&quot;bb90&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I listen more and talk less than I used to. At parties, I find myself subconsciously slipping into interview mode, and people I’ve just met end up telling me their life stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8bc7&quot; id=&quot;8bc7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And I enjoy those kinds of parties a lot more than I used to. People are a lot more interesting than they used to be. But of course, I’m the one that’s changed. These people have always been interesting, I just hadn’t noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1c7c&quot; id=&quot;1c7c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve become friends with many of my guests, not “expanded my network” or “leveraged my platform”, but simply become friends. We get together for drinks and exchange crazy ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;638a&quot; id=&quot;638a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Today our world is filled with click-bait content, influence marketers, and fake-it-till-you-make-it founders, but we are desperate for honest connection. I think the reason people have responded so passionately to my stories is not because they are exceptionally interesting, but because it gives them permission to share their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c098&quot; id=&quot;c098&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Podcasting is uniquely suited to this intimately sharing of oneself. It gives us the ability to literally whisper in people’s ears and tell them our secrets and our truth. That kind of honesty and connection is rare today. It is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;44d4&quot; id=&quot;44d4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And I don’t mean valuable in the simplistic capitalist sense of creating something that can be monetized. I mean it in the “whole is greater than the sum of its parts” sense of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4569&quot; id=&quot;4569&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That kind of personal, honest communication; that kind of connection is a big part of what makes us human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e9a1&quot; id=&quot;e9a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Over the past five years Disrupting Japan has evolved from a hobby to a full-time job to a passion project. I have no idea what it will be five years from now, but it feels like it’s just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
