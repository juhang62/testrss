<title>China clamping down on coronavirus research, deleted pages suggest</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/china-clamping-down-on-coronavirus-research-deleted-pages-suggest</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;China is cracking down on publication of academic research about the origins of the novel coronavirus, in what is likely to be part of a wider attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/chinese-social-media-censoring-officially-sanctioned-facts-on-coronavirus&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;control the narrative surrounding the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, documents published online by Chinese universities appear to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two websites for leading Chinese universities appear to have recently published and then removed pages that reference a new policy requiring academic papers dealing with Covid-19 to undergo extra vetting before they are submitted for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on the origins of the virus is particularly sensitive and subject to checks by government officials, the notices posted on the websites of Fudan University and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/china&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; University of Geosciences (Wuhan) said. Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,” he said. “It doesn’t mean the economy and public health aren’t important. But the narrative is paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the virus having infected more than a million people worldwide and caused heavy casualties particularly across Europe and the US, details about its origin and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;the first weeks of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; – when there was a cover-up by local officials – may be considered particularly sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If these documents are authentic it would suggest the government really wants to control the narrative about the origins of Covid-19 very tightly,” said Tsang of the reports of new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) appears to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:L9chDVyS40AJ:kjc.cug.edu.cn/info/1193/5233.htm+&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=de&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;published and then deleted&lt;/a&gt; new requirements that academic papers dealing with the origins of the virus be approved by China’s ministry of science and technology before publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university’s academic committee was expected to first go through the research “with an emphasis on checking the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is suitable for publication,” the regulation said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the checks have been completed, the school should report to the Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST], and it should only be published after it has [also] been checked by MOST,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its name, the geosciences university announced elsewhere on its website that it was carrying out coronavirus research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate document obtained by the Guardian, which could not be independently verified, appears to be from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and also said publication of research into the origins of Covid-19 would need approval from the science and technology ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another notice, which appears to have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20200409053204/http://www.it.fudan.edu.cn/Data/View/3657&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;published on 9 April&lt;/a&gt; by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, called for “strict and serious” management of papers investigating the source of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers could only be submitted for publication after being approved by a special office. Email, names and phone numbers provided on the notice suggested that office was part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/china&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;’s ministry of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source who alerted the Guardian to cached versions of the websites, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned by what appeared to be an attempt by Chinese authorities to intervene in the independence of the scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person said researchers submitting academic papers on other medical topics did not have to vet their work with government ministries before seeking publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technical analysis of the cached websites indicated that the posts were published on verified university websites before they were removed. The Guardian could not independently verify that they reflected a new government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notices appear to be part of a broader push to manage research on the virus. The science and technology ministry said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.most.gov.cn/tztg/202004/t20200403_152882.htm&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;on 3 April&lt;/a&gt; that ongoing clinical research on the coronavirus must be reported to authorities within three days or be halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March China’s president, Xi Jinping, published an essay that included “tracing the origin of the virus” on a list of national priorities. It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.most.gov.cn/jgdj/jcdt/202004/t20200408_152960.htm&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;referenced&lt;/a&gt; by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the Guardian to the Chinese embassy in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Huanan seafood “wet market”&lt;/a&gt; in Wuhan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link__container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link__header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;How did coronavirus start and where did it come from? Was it really Wuhan's animal market?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,” Carrico said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face … that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;could have come from outside the country&lt;/a&gt;. The foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested without evidence that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Enemy AI: chasing a player without Navigation2D or A* pathfinding</title>
<link>https://abitawake.com/news/articles/enemy-ai-chasing-a-player-without-navigation2d-or-a-star-pathfinding</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://abitawake.com/news/articles/enemy-ai-chasing-a-player-without-navigation2d-or-a-star-pathfinding</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Making a game where your enemies need to chase the player?  This starts out easy, make the enemy run towards the player!  But what happens when they are behind a tree?  Or around the corner of a wall?  Well, now your enemy looks quite silly as it is stuck against the object, running in place.  Not good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this, you could use the Navigation2D or AStar nodes built into Godot (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad6Us73smNs&quot;&gt;here's a tutorial by GDQuest covering both of them&lt;/a&gt;).  But for &lt;a href=&quot;https://helmsoffury.com&quot;&gt;Helms of Fury&lt;/a&gt; we used a different method which works great for our game and we wanted to share in this tutorial.  Here's how it looks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/manakeep/users/58991d6d3c545a24383fe280/2020-04-06/twitter-700x400.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to assume you are making your enemies as KinematicBody2D objects, and that you are using a State Machine to manage their states.  Not sure what a State Machine is?  I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html&quot;&gt;this article explaining State Machines&lt;/a&gt; and why you would use them - and here's another &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdscript.com/godot-state-machine&quot;&gt;article on implementing simple State Machines in Godot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, here is a simple Chase state for a dumb enemy that just runs towards its target, and probably gets stuck on something along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; params&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dir &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;normalized&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_physics_process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;delta&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; motion &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dir &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;speed
  enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;move_and_slide&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;motion&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scent Trails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve this we make the player leave a trail of their past positions as they move.  This way, if the enemy cannot see the player, it can check if it can see any of these past positions, then follow them to the player.  Since this is similar to how a dog would track something, we'll call it a scent trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to make this scent trail work we need to add a Timer node to our player, make it autostart and set a wait_time (we used 0.1s), then add some code so when it times out it drops a scent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin_class&quot;&gt;KinematicBody2D&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; scent_scene &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin_function&quot;&gt;preload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;res://Player/Scent.tscn&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; scent_trail &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  $ScentTimer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;connect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;timeout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;add_scent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add_scent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; scent      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; scent_scene&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  scent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;player   &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player
  scent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;position

  Game&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;level&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;effects&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;add_child&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;scent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  scent_trail&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;push_front&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;scent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have to make our actual Scent.tscn that gets dropped.  This is just a simple Node2D scene that includes a Timer, so that the scent can expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin_class&quot;&gt;Node2D&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; player

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  $&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin_class&quot;&gt;Timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;connect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;timeout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;remove_scent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;remove_scent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  player&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;scent_trail&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;erase&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  queue_free&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the scents to be visible while debugging, you can add a ColorRect node to them, then just hide it once its working.  With this in place you should see scent's being left behind your player as you run around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we want our enemies to embrace their inner bloodhounds and follow these new scents when they cannot see the player.  But to make that work, we will need to add a RayCast2D node to our enemies, and setup Physics Layers in Godot so our ray knows what it can collide with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physics Layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up Physics Layers in Godot you want to click on Project from the top menu, then Project Settings, then near the bottom on the left side is a Layer Names section, and you want to choose 2D Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/manakeep/users/58991d6d3c545a24383fe280/2020-04-06/physics_layers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name these whatever you like for your game.  Once you have them named, go through the objects in your game, and in the Property Inspector sidebar you can expand Collision then click ·· to assign them.  For your objects you want to assign them as Layers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/manakeep/users/58991d6d3c545a24383fe280/2020-04-06/picking_physics_layers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Physics Layers assigned to your objects, now you want to update the RayCast2D on your enemies to check against the layers enemies cannot move through (in our case its solid, object, crate, hole, gate_closed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with our Physics Layers all setup, our last step is to update our Chase state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot; language-gdscript&quot;&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_physics_process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;delta&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; motion &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;dir &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;speed
  enemy&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;move_and_slide&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;motion&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now when an enemy enters the Chase state it tries to raycast to the player and if nothing is in the way - chase em!  If something is in the way, it goes through the scent trail in order and tries to raycast to each scent until it can see one, then - chase it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it now works, your enemies are bloodhounds!  To improve this further you may want collision avoidance between enemies, but perhaps that's a tutorial for another day ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's a Wrap!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>How to Speak (2018) [video]</title>
<link>https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/how-to-speak/index.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/how-to-speak/index.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;nav id=&quot;course_nav&quot; aria-label=&quot;Course&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;By the end of the next 60 minutes you will have been exposed to a lot of ideas, some of which you will incorporate into your own repertoire, and they will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sig&quot;&gt;— Patrick Winston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 40 years ago, Professor Patrick Henry Winston ’65, SM ’67, PhD ’70 gave his first talk on &lt;em&gt;How to Speak&lt;/em&gt;. As he wrote in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://alum.mit.edu/slice/how-speak&quot;&gt;Slice of MIT article from 2010&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Sjoberg, SM ’81, made me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sitting in my office, whining about somebody's horrible lectures, when he said, “You should do an IAP class on how to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said, “I've never given a lecture I rate at better than a B+; I'd be depressed for a month afterward; it would take a week to prepare; and, besides, nobody would come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'll come,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that first edition of &lt;em&gt;How to Speak&lt;/em&gt; drew about 100. This past week about 250 showed up. It's a little hard to say exactly because [the lecture hall] officially seats 150 and perhaps another 100 sat on the stairs and floor or stood in the back or watched from the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became so popular, in fact, that the annual talk had to be limited to the first 300 participants. Every year, Professor Winston improved upon the talk. As he put it, &quot;There is much more now, of course, because I keep learning new things. I've added techniques for passing oral exams, delivering successful job-interview talks, and ensuring that ideas become as famous as they ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Outline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;maintabletemplate&quot;&gt;

<title>Social distancing is bringing drive-in theaters back to life</title>
<link>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/drive-in-theaters-adapt-to-coronavirus</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/drive-in-theaters-adapt-to-coronavirus</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;Last month, John Watzke was&lt;/span&gt; going about a normal day at his drive-in theater in Ocala, Florida, when a customer called him to share concerns about COVID-19. Watzke, who has run the outdoor business since 2011, knew he had to think fast. “I got a window from my storage building, cut a hole in the concession’s sidedoor, and put the window in,” he says. “By the time everybody got here, they could safely pick up orders.” In less than a week, he gave the 72-year-old venue a total makeover: he acquired new food packaging, cordoned off parking spots to create buffer zones, and implemented strict sanitation guidelines for employees. The two-screen venue, which was relatively quiet this past winter, is now keeping busy even on weeknights, welcoming as many as 200 cars at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Though Florida is currently under a stay-at-home order, the Ocala Drive-In Theater is one of several drive-ins enjoying an unexpected renaissance, and says it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ocaladrivein/posts/1562135957295420?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAyFcd8WMseDsIDcQ_A_nA54-_iLeFDdioJjMc4InbBQMzQlMcBpO5Embmi0CoiqrUj3LISLgMWxzoTMXjmVfUcT4HsLqd23__1EVPuZC6om8Z5Vek1Nj1XdStMGjQuXkjx61__meftXBvBvwraGp9NJNc46KJR9zP8mvoV9hitIghjOBuHPi5QRa0U0ZOH0SVEOPIc0WFjAd-wkuTcYsB5Y-UywfZSDdLI76oAuXehTa-ol1qwgYhuS555Q-FHx1cUVQrrYdvj7KVJfFxw5VyybH5AfhSQHSowy0B2EeeSGr27n1uwr90IVoU-csfxPjhOC57-SReD_tnfuYT2fg&amp;amp;__tn__=-R&quot;&gt;received permission&lt;/a&gt; to remain open from the governor and local police. As the coronavirus pandemic has altered millions of lives across the U.S., these old-timey facilities offer a temporary escape from reality. Because visitors enjoy films from their cars, they can still practice social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Watzke, a 63-year-old former projectionist, has heard of at least 11 drive-in theaters in America that are currently operating under strict public health guidelines. While that’s a small fraction of the 305 businesses known to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association, the response he’s witnessed has been strong enough to offer a glimmer of hope. “This could actually be an upslope of the industry that we haven’t had in many a year,” Watzke says. &lt;em&gt;Atlas Obscura&lt;/em&gt; asked him how he’s nurturing his business and his community during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Ocala Drive-In, shown here in 2019, normally fills up in the summer months. These days, it's often full even on weekday evenings.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-74071&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/74071/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The Ocala Drive-In, shown here in 2019, normally fills up in the summer months. These days, it’s often full even on weekday evenings. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;John Watzke / Ocala Drive-In&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-second-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How sizable is the uptick in Ocala’s attendance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Business is almost double what it normally is this time of year. Now it’s more like the summer months. We are getting a lot of people from all over the state, some driving two hours or more. The last couple nights have been a little bit slow because I’m having trouble getting some new movies: Those I had scheduled from Disney, Universal, and Warner Brothers have been canceled. So I’m reaching out to some independent film companies. Regardless, I believe people will come as this gives them a chance to get out of the house. To watch a movie on a gorgeous screen in the state of Florida is totally different than watching a movie at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-second-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing new social distancing measures is expensive, but you haven’t raised ticket prices.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What makes all the extra effort and expenses worth it for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Number one: my employees keep their jobs. Two: I’ve been through several disasters in my life. I’m a Katrina victim—I was on the Mississippi coast. What I learned is that the things that bring just a few minutes of normal life to you are the things you remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;I’m a great believer that mental stability is as important as physical stability. If people don’t have a certain amount of normalcy in their life, it’s going to affect them. Especially the smaller children—they’ve been taken out of school and locked indoors. They can’t go see their friends, their grandparents. To them, they’re being punished, and they didn’t do anything. So if parents can take them to the movies and have a few hours of normal life, it kind of relieves the tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-second-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are visitors responding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Customers are thrilled to death that we are open and they have something to do. On Facebook, people are telling me how safe and comfortable they felt. There might be a dozen negative commenters, but I think it’s because they haven’t come out here. For them, this is not an essential business. It is to me. You have to have mental stability, too. My family has worked in theaters since 1913. My grandfather was a projectionist. My dad was a projectionist. My brother and I were projectionists, and our sons were projectionists. Basically, the old cliche, “The show must go on,” is a way of life for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;All over the world, drive-ins have been social distancing. This theater in Kornwestheim, Germany, was busy on March 20.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-74078&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/74078/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;All over the world, drive-ins have been social distancing. This theater in Kornwestheim, Germany, was busy on March 20. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Sebastian Gollnow / dpa via Getty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-second-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else is the drive-in trying to give back to the community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;A nondenominational church has service here two nights a week so people have the opportunity to worship from the safety of their vehicles. My offer is actually out there for any church that wants to use my sound equipment and transmitters. I’m not saying it has to be affiliated with a certain religion: Everybody’s got their own faith. If they want to use my property, they’re welcome to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;I’ve also offered my services at no cost to the county school board. In the event that seniors cannot have a traditional graduation, they could do a drive-in one. All the speeches and procedures would be projected on the big screen, and the students could walk up while maintaining a distance and get their diploma. It would only be immediately family, but we could live-stream everything so extended family could see it. The school board is considering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;I put the offer out a few weeks ago after my youngest daughter, who is graduating in May from nursing school, called me saying they had cancelled the ceremonies. That’s likely the first time in her life that there was nothing I could say or do to make things better. I was thinking that I can’t help her—she’s 700 miles away—but I can sure make it better for the seniors here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;article-second-subheading-pre-rd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think this surge in attendance at drive-ins around the country will help the industry in the long run?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Right now, I feel that customers are going to keep coming because they appreciate the extra effort I’m putting forth. And I think people will realize that, no matter the situation, they’re safer at a drive-in than they are in a building with a crowd. I really think it’s gonna help the drive-ins. Will it last? Only time will tell. I do think people will be looking for outdoor activities for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Of course we still have a lot of obstacles that we fight regularly: weather, daylight savings time, DVDs. But I would love to see drive-ins make a comeback. I would like to see the next generation keep this going. This is a part of American history that shouldn’t die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.atlasobscura.com/t/social-distancing-is-bringing-drive-in-theaters-back-to-life-discussion-thread/37300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;join the conversation&lt;/a&gt; about this and other stories in the Atlas Obscura Community Forums.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bored? How about trying a Linux speed run?</title>
<link>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/04/11/pengrun/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/04/11/pengrun/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of dumb ideas. I tend to write them down and then revisit them from time to time. Sometimes, the world and/or my own understanding of it has moved enough to where it can now be taken to a new place. Sometimes these ideas then &quot;snap together&quot; to inspire something else entirely. This is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15 years ago, I mused about the idea of having a &quot;desert island machine&quot;. This is where I'd put someone in a room with a box that has a couple of hard drives and a working network connection. HD #1 is blank. HD #2 has a few scraps of a (Linux) OS on it: bootloader, kernel, C library and compiler, that sort of thing. There's a network connection of some sort, and that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no editors and nothing more advanced than 'cat' to read files. You don't have jed, joe, emacs, pico, vi, or ed (eat flaming death). Don't even think about X. telnet, nc, ftp, ncftp, lftp, wget, curl, lynx, links? Luxury! Gone. Perl, Python and Ruby? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's your situation. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized a few years later that this was just an exercise in flexing the fact that I could probably bootstrap my way up from this with the C compiler to write a terrible editor, then write a terrible TCP client, find my way out to ftp.gnu.org, get wget, and keep going from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that documentation is plentiful. You want a copy of the Stevens book so you can figure out how to do a DNS query by banging UDP over the network? Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, like I said, that was roughly 2005. Tonight, while revisiting it, I turned it into a new idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put it this way, perhaps you are familiar with the notion of &quot;speed runs&quot;. This is where people with insanely good twitch reflexes and a penchant for finding neat tricks rip their way through video games, making things faster and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you see things like people managing to do the original Super Mario Bros game from the 80s in under five minutes, and I do mean people. There are actual humans frobbing plastic controllers doing this! Just dig around on your favorite giant video-streaming site if you need evidence of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the pitch: Linux speedruns. By that, I don't mean &quot;speedrunning a game on a Linux box&quot; (like emulation, or something). Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean speedrunning the Linux situation itself. Start with a minimal system and get yourself to the point where you can do something meaningful (like reading cat pictures on Reddit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine if people started doing this, then eventually there would be shortcuts. Someone would memorize the IP address to ftp.gnu.org so they didn't have to speak DNS in order to get there. Someone else would memorize the byte sequence of a binary and blast it through xxd to get cranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then someone would decide it's too easy if you have this thing or that thing, and they'd cut down the starting conditions. Who knows how far down the stack this could go? How much insanity could we see? Considering most of humanity is holed up trying to avoid the rest of itself, maybe this is exactly the time for that kind of thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go on, Internet. Surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be the Baseketball of system administration.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nasty macOS flaw is bricking MacBooks: Don&amp;#039;t install this update</title>
<link>https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nasty-macos-flaw-is-bricking-macbooks-dont-install-this-update</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nasty-macos-flaw-is-bricking-macbooks-dont-install-this-update</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A new macOS update is causing more problems than it fixes, with Mac users reporting a host of nasty problems — including bricked MacBooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The 8 April 2020 Supplemental Update for Catalina 10.15.4 brought the system down for a few hours,&quot; said one poster on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251259424?page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple's own discussion forums&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;hawk-widget&quot; data-render-type=&quot;fte&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;seasonal&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;WARNING macOS Catalina 10.15.4 Supplemental Update BRICKED my 13 inch Macbook 2018!&quot; posted another user on &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-macos-catalina-10-15-4-supplemental-update-bricked-my-13-inch-macbook-2018.2230133/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MacRumors' forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This bricked my 2019 MBP. Not providing power to devices either. Needs an SMC reset but won’t accept it,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-macos-catalina-10-15-4-supplemental-update-with-facetime-bug-fix.2230108/page-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted a third&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Be afraid, be very afraid. Timing couldn't be more brutal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other users reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251263032&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the download didn't work at all&lt;/a&gt; through the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supplemental update for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomsguide.com/news/macos-catalina&quot;&gt;macOS 10.15.4 Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, released Wednesday (April 8), was meant to resolve issues created by the 10.15.4 update in late March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That earlier update created issues with systems crashing during large file transfers, failures to wake up from sleep mode, unresponsive USB-C ports, random restarts and even kernel panics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-about-the-bad-macos-catalina-update&quot;&gt;What to do about the bad macOS Catalina update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new update may indeed fix those, but it seems to be making things worse. Until Apple sorts this all out, don't install the Supplemental Update for Catalina 10.15.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have done so and your machine is stuck or otherwise hangs, one poster on Apple's discussions forums might have found a way around the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I went to Recovery Mode, ran the Disk Utilities First Aid and then rebooted again,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251259424?page=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tim01 posted&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;My screen came up and I was able to sign in.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>John Conway: A Life in Games (2015)</title>
<link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Gnawing on his left index finger with his chipped old British teeth, temporal veins bulging and brow pensively squinched beneath the day-before-yesterday’s hair, the mathematician John Horton Conway unapologetically whiles away his hours tinkering and thinkering — which is to say he’s ruminating, although he will insist he’s doing nothing, being lazy, playing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;podcast-aside&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based at Princeton University, though he found fame at Cambridge (as a student and professor from 1957 to 1987), Conway, 77, claims never to have worked a day in his life. Instead, he purports to have frittered away reams and reams of time playing. Yet he is Princeton’s John von Neumann Professor in Applied and Computational Mathematics (now emeritus). He’s a fellow of the Royal Society. And he is roundly praised as a genius. “The word ‘genius’ gets misused an awful lot,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150414-for-persi-diaconis-next-magic-trick/&quot;&gt;Persi Diaconis, a mathematician at Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;. “John Conway is a genius. And the thing about John is he’ll think about anything.… He has a real sense of whimsy. You can’t put him in a mathematical box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hoity-toity Princeton bubble seems like an incongruously grand home base for someone so gamesome. The campus buildings are Gothic and festooned with ivy. It’s a milieu where the well-groomed preppy aesthetic never seems passé. By contrast, Conway is rumpled, with an otherworldly mien, somewhere between &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;’s Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf. Conway can usually be found loitering in the mathematics department’s third-floor common room. The department is housed in the 13-story Fine Hall, the tallest tower in Princeton, with Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T cell towers on the rooftop. Inside, the professor-to-undergrad ratio is nearly 1-to-1. With a querying student often at his side, Conway settles either on a cluster of couches in the main room or a window alcove just outside the fray in the hallway, furnished with two armchairs facing a blackboard — a very edifying nook. From there Conway, borrowing some Shakespeare, addresses a familiar visitor with his Liverpudlian lilt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome! It’s a poor place but mine own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conway’s contributions to the mathematical canon include innumerable games. He is perhaps most famous for inventing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html&quot;&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1960s. The &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; columnist Martin Gardner called it “Conway’s most famous brainchild.” This is not Life the family board game, but Life the cellular automaton. A cellular automaton is a little machine with groups of cells that evolve from iteration to iteration in discrete rather than continuous time — in seconds, say, each tick of the clock advances the next iteration, and over time, behaving a bit like a transformer or a shape-shifter, the cells evolve into something, anything, everything else. Life is played on a grid, like tic-tac-toe, where its proliferating cells resemble skittering microorganisms viewed under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Game of Life is not really a game, strictly speaking. Conway calls it a “no-player never-ending” game. The recording artist and composer &lt;a href=&quot;http://brian-eno.net/reissues/&quot;&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt; once &lt;a href=&quot;https://edge.org/response-detail/11154&quot;&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; that seeing an electronic &lt;a href=&quot;http://exs.exploratorium.edu/blog/cellular-automata/&quot;&gt;Game of Life exhibit&lt;/a&gt; on display at the Exploratorium in San Francisco gave him a “shock to the intuition.” “The whole system is so transparent that there should be no surprises at all,” Eno said, “but in fact there are plenty: The complexity and ‘organic-ness’ of the evolution of the dot patterns completely beggars prediction.” And as suggested by the narrator in an episode of the television show &lt;em&gt;Stephen Hawking’s Grand Design&lt;/em&gt;, “It’s possible to imagine that something like the Game of Life, with only a few basic laws, might produce highly complex features, perhaps even intelligence. It might take a grid with many billions of squares, but that’s not surprising. We have many hundreds of billions of cells in our brains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life was among the first cellular automata and remains perhaps the best known. It was coopted by Google for one of its Easter eggs: Type in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/#q=conway%27s+game+of+life&quot;&gt;Conway’s Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;,” and alongside the search results ghostly light-blue cells will appear and gradually overrun the page. Practically speaking, the game nudged cellular automata and agent-based simulations into use in the complexity sciences, where they model the behavior of everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140409-the-remarkable-self-organization-of-ants/&quot;&gt;ants&lt;/a&gt; to traffic to clouds to galaxies. Impractically speaking, it became a cult classic for those keen on wasting time. The spectacle of Life cells morphing on computer screens proved dangerously addictive for graduate students in math, physics and computer science, as well as for many people with jobs that provided access to idling mainframe computers. A U.S. military report estimated that the workplace hours lost clandestinely watching Life evolve on computer screens cost millions of dollars. Or so one Life legend has it. Another purports that when Life went viral in the early-to-mid-1970s, one-quarter of all the world’s computers were playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when Conway’s vanity strikes, as it often does, and he opens the index of a new mathematics book, casually checking for his name, he gets peeved that more often than not his name is cited only in reference to the Game of Life. Aside from Life, his myriad contributions to the canon run broad and deep, though with such meandering interests he considers himself quite shallow. There’s his first serious love, geometry, and by extension symmetry. He proved himself by discovering what’s sometimes called Conway’s constellation — three sporadic groups among a family of such groups in the ocean of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150813-how-does-symmetry-shape-natures-laws/&quot;&gt;mathematical symmetry&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest of his groups, called the Conway group, is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20131220-nudging-spheres-closer-little-by-little/&quot;&gt;Leech lattice&lt;/a&gt;, which represents a dense packing of spheres in 24-dimensional space where each sphere touches 196,560 other spheres. He also shed light on the largest of all the sporadic groups, the Monster group, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150312-mathematicians-chase-moonshines-shadow/&quot;&gt;“Monstrous Moonshine” conjectures&lt;/a&gt;, reported in a paper composed frenetically with his eccentric Cambridge colleague Simon Norton. And his greatest masterpiece, in his own opinion at least, is the discovery of a new type of numbers, aptly named “surreal” numbers. The surreals are a souped-up continuum of numbers, including all the reals — integers, fractions and irrationals such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://oeis.org/A001113&quot;&gt;Euler’s number&lt;/a&gt; (2.718281828459045235360287471352662 … ) — and then going above and beyond and below and within, gathering in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20131126-to-settle-infinity-question-a-new-law-of-logic/&quot;&gt;all the infinites&lt;/a&gt;, all the infinitesimals, and amounting to the largest possible extension of the real-number line. In Gardner’s reliable assessment, the surreals are “infinite classes of weird numbers never before seen by man.” And they may turn out to explain everything from the incomprehensible infinitude of the cosmos to the infinitely tiny minutiae of the quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truly amazing thing about the surreal numbers is how Conway found them: by playing and analyzing games. Like an Escher tessellation of birds morphing into fish — focus on the white and you see the birds, focus on the red and you see fish — Conway beheld a game, such as Go, and saw that it embedded or contained something else entirely, the numbers. And when he found these numbers, he walked around in a white-hot daydream for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his heyday at Cambridge in the 1970s, sandals-in-all-seasons Conway would typically saunter into the mathematics department common room and announce his arrival by slapping his hand on one of the large steel girders in the middle of the room. This generated a satisfyingly dissonant &lt;em&gt;dinggggg&lt;/em&gt;. Another day of play now in session. One game, called Phutball, provided endless amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;simple_aside alignright&quot; readability=&quot;18.646385110952&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phutball Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in the paper “&lt;a href=&quot;http://erikdemaine.org/papers/Phutball/&quot;&gt;Phutball Endgames Are Hard&lt;/a&gt;,” by Erik Demaine, Martin Demaine and David Eppstein: “John Conway’s game Phutball, also known as Philosopher’s Football, starts with a single black stone (the ball) placed at the center intersection of a rectangular grid such as a Go board. Two players sit on opposite sides of the board and take turns. On each turn, a player may either place a single white stone (a man) on any vacant intersection, or perform a sequence of jumps. To jump, the ball must be adjacent to one or more men. It is moved in a straight line (orthogonal or diagonal) to the first vacant intersection beyond the men, and the men so jumped are immediately removed. If a jump is performed, the same player may continue jumping as long as the ball continues to be adjacent to at least one man, or may end the turn at any point. Jumps are not obligatory: one can choose to place a man instead of jumping. The game is over when a jump sequence ends on or over the edge of the board closest to the opponent (the opponent’s goal line) at which point the player who performed the jumps wins. It is legal for a jump sequence to step onto but not over one’s own goal line. One of the interesting properties of Phutball is that any move could be played by either player, the only partiality in the game being the rule for determining the winner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conway invented this game, a two-player board game with stones governed by wickedly negative feedback, with a Greek chorus of graduate students at his knee. But despite the fact that he made it up himself, this is not a game at which Conway excels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you take your turn you get this horrible feeling in the pit of your stomach. Because every move is bad. Instead of selecting the move that is best, you select the move that is least bad.… You make any move and immediately feel you shouldn’t have done it, and you think to yourself, Oh God, what have I done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A de facto Phutball rule allows that if after a particularly excruciatingly bad move a player says, “Please, may I cry?” and the request is granted, then the move can be taken back and replayed. But even with such concessions, Conway is not very good at Phutball, and indeed he is not very good at game playing generally, or at least not very good at winning. Nevertheless, he was the perpetrator of endless gaming sessions in the common room, ultimately elevating games to a suitable subject for serious research, albeit punctuated by spasmodic outbursts in which he leapt into the air, latched onto a pipe along the ceiling, and swung violently back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trapeze act hardly made Conway the department’s leading acrobat. He was outperformed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/PAPERS/68.pdf&quot;&gt;Frank Adams&lt;/a&gt;, an algebraic topologist and mountaineer who liked to climb under a table without touching the floor. Conway found Adams intimidating, a forbiddingly serious mathematician. The Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry, Adams had a reputation for being hard to please, a hard lecturer and hard on himself. Colleagues suspected his relentless ambition was to blame for his periodic nervous breakdowns. Adams worked like a man possessed, and this made Conway uneasy. He was sure Adams disapproved of his comparatively slothful recreational ethic. This in turn caused Conway to feel guilty, to worry that he was on the verge of being sacked — and he now had a wife and an increasing brood of daughters to support. He had married Eileen Howe, a teacher of French and Italian, in 1961. “He was an unusual young man, which is what attracted me,” she said. “John and I went to a restaurant soon after we met, and I was standing back waiting for him to open the door. And he said, ‘Well, go on, then!’ Most young men were opening doors and pulling out chairs and that sort of thing. But it just didn’t occur to him. He didn’t think that way. There’s a door, you’re standing in front of me, so why not go in? And it’s logical, I suppose.” Once married, they had four girls, spaced arithmetically (if unintentionally) one, two and three years apart (Conway memorized his girls’ birthdates by classifying them as “the 60-Fibs,” since they were born in 1960 plus the Fibonacci numbers, i.e., 1960 + 2, 3, 5, 8 = 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conway had good reason to worry about losing his job. By 1968, he had not accomplished much. All he was doing, after all, was squatting in the common room playing games, inventing games and reinventing rules to games he found boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conway likes games that move in a flash. He used to play backgammon constantly, for small stakes — money, chalk, honor — though for all that practice he was not terribly good at backgammon, either. He took too many risks, accepting doubles when he shouldn’t and upping the ante to as much as 64 times the original stakes merely to see what would happen, all the while talking math. For example, there was Conway’s Piano Problem, which asked: What’s the largest object that can be maneuvered around a right-angle corner in a fixed-width corridor? (The lower bound for the object’s area is &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;π&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is possible to do better. But to find out how much better is very difficult.) He wasn’t interested in winning at backgammon as much as he was interested in the possibilities of the game. He liked to play a flamboyant “back game,” falling intentionally behind with inexplicably loony plays. Opponents, witnessing such folly, would let their guard down and get careless, gradually losing ground. Then Conway would make his move. Usually this strategy backfired and he lost as expected. But every now and then, depending on the luck of the dice — the element of chance is key in backgammon, and consequently the game defies much mathematical analysis and any pretensions of a serious research agenda — Conway would successfully rush in from behind and pull off a spectacular win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Conway was hopelessly addicted to backgammon, some of his colleagues carefully rationed their own participation, and others abstained outright, fearing that if they submitted at all they’d be sucked in and their research derailed. Other colleagues expressed concern that Conway was setting a bad example and corrupting the souls of graduate students. This, of course, was his plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such student was Simon Norton, a child prodigy who had attended Eton College and managed to earn an undergraduate degree at the University of London during his last year of secondary school. When he arrived at Cambridge, Norton, already a backgammon whiz, easily fell in with the crowd. A lightning-fast calculator, he became Conway’s protégé, working out all the problems Conway couldn’t solve. He kept tabs on virtually all problems under way by everyone, snooping and eavesdropping and interrupting and bleating out &lt;em&gt;“Fallllllssse!!”&lt;/em&gt; when he noticed a mistake. He also had a capacious vocabulary, which the logophile Conway appreciated, at least when Norton deigned to display this talent. He was known for his speedy solutions in games of anagrams that flew around the room in the interest of wasting time. To wit, one day someone served up “phoneboxes.” And before anyone could even cock his head to ponder, Norton declared: “Xenophobes!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly Conway played silly children’s games — Dots and Boxes, Fox and Geese — and sometimes he played them with children, primarily his four young girls. And of course he also played games with his floating population of acolytes, often games they invented for his delectation. Colin Vout came up with the game COL and Simon Norton made up SNORT, both map-coloring games. Norton also produced Tribulations, and Mike Guy parried with Fibulations, both Nim-like games based on triangle numbers and Fibonacci numbers. Conway invented Sylver Coinage, in which two players alternate in naming different positive integers, but they are not allowed to name any number that is the sum of any previously named number, and the first player who names “1” is the loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these games went into the book &lt;em&gt;Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays&lt;/em&gt;, by Conway and two co-authors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.berkeley.edu/~berlek/&quot;&gt;Elwyn Berlekamp&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of California, Berkeley, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.ucalgary.ca/math_unitis/profiles/richard-guy&quot;&gt;Richard Guy&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book took 15 years to write, in part because Conway and Guy were prone to silliness, punning back and forth and wasting Berlekamp’s time — Berlekamp called them “a couple of goons.” In the end and against all odds the book became a bestseller (the color printing and unusual typefaces increased the production costs so much that the advertising budget decreased to nothing). It was a self-help book, of sorts, on how to win at games. The authors spilled out a cornucopia of theories, along with many new games to match the theoretical purposes. According to Conway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would invent a new game in the morning with the intention of it serving as an application of a theory. And then after half an hour’s investigation, it would prove to be stupid. So we’d invent another game. There are 10 half-hours in the working day, roughly speaking, so we invented 10 games a day. We’d analyze them and sift them, and let’s say one in 10 of them was good enough to make the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They amassed a surfeit of games without names and names without games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the Marriage Problem. You see we would invent a new game, and if it was a success, there would then be the problem of giving it some catchy kind of name. We’d try out a name, and usually we wouldn’t solve this naming problem. So the game might go in the file called “Games Without Names.” And then Richard, being his usual precise, persnickety self, had another file called “Names Without Games.” Any attempt to invent a new name for a game generated a whole lot of names, none of which were quite right, but they were quite often good names. So they went in the “Names Without Games” file. Each of these lists grew. And we seldom managed to marry one from this file to one from that file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the name without a game that was the best name without a game. It was called Don’t Ring Us, We’ll Ring You. We never got around to inventing that game, but the type of game is pretty clear: In this game there would be some thing or another that each player would draw on paper, and the aim is to draw a ring around your opponent. For a game like that, Don’t Ring Us, We’ll Ring You would be a lovely name. But we never actually found a game to fit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every so often, Conway visited Martin Gardner and the two traded material on mathematical recreations — if not games, per se, then puzzles, and all sorts of nerdish delights. Take, for instance, Conway’s Doomsday Algorithm, by which he displayed his prodigious skill at naming the day of the week for any given date. Although Conway had been showing off this trick since he was a teen, the algorithm came about during a visit with Gardner. Conway flew to New York and waited for his friend to pick him up at the airport. And he waited, and waited, and waited. Gardner did not turn up as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought, Okay, he’s going to turn up in five minutes. But I waited there a hell of a long time, probably an hour, I don’t know. And I had started to think, “Well, what happens if he doesn’t turn up?” I didn’t have a phone number for him. And it wouldn’t matter if I did because I didn’t know how to work the American pay-phone system — I’m still like this, you might notice. So the easiest thing to do was to just sit there and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than two hours late, Gardner came running in, waving madly from the far end of the arrivals terminal, apologetic and promising, “You’ll forgive me as soon as you know what I’ve just discovered!” He’d been at the New York Public Library, where he had found a note published in an 1887 issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; magazine — “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v35/n909/abs/035517a0.html&quot;&gt;To Find the Day of the Week for Any Given Date&lt;/a&gt;,” sent in by Lewis Carroll, who wrote: “Having hit upon the following method of mentally computing the day of the week for any given date, I send it you in the hope that it may interest some of your readers. I am not a rapid computer myself, and as I find my average time for doing any such question is about 20 seconds, I have little doubt that a rapid computer would not need 15.” Gardner couldn’t resist photocopying this choice find, but there was a long queue at the copy machine. He got in line. The line moved slowly. By the time it became apparent that he was bound to be late picking up Conway, he’d already invested 30 minutes, and he figured another 15 would suffice. He felt it was worth the wait, and he knew Conway would agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they finally arrived at Gardner’s home, Gardner went straight to his file cabinets and produced 20-odd articles about working out the day of the week for any given date. The Lewis Carroll rule, in his view, was the best yet. All the same, he turned to Conway and said, “John, you ought to work out an even simpler rule that I can tell my readers.” And so during what Conway refers to as the long winter’s nights after Mr. and Mrs. Gardner had toddled off to bed (though the visits were always in the summer), Conway thought about how to work out the day of the week in a way he could explain to the average anyone on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was still thinking during the flight home and back in the common room, when he hit upon a method he called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/calendar-algorithm/&quot;&gt;Doomsday Rule&lt;/a&gt;. The algorithm requires only addition, subtraction and memory. Conway devised a mnemonic method of sorts, whereby as you work through the algorithm you store all the necessary information on the fingers of your outstretched hand — outstretched so as to better bear the burden of the megabytes. And in order to remember a certain important piece of information about the date in question, Conway bares his teeth and bites into his thumb really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tooth marks must be showing! That way the thumb remembers. And whenever I lecture on this I go to someone in the front row and ask them to certify that they can see the tooth marks. It really does help. You can’t get serious people to do it, because they think it is childish. But the point about doing it is that this whole business occupies quite a substantial part of your brain, and then you forget what the person said their birthday was. This way the thumb remembers how far the birthday was away from the nearest Doomsday, and your thumb is perfectly capable of remembering that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years Conway has taught the Doomsday Rule to thousands upon thousands of people — and on occasion as many as 600 or so at a time, all crammed together in a conference hall calculating each other’s birthdays and biting their thumbs. And always endeavoring to be unreasonable, Conway was not satisfied with his easiest of algorithms. As soon as he designed it, he started improving it — with some doggerel poetry (another mnemonic of sorts) composed by Richard Guy. His main motivation was that he yet again wanted the rule to be as simple as possible, especially for the purposes of teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to his regular visits, Conway had made a habit of summarizing his recreational research in lengthy letters to Gardner. He’d feed a hefty roll of foolscap, like butcher paper, into his typewriter, and type out an ongoing stream until it was long enough to send — three or four feet would be long enough, he figured, though Gardner cut up one letter into the equivalent of 11 legal-size pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conway typically began his letters with a preamble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I got your first parcel of books just before Christmas, and was so delighted I spent the next few days reading and re-reading them, particularly the Annotated Alice, which is superb. (My wife was very annoyed with you!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he’d launch into research updates, beginning with, say, (1) his solution for dividing cake, then moving on to (2) a new wire and string puzzle, and then the bulk of the letter given over to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Sprouts. The following game was invented a fortnight ago, on a Tuesday afternoon. By Wednesday it had infected our Maths dept beyond recall — even the secretarial staff had succumbed. We started with&lt;/em&gt; n &lt;em&gt;spots on a piece of paper. The move is to join two of these spots — which are allowed to be the same spot — by a curve, and then to create a new spot on this curve. The curve must not pass through old spots, nor may it cross old curves, and at no time may any spot have more than 3 arcs emanating from it. In normal sprouts a player who cannot make a move loses, so that the object is to move last — in misère sprouts the last player loses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprouts, invented with his graduate student Mike Paterson, became the subject of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mathematical-games-1967-07/&quot;&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; column&lt;/a&gt; published in July 1967. Working on the column, Gardner wrote back to Conway with a list of questions, leaving more than ample space for him to fill in the answers, beginning with a question about his name, John H. Conway: “What does the H stand for?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horton. Why so much space for this? Did you expect something like Hog- ginthebottomtofflinghame-Frobisher-Williamss-Jenkinson?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner also wanted more details on the genesis of the game. “I predict that it will become such a standard, well known game that it will be of interest to record a few details about the circumstances surrounding its invention,” Gardner wrote. “Could you supply a few details? Doodling during a lecture? (If so, what lecture?) Doodling over glasses of beer?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were doodling long after teatime in the Department common room trying to invent a good pencil and paper game. This was some days after I’d more or less completely analyzed the Lucasian game, an old game also with spots, but with no new spots added, so it doesn’t “sprout.” It originally came from a rather complicated game about folding stamps which [Mike Patterson] had put into pencil and paper form, and we were successively modifying the rules. At one point [Mike] said “why not put a new spot in the middle” … and as soon as this was adopted all the other rules were discarded, the starting position was simplified to just&lt;/em&gt; n &lt;em&gt;points (originally 3), and sprouts sprouted. …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The day after sprouts sprouted it seemed that everyone was playing it. At coffee or tea times there were little groups of people poring over ridiculous-to-fantastic sprout positions. Some people were already attacking sprouts on Klein bottles and the like, with at least one man thinking of higher-dimensional versions … one found the remains of sprout games in the most unlikely places.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whenever I try to acquaint somebody new to the game nowadays, it always seems that they’ve already heard of it by some devious route. Even my 3 and 4 year old daughters play it with each other, though I can usually beat them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Conway kept it coming, heading the next month’s letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IN SPROUTOLOGY!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Gardner’s prediction about continued interest in the game has proved correct. The World Game of Sprouts Association is “devoted to the discovery of sprouts reality” and to “a serious exploration of the game,” and holds an annual championship tournament online. “For humans only” is one of the rules, since extensive computer analysis of the game over the years inspired some to enter their computer programs in the tournament rather than themselves. Conway only recently learned of the World Game of Sprouts Association, but he has been well aware of computers playing the game. Computers were all the rage when he invented Sprouts, and they were a large part of his motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was distressed. Computers were being used to solve a number of open problems — computers could solve problems standing for 100 years. We wanted to invent a game that would be hard to analyze by computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it took a while, in the early 1990s a trio from Bell Labs and Carnegie Mellon University produced a paper documenting a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/Sprouts.htm&quot;&gt;Computer Analysis of Sprouts&lt;/a&gt;,” analyzing the winning strategy for games with up to 11 spots. “Beyond &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 11 their program was unable to cope with sprouting complexity,” Gardner reported back to his readers. Decades later, a pair of French students wondered whether the 11-spot record was beatable. As a hobby, they developed software called GLOP — based on the French comic-strip character Pif le chien, who says “Glop” to express satisfaction. They produced a doctoral thesis on the subject, and they claimed to have solved Sprouts games with up to 44 dots. When Conway heard this he was somewhat curious, if incredulous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that very much. They are basically saying they have done the impossible. If someone says they’ve invented a machine that can write a play worthy of Shakespeare, would you believe them? It’s just too complicated. If someone said they’d been having some success teaching pigs to fly…. Though if they were doing that over in the field behind the Institute [for Advanced Study in Princeton], I would like to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one final sampling of Conway’s infinite gamesomeness, consider the game Traffic Jams, in which a fictitious country is represented by a triangular map and towns are represented by letters, all named after real towns in Wales — such as Aberystwyth, Oswestry, and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suspects that Conway designed this game solely to provide himself with an opportunity to offhandedly pronounce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BXKsQ2nbno&quot;&gt;Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch&lt;/a&gt;, a word he saw stretched out on a sign at said town’s railway station and on a sign in the town square. He observed that the two signs differed slightly, having 57 and 58 letters, respectively. The pertinent question regarding this game is: What move should the first player make?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these games provided raw data when Conway’s surreal-number theory was in development. The perfect guinea pigs, the two key players, were his eldest daughters, Susie and Rosie, then about 7 and 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, during the surreals’ period of gestation and invention circa 1970, the British Go champion, Jon Diamond, was then a Cambridge math undergraduate. He founded the Cambridge Go Society, fueling a steady run of Go games in the common room. Diamond, now president of the British Go Association, doesn’t recall ever playing Conway. That’s probably because Conway rarely if ever actually played the game. He lurked nearby, stared at the board, and wondered why the move Diamond or his pal had just made was a good move or a bad move. Conway recalled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would discuss it as they played, and kibitzers were sitting around saying, “Why’d you make that stupid move?” And it looked just the same as all the good moves to me. I never understood Go. But I did understand that near the end of the game it broke up into a sum of games — within the big game there were a few smaller games in various regions of the board. So that provided the spur for me to work out the theory of sums of partizan [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spur, as if one was necessary, encouraged ever more gaming. Conway always carried the necessary ammunition on his person, the better to snare an unsuspecting opponent. And oddly enough in this pursuit he kept himself semi-organized with a leather games case well stocked with dice, checkers, a board, paper, pencils, maybe some rope, and always a few decks of cards. Card games and card tricks were his strong suit. His analysis of games with students, professors or visitors, or by himself, barefoot on the common room floor, evolved from single games to compound games, with players playing lots of games at once — sometimes, say, a game of chess and a game of Go as well as a game of Domineering — and deciding, one turn at a time, which game to make their move in. He filled his usual landslides of foolscap analyzing these games. Then, as he told a reporter from &lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt; magazine who came calling at Cambridge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had a fantastic surprise. I realized that there was an analogy between what I was writing down and the theory of real numbers. Then I looked at it and found it was much more than an analogy. It was the real numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And much, much more, which fittingly became known as the surreal numbers — the largest possible expansion of the real-number line — named as such by the Stanford computer scientist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/&quot;&gt;Donald Knuth&lt;/a&gt;. And forever thereafter, Conway did not worry about the hard-to-please workaholic Professor Frank Adams and his ilk. Conway figured his big discovery, which originated from playing silly games, took the bite out of the serious mathematicians. Once he found the surreals (and in the same 12-month period, his “annus mirabilis,” he invented the Game of Life and discovered the Conway group), he mandated what he calls “the Vow.” “Thou shalt stop worrying and feeling guilty; thou shalt do whatever thou pleasest.” He surrendered to his peripatetic curiosity and followed wherever it went, whether toward recreation or research, or someplace altogether nonmathematical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner summed up the surreals theory as “Vintage Conway: profound, pathbreaking, disturbing, original, dazzling, witty and splattered with outrageous Carrollian wordplay.… Are these not trivial beginnings? Yes, but they provide a secure foundation on which Conway … carefully builds a vast and fantastic edifice.” But an edifice of what? Conway, in a paper titled “All Numbers, Great and Small,” concluded with a similar question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the whole structure of any use?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is on the boundary between funny stuff and serious mathematics,” said the late Hungarian-American mathematician Paul Halmos. “Conway realizes it won’t be considered great, but he might still try to convince you that it is.” Quite to the contrary. Conway believes the surreals are great, and there’s no “might” about it. If anything, he is keenly disappointed that the surreals haven’t yet led to something greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does all this position him in mathematics’ ancient intellectual odyssey toward beauty and truth? Conway on occasion (when asked) sees himself as part of a marching band winding through the streets of time. Then again, unless asked, he rarely if ever stands back to situate himself within the enterprise as a whole. Others have tried. In this age of top-10 lists, the &lt;em&gt;Observer,&lt;/em&gt; the world’s oldest Sunday newspaper, listed Conway in its pantheon of mathematicians whose discoveries have changed our world. But just try to discuss the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/11/the-10-best-mathematicians&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Observer’s&lt;/em&gt; list&lt;/a&gt;, by the columnist Alex Bellos, with Conway, not to mention another list on which he recently found himself, by Clifford Pickover in his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/noodlead.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonders of Numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which contains a chapter dedicated to “A Ranking of the 10 Most Influential Mathematicians Alive Today.” Allude to either, and he demurs with a vengeance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice in one way. It really means that I might be one of the best-known mathematicians in the present day, and this is not quite the same as being the best. And it’s probably because of Life. But it’s embarrassing. Because people might think I’m behind it in some way. And I assure you I’m not. And it’s particularly embarrassing because at least one of those lists doesn’t include Archimedes and Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Conway’s view, Archimedes is the preeminent father of mathematics. It was Archimedes who first truly understood the real numbers, and he was the first mathematician to work out the value of π, proving it was between the upper bound of 3 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;; and the lower bound of 3 &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;71&lt;/sub&gt;. Yet in the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;’s ranking, it’s not Archimedes but Pythagoras at the top. If not the best mathematician, Pythagoras is perhaps the best-known, due to his namesake theorem. And generally the list comprises last-name-basis mathematicians who, in their day, appeared in the society pages of science: Euler, Gauss, Cantor, Erdős. Conway comes in toward the end, followed by Perelman and Tao, both of whom have been in the news lately. The Russian Grigori Perelman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/08/28/manifold-destiny&quot;&gt;solved the Poincaré conjecture&lt;/a&gt; and refused all the accolades, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/fields-medal/&quot;&gt;Fields Medal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html&quot;&gt;Terence Tao&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of California, Los Angeles, is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/20141210-prime-gap-grows-after-decades-long-lull/&quot;&gt;expert in prime numbers&lt;/a&gt; who accepted his 2006 Fields Medal and in 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ucla-math-prize-20140626-story.html&quot;&gt;won the inaugural $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conway’s salad days spanned the Sexy ’70s and the Excessive ’80s — and in the 1980s he divorced his first wife Eileen, married a mathematician named Larissa Queen and started another family; he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and a full professor at Cambridge; and then he jumped ship to Princeton in 1987. With Perelman and Tao and even Conway, we are too close to evaluate the long horizon of their contributions, especially by the criterion of whether their pure and abstract math will evolve to find practical application. The verdict on that often takes time, sometimes a long time. The notable exception is the late John Nash, a colleague of Conway’s at Princeton and the subject of the book and movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.simonandschuster.com/A-Beautiful-Mind/Sylvia-Nasar/9781451628425&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Beautiful Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nash made contributions in game theory, and these were quickly put to use in evolutionary biology, accounting, politics, military theory and market economics, earning him a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1994/&quot;&gt;Nobel Memorial Prize&lt;/a&gt; in Economic Sciences. (In Conway’s view, Nash’s Nobel work is less interesting than the deep and difficult, albeit less useful, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/1969989?origin=crossref&amp;amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&quot;&gt;Nash embedding theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which states that every Riemann manifold can be isometrically embedded in Euclidean space.) Conway has been in the running for the million-dollar “Nobel” of mathematics, the Abel Prize — which is to say he’s been nominated, and the nomination remains on file — with his group-theory work being the strongest point in his favor. He has won other big math prizes, but as yet has had no luck with the Abel. And for the most part any practical implications of his work also remain to be seen. Few doubt that at least some of his gems will find application. The surreals, for instance. “The surreal numbers will be applied,” said his colleague, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.ias.edu/people/faculty/sarnak&quot;&gt;Peter Sarnak&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. “It’s just a question of how, and when.” And Sarnak is one to sing Conway’s praises generally. “Conway is a seducer, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; seducer,” he said, speaking exclusively of Conway’s skills as a teacher and expositor, of course — whether in the classroom, or at math camp, doing standing-room-only public lectures or private parties, or in his edifying alcove in the Princeton common room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He can always be found ensconced in his alcove, not working. He hasn’t given up all hope for hitting upon more white-hot math like the surreals, but more often than not he is “thinkering” away with his beloved trivialities. Conway has no compunction about buttonholing strangers and serving them a rollicking riff on his many obsessions. One obsession of late is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604079&quot;&gt;Free Will Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, in which, he points out, every human being has a vested interest. Devised over the course of a decade with his Princeton colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.princeton.edu/directory/simon-kochen&quot;&gt;Simon Kochen&lt;/a&gt;, the Free Will Theorem is precisely formulated using geometry, quantum mechanics and philosophy, though the duo usually state it very basically as follows: If physicists have free will while performing experiments, then elementary particles possess free will as well. And this, they reckon, probably explains why and how humans have free will in the first place. It isn’t a circular argument so much as a spiral argument, a self-subsuming argument, spiraling outward and getting bigger and bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But usually it’s numbers that are the object of his infatuation. He turns numbers over, upside down, and inside out, observing how they behave. Above all he loves knowledge, and he seeks to know everything about the universe. Conway’s charisma lies in his desire to share his incurable lust for learning, to spread the contagion and the romance. He is dogged and undaunted in explaining the inexplicable, and even when the inexplicable remains so, he leaves his audience elevated, fortified by the failed attempt and feeling somehow in cahoots, privy to the inside dope, satisfied at having flirted with a glimmer of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Don&amp;#039;t Make Students Use Eclipse</title>
<link>https://nora.codes/post/stop-making-students-use-eclipse/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nora.codes/post/stop-making-students-use-eclipse/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Using Java or Python in a professional IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, PyCharm, or Eclipse is not a good first introduction to programming for computer science students, whether they’re in the field to become web developers, systems software engineers, or academic computer science researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some IDEs, such as jGRASP, provide education-specific tooling, like the “automatic generation of visualizations for improving the comprehensibility of the software”; that is, when you write a linked list and run your code in jGRASP, you see a diagram of a linked list on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jgrasp.org/images/ij_plugin.png&quot; alt=&quot;jGRASP in action in IntelliJ IDEA.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jGRASP, an education-focused IDE, can be used on its own or, as here, integrated with IntelliJ IDEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most IDEs, though, primarily serve two purposes for students. First, in a Java-focused curriculum, it &lt;strong&gt;insulates the student&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt; command line program, and the command line environment itself. Second, it catches some basic mistakes and allows the student to &lt;strong&gt;defer learning&lt;/strong&gt; about the finnicky language requirements that aren’t deemed core to the curriculum, like imports and file naming requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, I do believe that these are real problems. A student who has not written an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement doesn’t need to understand the philosophy behind putting each public class in its own file, or what &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; or “class” even means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-the-deal-with-these-ides&quot;&gt;What’s the deal with these IDEs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole purpose of an IDE is to provide an &lt;strong&gt;integrated&lt;/strong&gt; environment - it’s even in the name. It also provides a homogeneous environment for the instructor to instruct on; rather than teaching students how to install Java and a platform-specific programmer’s editor on each platform, they can just say “install this IDE, open it, and click New Project.” This is valuable in an introductory course, as it avoids wasting class time and lowers the barrier to entry, but it’s crucial to introduce these inconvenient details eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience as a student, after the first or second year of CS classes, students tend to grasp the basic control structures. They can write branches and loops and functions and use basic data structures like lists and maps. The ACM’s 2013 guidance on CS curricula agrees with me here; they recommend a focus on basic structures of programming languages and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they can’t do, unless they’ve figured it out on their own, is operate a computer outside of the confines of the IDE they’ve been taught. In none of the curricula I’ve seen, through personal experience or reading syllabi provided by other students, is there a place for students to get past the myriad of barriers that constitute the use of a computer in the modern day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who use Windows aren’t taught that, while their file system is case-insensitive, not all filesystems are. They probably aren’t taught that a “file system” is a concept until a 300-level operating systems course. Students who use Mac OS aren’t taught what the &lt;code&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; directory is, or why it’s irrelevant to their project submissions. Students learning Java don’t know that &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt; is their compiler and &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; their virtual machine, at least until they take a course in compilers. Nobody focuses on things like ASCII, Unicode, and UTF-8, or on how programs interoperate, or on how to share and distribute programs that students write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introductory CS curricula focus on abstract ideas of programming, and use IDEs to accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-this-a-problem&quot;&gt;Why is this a problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, okay, students are being taught how to write code and solve problems with math instead of grapple with the intricate details of the eldrich monstrosities that are modern operating systems. Surely that’s a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is, as Kevlin Henney is fond of saying, “Software is nothing &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; the details.” When students don’t understand what a file is, or haven’t ever edited text in anything but Microsoft Word and don’t realize they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; edit code outside of an IDE, they will not be able to do the crucial work of self-directed learning that is a hallmark of all computer science success. When students have only ever programmed in Java using some bespoke learning library provided by their professor, it will take them much longer than necessary to figure out other languages, other libraries, and other approaches. In a field that moves as fast as this one does, that’s a very serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also undermines their ability to learn in a classroom setting going forward. Among my fellow students, those who merely do what is expected of them - merely attend each and every class, do the reading, and do their problem sets and homework - aren’t prepared to learn about networking, or &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, or project management, because their knowledge is disconnected from the real world. Teaching someone to use &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; is very difficult if they’ve never been taught that a file is an logical unit composed of bytes and metadata. Teaching someone the importance of agile methodology is difficult if they’ve never distributed a piece of software, even to their professor or friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, though, it limits the ability of their &lt;em&gt;peers&lt;/em&gt; to learn. If a 300-level software engineering class which budgeted a week to teach basic version control skills has to take a two-day detour to teach the Windows users how to get rid of the CRLFs in their commits, and teach the Mac users to remove the &lt;code&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; files from their repositories, and get everyone set up in Eclipse EGIT, that’s wasted time. If the professor has to schedule time with students outside of class to demonstrate their code because so many students aren’t able to submit their code in a form that successfully runs on the professor’s computer, that’s wasted time for both professors and students, and it undermines important lessons about portability and good practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my core belief is this: Students need to know how to use computers before they can program them in a serious way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward-or-backwards-or-sideways&quot;&gt;Moving forward - or backwards, or sideways?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be clear - I’m not talking about MIT. I’m not talking about CMU or UC Berkeley (oh, I’m sorry, “Cal”). I’m not even talking about Stanford. I’m talking about other places - the SLACs that have four or five CS professors, the polytechnic universities, everywhere else. The places where “computer science” and “computer engineering” might not be different majors, and even if they are, they aren’t really different departments, different buildings, different schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we move forward? How do we build computer science programs that prepare students to build their own futures? We have to recognize what the ACM has been telling us since 2002 - that there are two or three tracks to “computer science”: what we might call “theoretical computer science”; what we might call “computer engineering”; and what we might call “software engineering”. We move forward by giving students a taste of all three when they enter the field, and letting them specialize as they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very sympathetic to the idea that getting students programming quickly is important. So do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide a standardized environment - as a VM, perhaps, or using something like repl.it or ideone - perhaps a similar software designed specifically for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a language that teaches the fundamentals of the paradigm you’re interested in, like Scheme or Python. (Please, please not Java.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide support for students who are interested in doing their own thing. This means having teaching assistants (and paying them!) who can help students beyond just answering questions about their homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even just an effective Python or Scheme curriculum at the 100 level would be a big improvement, but it’s not enough. We need to teach students about &lt;em&gt;computers&lt;/em&gt; themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first foray into programming, take time to teach students about the UNIX command line. (If you’re really, really committed to Windows for some reason, PowerShell is a great piece of software too!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show students how things they’re familiar with - graphical file managers, for instance - interact with these new command line skills, and how their programming languages interact with those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit to teaching a standardized environment that all students have access to. Ubuntu LTS is great for this, because people with their own computer can run it in a VM and the school can provide computers, and adventurous Windows users can use WSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, mathematics is the foundation of computer science. Blending that perspective with more practical elements is important so that students learning algorithms can implement them in the real world, and students building software can analyze it appropriately. Alongside the purely mathematical understanding and models of computing should come some exposure to “weird” programming languages like Haskell, Erlang, Prolog, Elm, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are hard changes for a lot of departments, especially those with faculty that hasn’t writted production software in decades, or has only used a non-UNIX OS for a long time. I don’t think that there’s any good reason to force students to figure this stuff out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who have a good understanding of theory, competence in a standard UNIX environment with some language of choice, and some exposure to other languages will be better professors, better engineers, and better web developers. Let’s improve this field for the future of computing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;4.5180722891566&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commenter on Lobste.rs pointed out that there are some great resources from MIT around learning tooling and build systems: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobste.rs/s/ti1k98/missing_semester_your_cs_education_mit&quot;&gt;The Missing Semester of Your CS Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lecture 1 | Free Will Lecture Series | Meet John Conway; hear about Simon Kochen and how the theorem came about. Thoughts on senility. Free will and determinism in science and philosophy over the last two millennia; the implications of Newtonian and quantum mechanics. What Conway and Kochen mean by “free will.” What the theorem does, and doesn’t, imply about behavior. A brief introduction to the three underlying principles of the theorem: SPIN, FIN, and TWIN.

<title>Moving Away from Gmail</title>
<link>https://rolisz.ro/2020/04/11/moving-away-from-gmail/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rolisz.ro/2020/04/11/moving-away-from-gmail/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://purelymail.com/&quot;&gt;PurelyMail&lt;/a&gt; and I will slowly switch all my online accounts to use it. I've been using it for almost three months and I didn't have any issues (except with some Hotmail/Outlook addresses).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a GMail account since 2006 (that's the date of the first email in my inbox), but I started actually using it more in 2009. I have around 120000 emails in total in my mailbox, about 17 Gb in total. I even worked as an SRE in the team responsible for the storage of GMail. So there's quite a bit of history between me and GMail, but I've started to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a long dream of mine to have an email address at my own domain. Technically, I had that ever since I started hosting my blog on a VPS from DigitalOcean, but I didn't set it up properly, so I never used it. I didn't want to use it only for forwarding the emails to GMail, I actually wanted to have send, receive and access emails from my own domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-leave-gmail&quot;&gt;Why leave GMail?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, because it's a single point of failure, which can fail due to many unrelated problems. Because my GMail address is my Google account basically, if for whatever reason I lose my GMail address, I lose all the things I have in my Google account: Google Drive, Google Photos, Play Store purchases, YouTube uploads and history, Google Calendar data and so on. While some of these can be backed up, such as Drive, Photos and YouTube, some cannot be, for example all the apps and movies I have purchased over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my GMail address can be lost for many reasons, many unrelated to GMail itself. I guess you can get the address suspended for spamming or doing other things, I'm not particularly worried about that. However, ToS violations of any kind, across other Google products, can lead to a ban on your account and implicitly, on your GMail address. There are many examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/google-suspends-customer-accounts-for-reselling-pixel-phones&quot;&gt;reselling Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2019/11/09/google-account-bans-youtube-emote-spam-markiplier/&quot;&gt;writing too many emojis in YouTube chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/07/android_developer_account_banned_for_life/&quot;&gt;for publishing &quot;repetitive content&quot; in the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. If you search on DuckDuckGo, I'm sure you can find many other examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the previous examples break the ToS? Some yes, some not. But the &lt;a href=&quot;https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en&quot;&gt;current ToS&lt;/a&gt; is 15 pages long and it changed 3 times in the last 4 years. And that's just a general ToS, Play Store has a separate ToS and YouTube as well. On top of this, they are quite vaguely formulated and many bans are unclear about the exact reason for which they have been instated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals process used to be completely opaque. Rumor has it that this has changed since they added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/02/google-finally-adds-consumer-customer-support-with-google-one/&quot;&gt;Google One service/platform/rebrand&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven't used the customer support from there myself, so I can't be sure. But even if now it works better and you can convince Google that your account was wrongfully suspended, it would be a couple of very stressful days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, I could use GMail with my own domain, but only by signing up for a business GSuite account. That comes with its own problems, such as not all features are available for business accounts and you can't move content that you've bought from the old, consumer address, to the new, business one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason because of which I'm leaving GMail is because it's kinda slow. A full load with an empty cache takes about 20 seconds on my desktop (good specs, wired Internet connection). Loading a folder with 184 emails takes 2.5 seconds. I miss computers being &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/input-lag/&quot;&gt;snappy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-requirements-for-an-email-provider&quot;&gt;My requirements for an email provider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent amount of storage. I accrued 17 Gb in more than 10 years of usage. So even 5  Gb would do the trick for 1-2 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server side based full text search. I want to be able to search for random emails, based on some word from the body of the email  that I vaguely remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to use multiple aliases. I want to have site_name@rolisz.ro, besides the main address I will give out, but still have everything come in to my main inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to use 3rd party apps to read my email. This means I want to read my email with any standards (mostly IMAP) compliant app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy stuff is not a part of my requirements. It's a nice feature to have, but it's not a blocking criterion. From the state mass surveillance perspective, I'm not going to actively implement many of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-awareness/why-opsec-is-for-everyone-part-2/&quot;&gt;opsec measures&lt;/a&gt; because they are inconvenient. From the advertisement surveillance perspective, 90% of the emails I receive are automated, so there is a marketer on the other side who is probably selling my preferences anyway. If I want to keep something really private, I don't send it through email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started looking at many email providers since last year, but not many of them fit the bill. And those that meet all the requirements are at least 50$/year. I signed up for the trial version of several, but none of them stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many providers boast that they are located in country X with strong privacy laws, but that is marketing only. Even Switzerland, which is famous for strong privacy laws, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37465853&quot;&gt;gave additional power&lt;/a&gt; to their intelligence agencies so that they could monitor the population more closely. The German intelligence agency, BND, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/nsa-spying-scandal-committee-presents-controversial-final-report/a-39453668&quot;&gt;cooperated with NSA&lt;/a&gt;: BND would spy on Americans, NSA would spy on Germans and they would exchange intel. So there is not much advantage in hosting your email in a Swiss underground bunker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the more notable email providers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tutanota&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protonmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fastmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mailbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two are very security and privacy oriented. If that's your main concern, go for it. But it comes with some inconveniences: no server side search and you can't use 3rd party apps to read your email, just the apps they provide. They have some workarounds, but they just move the problem onto your machine (they offer a bridge that you install locally and which translates their custom protocol to IMAP and does indexing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fastmail was my top choice, from a usability perspective and I read many good reviews of it. It ticks all the boxes, at a cost of 50$ per year. I evaluated it a year ago, but because the construction of my house started, I put the email migration project on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;purelymail&quot;&gt;PurelyMail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing I did that, because this year, in January, I read on Jan-Lukas Else's &lt;a href=&quot;https://jlelse.blog/links/2020/01/purelymail/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://purelymail.com/&quot;&gt;PurelyMail&lt;/a&gt;. It immediately stood out to me because it's cheap: around 10$/year, so 5 times cheaper than Fastmail. At such a low price, I signed up for it right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PurelyMail is a one man show and it offers purely email, nothing else. It meets all my requirements and then some. Email data is encrypted on disk, but it also offers full text search, with the caveat that some information can be extracted from the search index, which seems like a very reasonable trade off to me. Scott Johnson, the owner, is very friendly and answered the support channel very quickly when I had some questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the low price, PurelyMail has one more awesome thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://purelymail.com/advancedpricing&quot;&gt;you pay for storage, not for users&lt;/a&gt;. So if you have a custom domain, you can create as many users as you want and you won't pay extra. All you will pay for is the total storage (and number of emails sent/received). All the other providers I saw charged extra for different addresses. They even had limitations on the number of aliases you could create for one user. But with PurelyMail, I can create an account for my wife, an account to use for sending automated mails from my servers (for monitoring) and accounts for many other things and not pay anything extra. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up PurelyMail with my own domain was very easy. They have one page which shows all the information needed to set up MX, SPF, DKIM and DMARC records and validation happened almost instantly. All this is needed so that other email providers know that the emails really came from someone somehow related to the domain and it's not just spammers spoofing your domain. I tested this by sending out emails to several other addresses I own and they all got the mail, except for my Hotmail address. There, I first had to send an email from the Hotmail account to my own domain email address and then replies were received by the Hotmail account too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/04/image.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;PurelyMail default web interface
&lt;p&gt;The web interface is based on RoundCube with a custom skin. UX wise it's decent and load times are faster than GMail :) One thing that I miss is the fact that in GMail folders are actually labels and you can have multiple labels for an email. However, I believe this is more of a limitation of the IMAP protocol, so it's not purely PurelyMail's fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation on Android is a bit worse. The recommended FOSS email client is FairEmail, whose UX sucks. Sometimes I still can't figure out how to check the details for an email and finding the forward button takes too long. So I cheat and have both FairEmail and the GMail app connected to my PurelyMail account. If I can't do something in FairEmail, I open the account in GMail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability wise, during the last three months I noticed only one outage (which happened while I was writing this post :) ), during which load times increased 10x. Otherwise the service has been stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;incremental-switching&quot;&gt;Incremental switching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 11 years that GMail has been my main email account I have signed up for many online services with it. Logging in to all of them and changing the email address would take a long time. So I am taking an incremental approach: when I get a new email on my old account, I try to switch it to the new account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of this method is that I don't have to spend a lot of time at once updating accounts and I might actually never waste time trying to change websites that don't send me emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, I also review many of my accounts and I've decided to delete some of them and I've unsubscribed from many newsletters that were irrelevant. But I also discovered some oddities about some sites are: for example, Withings has one email address for the user account and another one for the user profile. I updated the first one, but then I still received weekly updates on my old email address. Similarly, The Atlantic confirmed my change of email address for my account, but I still receive their newsletter on the old address, because that's a separate thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will still be checking out my GMail account for a while, but I'm glad that I've successfully convinced my main personal contact to send me emails to my domain: dad. The rest will follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Moving away from GMail</og:title>
<og:description>tl;dr: I like PurelyMail and I will slowly switch all my online accounts to use it. I've been using it for almost three months and I didn't have any issues (except with some Hotmail/Outlook addresses). I have a GMail account since 2006 (that's the date of the first</og:description>
