<title>BlackRock’s decision to dump coal signals what’s next</title>
<link>https://theconversation.com/blackrock-is-the-canary-in-the-coalmine-its-decision-to-dump-coal-signals-whats-next-129972</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The announcement by BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, that it will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/politics/adani-to-selffund-2b-carmichael-mine-construction-to-start-before-christmas-20181129-h18i91&quot;&gt;dump&lt;/a&gt; more than half a billion dollars in thermal coal shares from all of its actively managed portfolios, might not seem like big news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcements of this kind have come out steadily over the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually all the major Australian and European banks and insurers, and many other global institutions, have already announced such policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://unfriendcoal.com/2019scorecard/&quot;&gt;Unfriend Coal Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, insurance companies have stopped covering roughly US$8.9 trillion of coal investments – more than one-third (37%) of the coal industry’s global assets, and stopped offering reinsurance to 46% of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blackrock matters because it is big&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement matters, in part because of Blackrock’s sheer size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s largest investor, with a total of $US7 trillion in funds under its control. Its announcement it will “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter&quot;&gt;put climate change at the center of its investment strategy&lt;/a&gt;” raises questions about the soundness of smaller financial institutions that remain committed to coal and to a carbon-based economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip&quot; srcset=&quot;https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=273&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=273&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=273&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=343&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=343&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/310194/original/file-20200115-151867-1u0euws.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=343&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;source&quot; href=&quot;https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/blackrock-client-letter&quot;&gt;Exract from BlackRock's letter to clients, January 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackrock is also important because its primary business is index funds, that are meant to replicate entire markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far these funds are not affected by the divestment policy. BlackRock’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/298415/ishares-s-p-500-index-fund&quot;&gt;iShares United States S&amp;amp;P 500 Index fund&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, has nearly US$23 billion in assets, including as much as US$1 billion in energy investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the contradiction between the company’s new activist stance and the passive replication of an energy-heavy index such as Australia’s is obvious. The pressure to find a solution will grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In time, the entire share market will be affected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution might be for large mining companies such as BHP to dump their coal assets in order to remain part of both Blackrock’s actively managed (stock picking) and passively managed (all stocks) portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another might be the development of index funds from which firms reliant on fossil fuels are excluded. It is even possible that the compilers of stock market indexes will themselves exclude these firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement has big implications for the Australian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;http://theconversation.com/fossil-fuel-campaigners-win-support-from-unexpected-places-19394&quot;&gt;Fossil fuel campaigners win support from unexpected places&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackrock chief executive Laurence Fink noted that climate change has become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/climate-change-will-reshape-finance-world-s-largest-fund-manager-says-20200115-p53rix.html&quot;&gt;top issue raised by clients&lt;/a&gt;. He said it would soon affect all all investments – everything from municipal bonds to mortgages for homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once investors start assessing government bonds in terms of climate change, Australia’s government will be in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Australia’s AAA rating will be at risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bushfire catastrophe and the government’s inadequate response have shown the world Australia is both among the countries most exposed to climate catastrophe and one of the worst in terms of contributions to solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once bond investors follow the lead of Blackrock and other financial institutions, divestment of Australian government bonds will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process has already started, with the decision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/climate-change-why-swedens-central-bank-dumped-australian-bonds-126766&quot;&gt;Sweden’s central bank&lt;/a&gt; to unload its holdings of Australian government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken in isolation, Sweden’s move had virtually no effect on Australia’s bond prices and yields. But the most striking feature of the divestment movement so far is the speed with which it has grown from symbolic gestures to a severe constraint on funding for the firms it touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;http://theconversation.com/climate-change-why-swedens-central-bank-dumped-australian-bonds-126766&quot;&gt;Climate change: why Sweden's central bank dumped Australian bonds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Adani corporation was unable to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/politics/adani-to-selffund-2b-carmichael-mine-construction-to-start-before-christmas-20181129-h18i91&quot;&gt;a single bank willing to fund its Carmichael mine&lt;/a&gt; is an indication of the pressure that will come to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects might be felt before large-scale divestment takes place. Ratings agencies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moodys.com/Pages/default_au.aspx&quot;&gt;Moody’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_AU/home?idro=14&quot;&gt;Standard and Poors&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to anticipate risks to bondholders before they materialise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’ll make inaction expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there is a serious threat of large-scale divestment in Australian bonds, the agencies will be obliged to take this into account in setting Ausralia’s credit rating. The much-prized AAA rating is likely to be an early casualty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would mean higher interest rates for Australian government bonds which would flow through the entire economy, including the home mortgage rates mentioned in the Blackrock statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s case for doing nothing about climate change (other than cashing in on past efforts) has been premised on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/morrison-backs-coal-despite-blackrock-signalling-retreat-from-fossil-fuels-20200115-p53rqe.html&quot;&gt;economy-wrecking&lt;/a&gt;” costs of serious action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as investments associated with coal are increasingly seen as toxic, we run an increasing risk that inaction will cause greater damage.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Back pain is a problem which is badly treated</title>

His doctor in Romford, an English town, referred him to hospital for an &lt;small&gt;MRI&lt;/small&gt; scan; this showed that some of the spongelike discs that separate the spine’s vertebrae were bulging out of the slots into which they customarily fit. Such “slipped” discs can be caused by an injury; but they are also the sort of thing which can just happen with increasing age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Mr Moore received a prescription for opioids to help him cope with the pain; but the pain persisted, and he found himself becoming loopy. Unable to work or do much else, Mr Moore, who had been a painter, sank into depression. Three years into his ordeal, he says, he was “thinking of ending it all”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Back pain does not, in and of itself, kill people. But it makes a huge number of lives a misery. In most countries for which there are reliable figures, whether rich or poor, back pain is the top cause of disability, measured by the aggregate number of years lived in poor health. That burden is decreasing (see chart) but only very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;The costs, however, have been rising quite quickly—and are enormous. In 2013, according to one study, $88bn was spent on medical treatments for back and neck pain in America, not far short of the $115bn spent on cancer (more recent figures have not been analysed in a comparable way). A great deal of this money seems, sadly, to do little good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Doctors used to think that back pain was almost entirely the result of mechanical damage to tissue beyond the capacity of &lt;small&gt;X&lt;/small&gt;-rays to detect. The advent of &lt;small&gt;MRI&lt;/small&gt; scans showed this was not true. A definitive physical cause—such as a fracture, a tumour, pressure on a nerve, infection or arthritis—is found in 5-15% of people with back pain. The rest is all labelled as “non-specific”, and there is increasing evidence that it is not mechanical in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Back pain, like all pain, is experienced in the brain not the body; nerves coming in tell the brain that something is amiss, and the brain projects an appropriate sensation of pain. Researchers who specialise in pain increasingly believe that, in most cases, chronic pain means that the system has become damaged in some way that keeps it switched on. “It’s like a fire alarm that goes off after the fire has been extinguished,” says Lucie Knight, a psychologist at a pain clinic in St Thomas’ Hospital, in London. Back pain may also be related to other aspects of a person’s life not going well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Taking this view seriously throws into doubt a great deal of the medical treatment of back pain—much of which, in effect, seeks to silence the maddening sound of the fire alarm by putting out a fire that isn’t there. But it does not offer an obvious medical alternative. Some pain medicines, such as paracetamol, do not work at all for back pain. Opioids, for all their reputed analgesic potency, offer back-pain relief little if any better than options such as ibuprofen. Their continued use often makes pain worse rather than better, and is highly likely to cause addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Drugs that worked better and did less harm would be a boon. But they have proved hard to develop. The mechanisms in the nervous system and brain which generate pain are complex, and can doubtless go wrong in a variety of ways, says Steve McMahon of King’s College London. He thinks that the development of drugs for chronic pain has a poor record because the people they are tried on have a range of different problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Evidence of ineffectiveness has not stopped doctors from writing prescriptions for the drugs they have. The prevalence of chronic back pain provided a huge expanse of fertile ground for the deceptive marketing and poor prescription behind America’s opioid epidemic (see &lt;a data-tegid=&quot;fhfi84rh9hm7nmbnrb0nq2bs3tjnd9l0&quot; href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/business/2020/01/18/the-wider-effects-of-americas-opioid-epidemic&quot;&gt;Bartleby&lt;/a&gt;). In many countries doctors also frequently prescribe painkillers called gabapentinoids, despite strong evidence from trials that, as far as treating back pain goes, they offer no benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;There are also a lot of treatments for the back itself. Spines are injected with cement-like mixtures or fitted with various types of medical hardware. Vertebrae are fused together, discs excised or tampered with in various ways. Yet—unsurprisingly, if it is largely the pain mechanism which is the problem—there is a growing body of evidence that the benefits all this offers to most patients are limited or non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Even just looking at the back causes problems. Only 1-5% of people with back pain have a problem that requires urgent treatment, such as an infection or a tumour; in such cases the pain will tend to be accompanied by other symptoms too, such as weight loss, fever or incontinence. In America and western Europe guidelines say that it is only when such red flags are present that a patient presenting with back pain should promptly be given an x-ray or an &lt;small&gt;MRI&lt;/small&gt; scan. Yet general practitioners and hospitals routinely ignore this, sending 40-60% of people with back pain to be scanned—far more than they did 20 years ago. According to Jan Hartvigsen of the University of Southern Denmark there is a broad consensus that about 80% of such scans are useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;That might be fine if the scans were sometimes helpful and never harmful. But few bodies are completely normal, and learning of your particular “abnormalities” in a medical setting and while suffering is alarming even if a healthy back might look just as odd. Disc “degeneration” is seen in roughly half of young and middle-aged adults with back pain, but also in a third of those with no pain at all. Some 40% of people with back pain have disc protrusion, a form of “slipped” disc; but so do nearly 20% of people who are pain-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Both patients and doctors, though, tend to think that if they can see something they should do something. Some sufferers catastrophise the news into the idea that they have a broken, fragile back and start avoiding normal physical activity—not least, says Ms Knight of St Thomas’, because doctors often fail to explain to them that abnormalities are, in fact, quite normal, and that degeneration can basically be wear and tear. The stiffness and weakening of the muscles this inactivity brings often makes things worse. And doctors may take abnormalities as a cue for further medical attention. Many studies have confirmed that patients who receive unwarranted imaging in the first few weeks of back pain are more likely to have surgery and unnecessary follow-up tests than similar patients spared the scans—but that they enjoy no benefits in terms of pain reduction or lessened disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In 2011 Cigna, an American insurance company, ran a follow-up study on patients who had undergone procedures in which vertebrae are stitched together with implanted bolts and braces. “Spinal fusion” of this type is a frequently used surgical response to back pain that is associated with the degeneration of spinal discs; in 2015 there were roughly 85,000 such surgeries in America. The company found that two years after treatment 87% of customers were still in pain severe enough for medication or some other treatment; 15% had more surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is going to hurt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;It all sounds depressing. It need not be so. There are ways of dealing with back pain that waste much less money and leave patients less distressed and with a greater sense of their own agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Mr Moore, the patient with whom this story began, tried to come to terms with his disabling pain by starting a support group for fellow sufferers. A psychologist from St Thomas’, which has the biggest pain clinic in Europe, came to talk to them about “graded exercise” and the importance of pacing themselves when going out and about. “Nobody had told me I could do these things,” says Mr Moore. In 1996, three years after back pain had come to dominate his existence, a two-week residential programme at the pain clinic taught him what it teaches people today: exercise daily; accept flare-ups as temporary setbacks; don’t get fixated on the pain. Learning to keep going this way “saved my life”, Mr Moore says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;The programme, explains Ms Knight, aims not to reduce pain so much as to add to life. People naturally struggle against the pain, which means they are burdened with the pain and the struggle too. “If you can drop the struggle,” says Ms Knight, “then you have your hands free to do more.” Patients are taught how to gradually overcome their fears of exercise and daily activities that can cause some pain. The goals that they start with can be as simple as calling a friend and meeting for a coffee, or attending a wedding. In a typical class of ten people, Ms Knight says, one or two decide that the approach is not what they want, and may drop out. Most of them take away at least some skills which add to their quality of life. One or two, like Mr Moore, find the programme life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Various countries have tried to encourage people with back pain to stay active, with promising effects. One such campaign, in Australia, is reckoned to have led to a 15% reduction in the number of doctor visits for back pain and a 20% decrease in related medical costs. Such campaigns appear to work best when they provide practical advice on how to stay active and at work despite the pain, and when as well as speaking to the afflicted they enroll employers, clinicians and unions as partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Activity is not a panacea, and if leading an active life with pain is better than withdrawing from the world, it is still not ideal. But interventions like this seem to offer people more succour than highly medicalised approaches. Unfortunately, medical schools, patient expectations and the policies of insurers and governments all sustain the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;All around the world, family doctors are woefully undertrained to treat common, unglamorous conditions such as bad backs. In most medical curricula musculoskeletal conditions, like back pain, are a minor feature. Back pain is “not sexy” for medical students, says Chris Maher of the University of Sydney. Even if they are going to be family doctors they still want to hear about cures for cancer and impressive forms of surgery, rather than humdrum stuff like back pain or preventing falls in older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Spinal surgeons, for their part, often take a dim view of evidence that what they do may be ineffective. Surgical training is based on an apprenticeship model. “You learn from a master, a great guru, and you do what they taught you. You don’t learn from a paper in the &lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; says Andrew Carr, who heads the department of orthopaedic surgery at Oxford University. Surgeons generally consider an operation successful if the incision is small, things heal nicely and there are no complications, says Maurits van Tulder from Vrije University in Amsterdam. If they ever hear back from patients, that is usually from those for whom the operation worked—which leads surgeons to believe that it works most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Though research on surgical outcomes is becoming a lot more widespread, it is still hard to convince surgeons that what they have been doing for most of their careers is ineffective, says Dr Carr. It is also hard to convince patients that, when it comes to treatment, less may be more. Told that the best thing they can do about back pain is exercise their body and their patience, they often think they are being fobbed off; a deluge of online marketing for ineffective treatments does not help. Some harangue their doctors for scans or injections, or find a new more biddable one. For a busy doctor, says Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Australia, “it’s easier to prescribe an x-ray than explain why you don’t need one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Once pain becomes chronic, persuading sufferers that the cause is not a fixable physical defect becomes much harder. Graeme Wilkes, a British doctor, says that he might spend an hour telling a patient that the things seen on his &lt;small&gt;MRI&lt;/small&gt; may not be the reasons for his back pain, and that a spinal injection is unlikely to help. “The reason they’ve got back pain is that they have financial problems, marital problems, disabled children, they are not sleeping at night—not those changes in their &lt;small&gt;MRI&lt;/small&gt; scan,” says Dr Wilkes. “And they go home and someone says ‘Oh, that’s absolute rubbish that you can’t get an injection, because my mate at work had it and he was much better afterwards. Don’t listen to them, go back to your &lt;small&gt;GP&lt;/small&gt; and get referred’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;But the biggest reason why so many people with back pain get the wrong treatments is that governments and insurance plans pay for them. In America, Australia and the Netherlands health plans pay for back operations that cost $25,000-100,000 apiece. American plans often support the alternative therapy offered by chiropractors. There is some evidence that this may do some good in back pain, but the research is patchy and any benefits small and short-lived. Yet the same plans typically offer little support for physiotherapy to the same end. If a therapy has been accepted by an insurance company, or a government scheme like America’s Medicare, it is very hard to get it removed, even if evidence for effectiveness persistently fails to turn up. “Once they are in, it is hard to take them out,” says Dan Cherkin from the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. The manufacturers of medical devices are very good at lobbying to get them covered as treatments. They are also “incredibly effective” in marketing their wares to doctors, says Richard Deyo of Oregon Health and Science University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Back pain is big business for many surgeons, doctors and chiropractors. “If we stop doing low-value care, some entire professions have to change fundamentally what they do,” says Lorimer Moseley of the University of South Australia after enumerating a long list of ineffective treatments. In some systems cupidity encourages such things. In America, where procedures are more lucrative than talking to patients, an unscrupulous doctor might prefer to spend a 15-minute appointment giving a patient an injection rather than some education, just as a harried one might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Other countries have had some success with an approach called “Choosing Wisely”, in which doctors explain to patients the evidence on the effectiveness of various treatment options and decide together what is best given each patient’s personal goals (which could range from simply wanting to be able to play with their grandchildren to cycling or running). In Britain there has been a determined move towards triage which assigns back-pain patients to more or less intensive treatment depending on the complexity of their problems. In Australia some emergency rooms have started sending some back-pain patients brought in by ambulance straight to physiotherapists, which avoids a significant amount of hospitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Choosing poorly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;But when professional associations in America urged doctors to take up the Choosing Wisely model their campaign made almost no difference to back-pain treatment—perhaps because doctors were under no obligation to change, says Dr Deyo. Nor has a change in the advice provided by the American College of Physicians had any great effect as yet. In 2017 the college stopped recommending medication as an initial response to back pain, suggesting instead acupuncture, yoga, tai-chi and psychological therapies aimed at reducing stress, all of which have been shown to reduce pain-related disability. Insurers have taken note, with some now covering some or more of these alternatives. That will make it easier for doctors moved to change their practice to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Another approach might be to nudge doctors incrementally, rather than to change their practices once and for all. Tweaking the interface of the electronic systems doctors use to order &lt;small&gt;MRI&lt;/small&gt;s so that it takes them longer to place an order has been shown to reduce the number of unnecessary scans. Adding a pop-up reminder explaining why imaging is frequently unnecessary has also shown effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Disability-benefit systems matter a lot, too. In many countries benefit systems give people signed off with back pain few incentives to improve, and their erstwhile employers no incentive to encourage them back rather than find someone else. In the Netherlands, though, this has changed. Medical assessment for disability benefits does not kick in for two years after a patient reports sick, and during this time employers must pay the sick employee 70-100% of their wages. Employers and employees are also required by law to agree a return-to-work plan. After the country switched to this system, in 2006, the total number of sick days for back pain fell by a third. The return-to-work rate after a three-to-four-month sick leave due to back pain is now 62% in the Netherlands. In neighbouring Germany it is only 22%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Drivers for such change are hard to come by in part because, as Dr Maher says, back pain is largely invisible. People do not die from it and there are no “back-pain survivors” to spearhead lapel-ribbon campaigns for change. Few national medical plans even mention back pain. Sufferers are often viewed as impostors, or told that it is all in their heads. Though other aspects of a patient’s life do impede recovery from back pain, many people cannot easily take control over the context of their life, still less the content of their heads. The lack of a lobby accounts in part for the absence of more impressive projects to move beyond medical devices and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;In 2018 Dr Buchbinder was one of the authors of a series of studies on back pain published in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; which they pitched to the journal in the hope that summarising the debacle in rich countries would warn developing countries not to follow suit. But when the researchers began to compile the data, she says, they discovered that in poor countries the horse had already bolted. In India, Brazil, China, Nepal, Iran and other developing countries doctors are already prescribing drugs, injections and &lt;small&gt;X&lt;/small&gt;-rays for simple back pain. In some urban areas of India and Africa opioids can be easily bought from the roadside chemists where many poor people go first for aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;Mr Moore, for his part, has not taken pain medication since 1997. To keep his pain at a manageable level, he starts his day with stretching at home for half an hour, followed by an hour and a half at the gym. And he leads a full life.&lt;span data-ornament=&quot;ufinish&quot;&gt;■&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__body-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction (January 16th 2020): An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Mr Moore’s doctor was in Peterborough and that he was given steroid injections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Christopher Tolkien has died</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/16/jrr-tolkiens-son-christopher-dies-aged-95</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/16/jrr-tolkiens-son-christopher-dies-aged-95</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Tolkien, the son of Lord Of The Rings author &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/jrrtolkien&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;JRR Tolkien&lt;/a&gt;, has died aged 95, the Tolkien Society has announced. The society, which promotes the life and works of the celebrated writer, released a short statement on Twitter to confirm the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement said: “Christopher Tolkien has died at the age of 95. The Tolkien Society sends its deepest condolences to Baillie, Simon, Adam, Rachel and the whole Tolkien family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolkien, who was born in Leeds in 1924, was the third and youngest son of the revered fantasy author and his wife Edith. He grew up listening to his father’s tales of Bilbo Baggins, which later became the children’s fantasy novel, The Hobbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He drew many of the original maps detailing the world of Middle-earth for his father’s The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/lord-of-the-rings&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt; when the series was first published between 1954 and 55. He also edited much of his father’s posthumously published work following his death in 1973. Since 1975 he had lived in France with Baillie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolkien Society chairman Shaun Gunner praised Christopher’s commitment to his father’s work and said: “Millions of people around the world will be forever grateful to him … We have lost a titan and he will be sorely missed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Redmayne, chief executive of HarperCollins UK, which publishes much of JRR Tolkien’s work, said: “Christopher was a devoted curator of his father’s work and the timeless and ongoing popularity of the world that JRR Tolkien created is a fitting testimony to the decades he spent bringing Middle-Earth to generations of readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[He was] the most charming of men, and a true gentleman. It was an honour and privilege to know and work with him and our thoughts are with his family at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolkien scholar Dimitra Fimi hailed Christopher for enriching his father’s work. She said: “He gave us a window into Tolkien’s creative process, and he provided scholarly commentary that enriched our understanding of Middle-earth. He was Middle-earth’s cartographer and first scholar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/24/simon-tolkien-jrr-tolkien-hobbit&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;In an interview with the Guardian in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Christopher’s son Simon described the enormity of the task after his grandfather died with so much material still unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon said: “He had produced this huge output that covered everything from the history of the gods to the history of the people he called the Silmarils – that was his great work, but it had never seen the light of day despite his best efforts to get it published.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His son was left to sift through the files and notebooks, and over the two decades after his father’s death, he published The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Beren And Lúthien and The History of Middle-earth, which fleshed out the complex world of elves and dwarves created by his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s enormously to my father’s credit that he took on that huge task. I remember the crateloads of papers arriving at his home, and no one could be in any doubt at the scale of the work he had taken on,” Simon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he worked tirelessly to protect his father’s legacy, he was not impressed by what he saw as the commercialisation of his work. He was famously critical of Peter Jackson’s Oscar-winning film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. In a 2012 interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, he said: “They gutted the book, making an action film for 15-to-25-year-olds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said: “Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed by the absurdity of our time,” and that “the commercialisation has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing”.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Parachuting for Charity: A 5-year audit (1999)</title>
<link>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10476298</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10476298</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;All parachute injuries from two local parachute centres over a 5-year period were analysed. Of 174 patients with injuries of varying severity, 94% were first-time charity-parachutists. The injury rate in charity-parachutists was 11% at an average cost of 3751 Pounds per casualty. Sixty-three percent of casualties who were charity-parachutists required hospital admission, representing a serious injury rate of 7%, at an average cost of 5781 Pounds per patient. The amount raised per person for charity was 30 Pounds. Each pound raised for charity cost the NHS 13.75 Pounds in return. Parachuting for charity costs more money than it raises, carries a high risk of serious personal injury and places a significant burden on health resources.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Adult site leaks data of cam models</title>
<link>https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-pussycash-leak/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-pussycash-leak/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The vpnMentor cybersecurity research team, led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, have uncovered a leaking S3 Bucket with 19.95GB of visible data on a Virginia-based Amazon server, belonging to PussyCash and its network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PussyCash is an explicit ‘cam’ affiliate network that owns the brand ImLive and other similar adult-oriented websites. This leak has exposed the personal data and likeness of over 4,000 models among more than 875,000 files and has high-risk, real life implications for said models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PussyCash Company Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of ImLive and PussyCash is officially listed as I.M.L. SLU, a company registered in Andorra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PussyCash hosts affiliation programs for multiple adult sites, paying webmasters for traffic sent to the sites through banners and exit traffic. They boast 66 million registered members on their webcam chat arena, ImLive, alone. Other sites include Sexier.com, FetishGalaxy, Supermen.com, Shemale.com, CamsCreative.center, forgetvanilla.com, idesires.com, Phonemates.com, SuperTrip.com, and sex.sex, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners listed on the PussyCash website include BeNaughty, Xtube, and Pornhub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Discovery and Owner Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the extent of a data breach and the owner of the data are obvious, and the issue quickly resolved. But rare are these times. &lt;strong&gt;Most often, we need days of investigation before we understand what’s at stake or who’s leaking the data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding a breach and what’s at stake takes careful attention and time. We work hard to publish accurate and trustworthy reports, ensuring everybody who reads them understands their seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some affected parties deny the facts, disregarding our research or playing down its impact. So, we need to be thorough and make sure everything we find is correct and true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the initial discovery led us to believe that the leak was limited only to a few records on an ImLive bucket alone. However, we eventually found files indicating that PussyCash is ultimately the owner of the leaking Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date discovered&lt;/strong&gt;: January 3, 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date company (PussyCash &amp;amp; ImLive) notified&lt;/strong&gt;: January 4, 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Amazon notified&lt;/strong&gt;: January 7, 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date of reply from ImLive&lt;/strong&gt;: January 7, 2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date of action&lt;/strong&gt;: January 9, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PussyCash never replied to any of our attempts to contact them regarding the data leak, including their Data Protection Officer. ImLive finally responded to one of our emails, stating that they would take care of it and pass on the information to the PussyCash tech team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As PussyCash doesn’t hire talent through their main website, it is plausible to assume that their leaking data is from one or more of their other websites, such as ImLive. This is an assumption that we cannot prove without digging further into the data leak. We also saw records specifically mentioning ImLive, which is why we have chosen to use that as an example for portions of this report, and not necessarily the other PussyCash brands and sites. However, it is worth noting that the Bucket itself is named after PussyCash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples of Entries in the Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data Impacted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least 875,000 keys, which represent different file types, including videos, marketing materials, photographs, clips and screenshots of video chats, and zip files. Within each zip folder – and there is apparently one zip folder per model – there are often multiple additional files (e.g. photographs and scans of documents), and many additional items that we chose not to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folders included could be up to 15-20 years old, but are also as recent as the last few weeks. Even for older files, given the nature of the data, it is still relevant and of equal impact as newly added files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Photographs and scans of full passports and national identification cards, including visible:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birth date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birthplace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citizenship status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nationality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passport/ID number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passport issue &amp;amp; expiration dates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nationally registered gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ID photo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal signature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parent’s full names&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Argentina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brazil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peru&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ImLive.com proclaims that they &lt;em&gt;“take great care in implementing and maintaining the security of the Services and your information” and “have put in place appropriate physical and technological safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://host.imlive.com/DataPrivacyNotice.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosts Data Privacy Notice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” ImLive includes an admittedly unexhaustive list of the data they will “collect, process, and store” during the contractual relationship with the models, which is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PERSONAL INFORMATION: &lt;em&gt;including legal name and contact information (full name, home address, phone number), date of birth, government identification numbers (driver’s license), citizenship/residency, personal status, photos and other data collection permitted or required by local law;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADDITIONAL IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION: &lt;em&gt;including any name (other than the Host’s legal name) ever used by the Host, including the Host’s maiden name, alias, nickname, stage name, or professional name; a legible hard copy or legible digitally scanned or other electronic copy of a hard copy of the identification document examined and, if that document does not contain a recent and recognizable picture of the Host, a legible hard copy of a Picture Identification Card (as this term is defined below); a copy of the depiction (including live cams or advertising) and, where the depiction is published on an Internet computer site or service, a copy of any URL associated with the depiction. If no URL is associated with the depiction, the records shall include another uniquely identifying reference associated with the location of the depiction on the Internet; and for any Host in a depiction performed live on the Internet, a copy of the depiction with running-time sufficient to identify the performer in the depiction and to associate the performer with the records needed to confirm his or her age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PICTURE IDENTIFICATION CARD: &lt;em&gt;including a document issued by either: (a) the United States, a US State government, or a political subdivision thereof, or a United States territory, that bears the photograph, the name of the individual identified, and the date of birth of the Host, and provides specific information sufficient for the issuing authority to confirm its validity, such as a passport, permanent resident card (commonly known as a “Green Card”), or employment authorization document issued by the United States, a driver’s license or other form of identification issued by a State or the District of Columbia; or (b) a foreign government-issued equivalent of any of the documents listed above when the person who is the subject of the picture identification card is a non-U.S. citizen located outside the United States at the time of original production and the producer maintaining the required records, whether a U.S. citizen or non-U.S. citizen, is located outside the United States on the original production date. The picture identification card must be valid as of the original production date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PAYMENT INFORMATION: &lt;em&gt;including bank information, garnishments and deductions, and other related information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PERFORMANCE AND TALENT INFORMATION: &lt;em&gt;including qualifications, evaluations, developmental planning, security policy permissions, communication data and other talent management and team based assessments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APPLICATIONS/RECORDS: &lt;em&gt;In addition, the Company collects and maintains different types of personal information, including the personal information contained in medical history questionnaires and evaluations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity procedures ImLive.com &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://imlive.com/privacy.aspx&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that they have implemented for their hosts’/models’ data include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure network topology, which includes intrusion prevention and Firewall systems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypted communication;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication and Access Control;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External and Internal audit tests; etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their Host’s Data Privacy Notice, they also write that to ensure “&lt;em&gt;the safety of our users’ information, and prevent unauthorized use of any such information the Company employs industry standard practices and procedures such as compliance checks to ensure the policy is being adhered, data protection impact assessments, internal audits of processing activities etc&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they “&lt;em&gt;make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise&lt;/em&gt;,” that they will prevent or be responsible for unauthorized access to the personal data they have collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Breach Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leak represents a potentially severe threat to those whose data has been exposed. It has many implications, all of which could very well ruin the lives of the models/actors involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identity theft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within nearly each zip file that our researchers discovered was everything necessary for a criminal to easily assume the identity of another. This is also information that we regularly see being sold on the dark web, often at very attractive prices. With someone’s national identity number, a scan of their photo ID, their full address, credit card number, and even their parents’ or spouse’s name, you have the full identity theft package at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the likeness of high-profile adult actors and actresses, both unethical companies and scammers can con innocent individuals out of their hard-earned money. It’s also plausible that the images and videos of any of these models could be used for catfishing on dating apps/sites to commit fraud on those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s by fraudulently using their image to promote a product or service, or even by impersonating the model and requesting money from personal connections, the threat of a scam looms with this sort of data at the fingertips of criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Public humiliation and impact on personal life/relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many individuals who make the choice to be on camera in a pornographic nature, it is their circumstances rather than their blatant desire to flaunt their nude image that leads them to such a decision. This means that in the vast majority of cases – as indicated by stage names and anonymity clauses in some contracts – that the model could potentially be devastated by being exposed to their loved ones, causing them irreparable embarrassment and distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many files we found are 10-20 years old, and it might be that since engaging in webcam model work, the individuals have moved on to build professional and personal lives outside of the adult industry. For those who have tried hard to forget and hide the past, their family, friends, and colleagues may not know about this, and it can put their current relationships in great jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blackmail and extortion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities career criminals, and individuals who hold personal grudges could all easily blackmail or extort the models by threatening to expose them, either publicly, professionally, personally, or any combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stalking by fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, live adult webcams provide an important outlet; for a few, they can become obsessed with a particular cam model and have a strong desire to meet them. There are those that would potentially follow through with this, thereby stalking the model, if they had enough information about them (such as real name, address, phone number, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stalking is a gateway to a number of additional threats, including harassment, rape, kidnap, and even homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Job loss and professional embarrassment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon discovery of a ‘side hustle’ or past full-time engagement in the adult industry, it is extremely plausible that this would pose a negative impact on the models. Threatening their jobs and professional reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exposing LGBTQ individuals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is grave danger to LGBTQ models who’d be exposed. Around the world, there are about 70 countries where homosexuality is still criminalized – for example, up to 21 years imprisonment in Kenya. In many others, same-sex relations are seen as taboo and repugnant by a significant percentage of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many gay males and trans individuals are harassed by police, extorted, and blackmailed for bribes and sexual favors in exchange for freedom/security. Those who don’t comply are frequently charged with trumped-up charges and sometimes raped instead. Because of this leak, their address is clearly made available – along with other PII – that puts them directly at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Legal repercussions (depending on location)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pornography laws can vary greatly by region. Approximately 30 countries ban internet porn entirely and nearly 80 ban the sale or distribution of porn. Penalties for violating these bans include various amounts of fines and jail time. Some more traditional societies are a given here, but there are also a few countries where it’s surprising that anti-porn laws still exist (such as Australia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breach of contract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exposing a model’s real name and details – and also connecting it with their stage name – it is possible that the company and even talent agencies are in breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Human rights and dignity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much that could be discussed in the way of human rights and human dignity in the adult industry. Is it reasonable to consider that it is belittling of models/hosts/actors from developing nations to require that they take pics of themselves next to two forms of identification? It’s also worth noting that much of the PII was not redacted by agencies, who apparently provided/transferred at least some of these documents and photos to PussyCash and/or its affiliated websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the models live in or come from countries that are at more of an economical disadvantage. Their socioeconomic status may be, at least in part, a motive in choosing a traditionally taboo occupation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can give thought to the inherent psychological impact a data leak in this particular industry might carry. What might the reaction of the models whose personally identifying information, documents, photos, and videos be? It is important to note that we produce these reports of our findings for the sake of bringing awareness to the importance of safeguarding your own data, and for companies to take seriously the implications of cyber and information security threats. We cannot recommend enough that if you are in a circumstance where you need to virtually confirm your identity, that you redact as much information as possible before sending photos or scans of official documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advice from the Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PussyCash could have easily avoided this leak if they had taken some basic security measures to protect the S3 Bucket. These include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure your servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement proper access rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never leave a system that doesn’t require authentication open to the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any company can replicate the same steps, no matter its size. For a more in-depth guide on how to protect your business, check out our guide to securing your website and online database from hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How and Why We Discovered the Breach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vpnMentor research team discovered the breach in Pussycash’s database as part of a huge web mapping project. Our researchers use port scanning to examine particular IP blocks and test open holes in systems for weaknesses. They examine each hole for data being leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they find a data breach, they use expert techniques to verify the database’s identity. We then alert the company to the breach. If possible, we will also alert those affected by the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to access Pussycash’s S3 bucket because it was completely unsecured and unencrypted. Using a web browser, the team could access all files hosted on the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this web mapping project is to help make the internet safer for all users. As ethical hackers, we’re obliged to inform a company when we discover flaws in their online security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these ethics also mean we also carry a responsibility to the public. This is especially true when the companies data breach contains such a huge amount of private and sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About Us and Previous Reports&lt;/h2&gt;

Our research lab is a pro bono service that strives to help the online community defend itself against cyber threats while educating organizations on protecting their users’ data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we’ve discovered a breach in LightInTheBox that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-lightinthebox-leak/&quot;&gt;compromised the data of its customers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We also recently revealed that a company owned by major hotel chain AccorHotels &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-accorhotels-leak/&quot;&gt;exposed over 1TB of guests’ data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Images are all processed &lt;strong&gt;on-device&lt;/strong&gt; and nothing is sent to any server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tested to work with &lt;strong&gt;thousands of images&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best and most &lt;strong&gt;performant OCR technology&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screenshot-hero/id1493170794?ls=1&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;120&quot; src=&quot;https://asadmemon.com/projects/screenshothero/badge.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-details&quot;&gt;Technical Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to build a simple utility app that would run OCR through my photos (all 5000+ of them) and make them searchable. I had following constraints for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It has to be &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;. The UI needs to be fluid even for thousands of images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All processing should happen &lt;strong&gt;on-device&lt;/strong&gt;, should not be uploading photos to a cloud service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to &lt;strong&gt;make it quick&lt;/strong&gt; (I only had a week allocated for this project).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am primarily a web developer and am not a skilled mobile developer. So I attempted this project with three different frameworks and here are my notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;swiftui&quot;&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SwiftUI is appealing as it’s a React-like framework. I wanted to learn SwiftUI but I struggled with the documentation and even writing a simple grid of photos was challenging. The community is tiny so there aren’t that many samples online either. I really wanted to use this but it was taking a bit too much of my time. Sadly, I had to ditch SwiftUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;expoio&quot;&gt;Expo.io&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expo is a React Native framework which bypasses the whole Android SDK + XCode step of making the app. It’s very easy to get started and the dev experience is great. Having written a React Native app before, I really wanted this to work. The only problem occured when I wanted to write the OCR part: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expo eject&lt;/code&gt; workflow is kinda broken. In my case, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CameraRoll&lt;/code&gt; API broke due to some unlinked native module when I tried to run it via XCode after ejecting the app. I spent a few hours fixing the native modules but that didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without ejecting, I could have gone with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js#tesseractjs&quot;&gt;Tessaract.js&lt;/a&gt; but it’s not fast enough to process thousands of images quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also isn’t a way to do background processing with Expo. I feel expo is great for simple CRUD apps for now and will fail you if your app needs a custom functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;react-native&quot;&gt;React Native&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I had to fallback to what I already knew. I copied views which I had created earlier for expo.io into a new ReactNative project. I then created a custom Swift native module which had all my business logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Methods to fetch all photos and process newer ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queue to process only N photos concurrently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage Model, went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV&quot;&gt;MKKV&lt;/a&gt; as it was quick to set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OCR, used Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision&quot;&gt;Vision API&lt;/a&gt; which is surprisingly accurate and fastest on-device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks&quot;&gt;BackgroundTasks&lt;/a&gt; to schedule photo processing for later, when the app is sent to background mid-processing (remember we may have 10,000+ photos in our queue, each photo takes ~1s to process).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that React Native is fast enough if used only for views (and maybe lightweight logic) only. I used &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FlatList&lt;/code&gt; for the grid photo view (with some optimizations to lazy load photos) and it is very smooth even for thousands of photos. Real-time searching/filtering is also really smooth. React Native also has great community support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means writing more backend code per platform, which sucks but is straight-forward. It’s still better than writing front-end for each platform and dealing with all the quirks of each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;n ej ek el em&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;o n&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Soccermatics?source=post_page-----de47c82601ad----------------------&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;David Sumpter&quot; class=&quot;r en eo ep&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*nTsDNdogYkuFWh2MxaItEQ.png&quot; width=&quot;48&quot; height=&quot;48&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;196c&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Dan Katz, licensed psychologist and psychotherapist, explains why Thomas Erikson’s success with his book&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;fy gl&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Surrounded by Idiots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;is one of the biggest pseudoscience scandals in recent history. This version was translated in to English and edited by David Sumpter, professor of mathematics at Uppsala University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;d8fc&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Over the last few years, hundreds of thousands of Swedes have spent an estimated total of more than ten million euros on a book which many of them believed contained a scientific account of human psychology, written by an expert in the area. The book’s success has led many companies and other organizations to order personality tests, from a growing number of suppliers eager to exploit the new market, and apply them on their employees. &lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Surrounded by Idiots&lt;/em&gt; has had a major impact on how Swedish people talk to each other about psychology and discuss the behaviour of those around them. Indeed, Thomas Erikson has undoubtedly had the greatest influence on the public’s interest in psychology in a generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;56ca&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the theory behind this book, and the various follow-ups, is no more than pseudoscientific nonsense. And Erikson appears to lack even basic knowledge of psychology or behavioural science. This is why we at VoF (&lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Vetenskap och Folkbildning — the Swedish Skeptics Society&lt;/em&gt;) named Thomas Erikson fraudster of the year in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5daf&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Accusing an individual of being a fraud should never be done lightly. We need to be very sure of where we stand. Here I lay out the case as to how and why Thomas Erikson books have misled so many people…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;96d9&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0381&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Suddenly you saw it everywhere. Large posters, hanging behind piled up books at the entrance to book shops, showed images of four people, shaded red, blue, green and yellow. You couldn’t miss them. They were especially prominent in airports, and as you boarded the plane it wasn’t unusual to walk past rows of seated passengers, already engrossed in the book with those four colourful figures on the front cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ca28&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Around the same time, qualified psychologists began reporting how clients were considering leaving their partners because, “I can’t possibly live with a yellow person”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0f84&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Or, that they had been tested at the Human Resources department only to be told they needed to move to another team because their “colour combination” in their current team wasn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;32f0&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;A teenage girl comes home and tells her mother, with an air of resignation, “mum, I’m a green.” She had been tested by her school counsellor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0452&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;In cafés the same discussions could be heard again and again “I am red and a little blue. What colour are you? I’m sure that you are yellow!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e86&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Around the same time, Thomas Erikson started to appear in the media. He presented himself as an expert in behaviour and communication, appearing in this role on the morning news at the Swedish national TV channel, TV4. When his follow-up book, &lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Surrounded by Psychopaths&lt;/em&gt;, was published, state broadcaster, SVT, invited him on the show “Ask a Doctor” to talk about psychopaths. A leading newspaper, &lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Aftonbladet&lt;/em&gt;, gave him a weekly column where he would answer questions about psychology. Lectures sold out across the country, despite high ticket prices, and Erikson would use them to explain how humanity could be divided in to red, yellow, blue and green personality types. Never before had one person had such a big impact on the general publics’ understanding of how and why people behave the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f58e&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Psychologists were scratching their heads. How had the Swedish nation become so infatuated with Erikson and his four colours? Some professionals recognised talk of colours from the infamous Myers-Briggs test, administered by less-respectable management consultants. It built on the mystical ideas of the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung, active at the start of the 20th century, whose theories are now mostly of historical interest. The theory of Myers-Briggs was not something modern psychologists took seriously. Since the test had been developed quite some time ago it had been the subject of extensive research and the results had revealed serious flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;23e2&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Despite the use of colours, it turned out that the “Surrounded by …” books were not based on Myers-Brigg. Instead, they built on another personality theory, the so-called DiSC model. The most noteworthy outcome of a search through the academic literature on this model was that, despite the fact that the test had been around for fifty years, there was in principle no research on whether or not it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;50d4&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;To get to the bottom of Erikson’s theory of colours, and how large parts of the Swedish population came to take it seriously, we need to look at what science can really say about personality, what we currently know about personality tests, and the ways in which the public and mass media can be fooled by pseudoscientific theories of personality. And we need to take a closer look on who Thomas Erikson really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;df80&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fy gl&quot;&gt;Personality isn’t an explanation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4953&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Before we define personality, it is useful to explain what it isn’t. Consider a friend who does something bad and then says, “I did it because my personality led me to do it”. In making this argument, our friend is essentially claiming that their personality is like a Gremlin in their head who steers their behaviour, telling them what to do. In reality, of course, the Gremlin doesn’t exist and we don’t usually accept this argument as an excuse for bad behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cfc7&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Instead of invoking Gremlins, the most reasonable and widely accepted definition of personality is &lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;behaviour of an individual which is relatively constant over time and doesn’t depend on context&lt;/em&gt; (Perugni et al, 2016). Personality isn’t a thing, like a Gremlin, it is simply a pattern of repeatable behaviour. Using this definition, the Gremlin argument becomes circular: if someone claims that their personality made them do something, we can simply counter, “Well, yes, that is the definition of personality. All you are telling me is that you behaved in the way you did because you behaved the way you did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0a0d&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;The invocation of a personality Gremlin is one example of careless thinking. Other similar mistakes are harder to spot. For example, consider a person who says, “now I understand why I have such negative thoughts, can’t get to sleep, and have difficulty getting going…I’ve got depression.” This person might believe that the explanation of her symptoms is depression, but in fact, the diagnosis of depression is just a categorisation of exactly these symptoms. There is no depression Gremlin, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ce69&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Popular psychology is often apt to make this type of mistake. About ten years ago, Mia Törnblom — a very popular Swedish motivational speaker- made a small fortune selling books about how we can improve our self-confidence. She reasoned that negative thoughts arise from having a low self-confidence. But having negative thought of oneself is exactly the definition of low self-confidence and leads to circular thinking: low self-confidence is explained by low self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dfd4&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;This mistake gets worse if “low self-confidence” is turned in to a Gremlin, as Törnblom could be said to do in her writing. She suggested that people with low self-confidence should look in the mirror and repeat the phrase “I am fantastic” over and over again. The idea is that doing this exercise would ‘encourage’ our self-confidence and allow us to do things, like talking in front of an audience, that we had previously been scared to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;208b&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;For people with negative thoughts about themselves, this type of “positive affirmation” has actually been shown to be counterproductive (Wood et al. 2009). Negative thoughts and nervousness increase when these exercises are performed. This is a clear example of how well-meaning advice from someone without education and experience in psychology can lead to negative outcomes. Practicing psychologists are still asked by clients to ‘cure’ their confidence problems in this way. If only it was as simple as repeating a mantra…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e789&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;In summary, terms like “depression” or “low-self-confidence” are useful labels, but they are not explanations. Using them as such is akin to saying that bad weather causes it to rain. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6c98&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;even if we could identify people as red, blue, green and yellow types then the colours wouldn’t explain anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;edfd&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fy gl&quot;&gt;We do have different personalities, though, don’t we?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e0fc&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Modern evidence-based methods in behavioural science adopt the ground principle that people’s behaviour mainly depend on context. A child might be shy among her classmates at school, but suddenly take a central role when surrounded by friends in her football team. An outgoing person can quieten when he realises that no-one is paying him any attention. These basic facts, which we are all aware of, mean that psychologists are very careful when using the term personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3b89&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Accepting these limitations, there have been many scientific attempts to classify different personality types. These stretch from over two thousand years ago, when Hippocrates, classified four types of temperament (sanguine, choleric, melancholic, and phlegmatic) to the work of Jung at the beginning of the twentieth century. But it wasn’t until the 1980’s and 90’s and the model that is now known as “The Big Five” that these attempts became grounded in a proper scientific framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d7cc&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;The “Big Five” didn’t come from a theory but through statistical analysis of thousands of personality questionnaires consisting of hundreds of questions. These reveal five properties that are relatively constant over time: Openness, Consciousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. These don’t classify people as distinct types — -people can range from being very agreeable to very disagreeable with the vast majority lying somewhere near to the middle — -and the properties are not mutually exclusive — -very open people can also be conscientious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2d20&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;In summary, The Big Five is a useful way of summarizing statistical differences in human behavior, but even the psychologists who developed these tests are very careful when classifying people according to the big five (Sjöberg, 2010). Yes, we do have different tendencies in how we behave, but they are only a small part of explaining who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b96c&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fy gl&quot;&gt;Is there a scientific basis for the colour theory in surrounded by idiots?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0d12&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;The back cover of Eriksons’s book claims that “using a scientific background […] this book gives a concrete way of understanding the most important differences between different communication styles”. So what exactly is this supposed scientific background?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c95f&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Almost the only “scientific” reference that Erikson provides in his book is from a book written in 1928 called the &lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Emotions of Normal People&lt;/em&gt;, by American psychologist William Moulton Marston. Moulton hypothesised that our behaviour is influenced by “psychonic energy” that is transferred through a web of nerve cells that he called “psychons”. The four personality types (yellow, green, blue and red) arise, Marston claims, as variations between different people in the structure of their psychonic network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b915&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;This “theory” is pure speculation on the part of Marston. There was no scientific evidence for psychons or psychonic energy in 1928 and there is none today. At the time of publication, the science of psychology was in its infancy and, like Hippocrates and Jung before him, he had created a theory without proper scientific grounding. Unlike Hippocrates and Jung though, Marston’s theory garnered little attention, and he left psychology. He later rose to fame though when he created the comic book hero Wonder Woman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dd3e&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;There was however one person who followed up on Marston’s writings. In 1956 Walter Clark decided to invent a personality test based on the four-colour model. This test was further developed and is now called the DiSC model. It was later marketed as a tool for businesses to understand their employees. According to the DiSC test, humanity can be divided in to four basic types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ad3e&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;· Red: dominant, driven, solution focussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;75c1&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;· Blue: analytic, careful, meticulous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0118&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;· Green: patient, considerate, nice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dd88&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;· Yellow: extroverted, creative, verbal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;237d&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;This is all very well, but despite the fact that this test has existed for over fifty years and is quite widely spread there is no scientific study published about it. Even according to the test’s representative in Sweden, the Institute for personal development or IPU, no scientific articles have been published about the test. This means we have no way of knowing if people give consistent answers to the questions over weeks or months. Nor do we have any way of knowing if, for example, a person who answers indicate they are red are in fact dominant or driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;482a&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Erikson’s description of his own results in the test are, at best, contradictory. He says “people can be many colours!”. He later claims, without any evidence, that “80% have two colours!”. And about himself he says, “I have three colours: red, blue and yellow!”. Given the stated aim of the test to classify personalities such claims are bizarre. Indeed, by studying in more detail what the colours are meant to say about a person, my colleague Urban Fagerholm, found that Erikson must, based on his own claims, be both fast and slow in his reactions; both maximally and minimally interested in relations; and both careful and impulsive. Moreover, his lack of greenness implies that Erikson lacks patience, calm, stability, kindness and many other basic characteristics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;58f8&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;In summary, the four-colour model is based on a theory that has no scientific basis, has been subject to no rigorous testing and gives confusing and contradictory results. It is, quite simply, pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7e1d&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fy gl&quot;&gt;How does a colour theory effect workplace communication and conflicts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;32d9&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Erikson has repeatedly claimed that the benefit of his colour approach is that it helps us understand ourselves and others and, as a result, improves our communication and reduces conflicts. This is his argument as to why companies and organisations should adopt his approach. Since there is no scientific support for the four colours, there is naturally no support for this claim either. It is however useful to consider what might happen, based on research, were his colour theory to be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7b74&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;A common mistake when problems occur within an organisation is to focus on the individuals that are involved in conflicts. In fact, since it is the context of a situation which decides how people act, the primary concern in addressing any conflict should lie in how the organisation works. Before an organisation consultant, brought in to resolve conflicts, looks at individuals she should look at the structure (Olofsson &amp;amp; Nilsson, 2015). How are decisions taken? And how are employees informed of decisions made? How is responsibility shared? Which behaviour is rewarded or punished and in what ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7338&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;It is, unfortunately, often the case that companies send ‘defective’ employees away to learn “how to handle stress”, when in fact the stress is a completely reasonable response to the structural problems in an organisation. This is another example of the circular argument we described above, where the stressed employee is identified as the cause of the problem, her mythical Gremlin is to be exorcized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bc3e&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;If Erikson’s personality theory did work (which it doesn’t) then it would encourage this type of mistake: someone who acts in a certain way would be seen in terms of their colour and the reasons for any problems would be ignored. It is difficult to imagine a more unpleasant and unfair way of dealing with a problem than simply attributing it to the fact that the person in the centre of a conflict “is blue”. Naturally, some problems can arise through personal conflicts both in the workplace and within the family, but the solution is communication between all parities, not a reliance on personality theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5fc4&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Maybe the only positive thing that can be said about Erikson’s theory is that it might help some people realise that not everyone thinks the same way they do. Psychologists call this “theory of mind”, an ability to change perspective, which usually develops in early childhood. In other words, Erikson’s book might help someone with the empathetic and intellectual level of a five-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b2a1&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fy gl&quot;&gt;Is Erikson an authority in behavioural science?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;57a3&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;In the translation of his books from Swedish to other languages, Erikson is described as a behavioural scientist. In interviews he calls himself a “behavioural expert” and “expert in communication”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d111&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;When myself and my colleagues started this investigation, the first thing we did was try to establish his academic and professional credentials. We contacted his company “Team Communications” and after three emails we received an answer from Christina who first said that she “didn’t understand” the question about his education, then later said that Thomas Erikson would answer himself “when he has time”. An answer never came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2de6&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;It turned out that Christina was in fact Erikson’s wife, which only served to increase our interest. So, we used Ladok, the register of everyone who has studied at Swedish colleges and university, to see if we could find the courses taken by Erikson. There was no-one with his name and birthdate registered. In fact, Erikson’s professional background is in sales, first for the bank Nordea and then running his own business training salespeople. It is most likely that his only educational background is, at best, the Swedish equivalent of a high school diploma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;803c&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;According to Sune Gellberg, the owner of IPU, the organisation in Sweden which sell the DiSC test, no qualifications are required to carry out personality tests. “I don’t know what education our consultants have because it doesn’t matter”, he told us, “It is a computer program that does the personality analysis and gives the consultant a report which he can go through with the respondent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b94a&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Not even the representative for the test thinks that knowledge of psychology is important! Personality consultants have no education in test methodology and no knowledge of personality theory. They just feed in numbers to a computer and have no idea what the results mean or what their scientific value is. It is very possible that Erikson believes that the test has scientific grounds and, given his lack of education, it is very likely that he has no idea what it actually says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f8ad&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;To try to find out more, in September 2017, we went to one of Erikson’s sold out lectures at the Rival theatre in Stockholm. The presentation was, for anyone with a basic education in psychology, embarrassing. He started by placing Freud and Jung as the grounders of modern psychology, a distinction that even a someone who has studied a four-week course in the area will know is incorrect. The subject has developed greatly since the time of Freud, Jung and comic book author, Marston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9c7a&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Both in that lecture, and later in radio interviews, Erikson attempts to explain that behaviour and personality are different. He claims that “personality lies a lot deeper”. This presentation appears to invoke the Gremlin we met earlier, who controls who we are. Considering that Erikson has no education at all in the behavioural sciences, this is a very understandable mistake. But it contradicts the very logic of modern psychology, which defines personality as repeatable behaviour. Gremlins have no scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f861&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;fy gl&quot;&gt;Did Erikson deliberately overstate his qualifications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9f2a&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;When faced with challenges to his work, Erikson claims that we are attempting to make out that his readers are idiots. Nothing could be further from the truth, we believe that the books have been falsely marketed, that readers have been misled to believe that Erikson does has a scientific background and that his books are based on research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;505c&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Despite a lack of any qualification, Erikson describes himself as a behavioural scientist. Before the publication of one of the first articles, in Swedish magazine Filter, questioning the validity of the &lt;em class=&quot;gk&quot;&gt;Surrounded by idiots&lt;/em&gt; book, Erikson e-mailed me (we both shared the same international agent, so we had met briefly once before) and asked whether, given my own profession as a psychologist and my position as a board member of the Swedish Skeptics Society, I would support his claim that he was a ‘behavioural scientist’. I declined to offer such support, despite the fact that from a legal point of view in Sweden, it is possible to call yourself a ‘behavioural scientist’ without any formal qualifications. He has just as much right as my poodle to call himself a behavioural scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d475&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, Erikson did tell Filter that I had had supported his right to use the title, a falsehood that was very easily revealed by the Filter journalist who phoned me up to double check the claim. On his homepage Erikson claimed that “in an interview with Filter I referred to a psychologist who supported my claim [to be a behavioural scientist]”. This is simply untrue. In the question of his qualifications, as with the reasoning within his books, Erikson appears to fool himself in to believing that he is in the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fc43&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Overstated qualifications aside, the question remains as why so many people bought the book, even as suspicions were raised about its validity. Part of the explanation can lie in genuine psychological phenomena. For example, the popularity of the book could be the result of the “snowball” effect where people talking about the book increased interest and others bought it because others were talking about it. Another is the “sunk cost” effect, whereby people who have bought the book, spent time reading it and maybe telling their friends about it, don’t want to lose face by admitting that they got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9058&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Then comes the question of where responsibility lies. The first version of the book was published by Hoi publishing, who help authors to self-publish. But as sales grew, it was Forum, part of Sweden’s biggest media concern Bonnier, who won the auction to buy the book and publish it for a wider audience. While Hoi may be forgiven for not checking the factual basis for a book, that a large publisher like Forum could publish without factchecking or assessing the authors background is difficult to fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;26eb&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;The same questions can be raised of TV4, SVT and Aftonbladet who used Erikson in his role as a behavioural expert. In the case of Aftonbladet, they asked Erikson to write a column even after the magazineFilter called in to question his expertise. When we at VoF named Erikson’s “Fraudster of the year” it received some attention in the national press, but was ignored by Aftonbladet. Up to that point, we can only imagine that each media outlet saw that others, including Bonnier, had accepted the book’s validity and assumed that it was scientifically sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d955&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Our society builds on trust. We assume that people who write books understand the area they are writing about. We trust respectable book publishers. We assume newspapers editors check facts and sources. We believe in public service television and radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8412&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;It is here we confront the biggest problem of all. In the age when anyone can publish their views online, the very institutions which we are meant to trust — -publishers, broadcasters and newspaper editors — -have to fight harder than ever to maintain their own trustworthiness. If they lose that trust then the very existence of democracy and the open society is at risk. For all of us: blue, red, yellow, lilac or green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0fd3&quot; class=&quot;fw fx ar bz fy b fz ga gb gc gd ge gf gg gh gi gj&quot;&gt;Since this article was published in spring 2019, Erikson’s book has been sold to over 35 countries. In Norway, it was last year’s all-round bestseller. Forbes had his book on a top-ten “must read” list. The estimated sales around the world is now 2.000.000 copies. And on amazon.com, his publisher is still presenting him as “behavioural scientist”.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Autocomplete as an Interface (2015)</title>
<link>https://www.benkuhn.net/autocomplete</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.benkuhn.net/autocomplete</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Many computer systems offer &lt;em&gt;autocomplete&lt;/em&gt;: the ability to guess what you’re about to type based on the first few letters you’ve typed. For instance, if you open up IPython and create a string variable, you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;syntax-highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
In [7]: s = 'foo'

In [8]: s.s&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;
s.split       s.splitlines  s.startswith  s.strip       s.swapcase
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m used to thinking of autocomplete as a convenience tool that saves you a few keystrokes, but it’s much more than that. Good autocompletion has become a driving factor in which tools I choose. If I were writing a sophisticated user interface today—say, a programming language or a complex application—autocompletion is one of the primary constraints I would design it around. It’s that important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tons of folks (including me) swear by zsh as a huge improvement over bash. But most of us barely use the actual features that are exclusive to zsh (RPROMPT? advanced globbing? “improved array handling”?) Instead, for most people the killer feature of zsh is that &lt;em&gt;it doesn’t re-output the prompt when you autocomplete&lt;/em&gt;. Compare…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zsh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;syntax-highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 test % cd fo&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;
foo1/  foo2/  foo3/  fop/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;syntax-highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
test$ cd fo&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;
foo1/ foo2/ foo3/ fop/
test$ cd fo
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In zsh, the cursor stays on the first line, whereas in bash, the cursor moves to the third line. (bash also requires you to hit twice—the first time you press it, you get a bell sound but no completions. Gee, thanks, bash!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one extra line is the single biggest reason why bash users leave. Because it means that bash barfs out a different set of completions every time you tab (twice):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;syntax-highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
test$ cd fo&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;
foo1/  foo11/ foo12/ foo13/ foo2/  foo3/  fop/
test$ cd foo&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;
foo1/  foo11/ foo12/ foo13/ foo2/  foo3/
test$ cd foo1&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;
foo1/  foo11/ foo12/ foo13/
test$ cd foo1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your directories start having more than 10 files in them, you’ll end up with an unreadable mess in your terminal history. Zsh, by contrast, will delete your previous completion lists when it makes a new one, avoiding the mess entirely. It’s a dramatically more pleasant experience when you autocomplete shell commands a hundred times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can point to exactly one tool that has approximately doubled my programming speed, and that’s the IPython notebook (as an alternative to coding into a file and running it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this is because I can immediately see the results of my computations. But a larger part is because IPython autocompletion is hands-down the best way of learning about Python.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:much&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I want to manipulate a string in Python. I could open up a new tab, google “Python string api”, remember whether I need Python 2 or Python 3, scroll through their &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html&quot;&gt;badly organized page on strings&lt;/a&gt;, realize that the first Python 3 result for “python string api” &lt;em&gt;doesn’t actually describe the methods on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, search “python string methods” instead, realize I wanted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html&quot;&gt;“built-in types”&lt;/a&gt; docs, scroll wildly through their &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html&quot;&gt;long, spaced-out list of methods&lt;/a&gt; until I found one I wanted, context-switch back to my code, and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I swear I wasn’t trying to pick a particularly convoluted example and this is &lt;em&gt;actually what happened&lt;/em&gt; when I looked for the string documentation while I was making this post)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I could take my string object that already exists in my notebook, type &lt;code&gt;s.&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and see whether any useful-looking methods appeared. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just with strings, which have relatively well-written documentation. Good luck navigating something less well-supported like &lt;a href=&quot;http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/&quot;&gt;PyQT&lt;/a&gt; with the written documentation! I hope you enjoy constantly translating from C++ to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note, this is a big advantage of the Python-style &lt;code&gt;foo.bar()&lt;/code&gt; instead of Julia-style &lt;code&gt;bar(foo)&lt;/code&gt; for method calls. In Python you can type &lt;code&gt;foo.&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and get a list of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; methods. I’m not sure an equivalent operation exists in Julia, and it would be tough to design one that’s as easy to use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my waking hours in a state of mild annoyance at Xcode. But it’s a great case study of autocompletion enabling fundamental interaction shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective-C really &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; autocomplete in a way that many languages don’t, because in Objective-C all arguments are keyword arguments. (Mostly.) Your method calls will look something like&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:actual&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;syntax-highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;NSLayoutConstraint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;constraintsWithVisualFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;views&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewDict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’ve left it to hang off the side of the page for effect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the method names can get pretty heinous. I’m glad that somebody else is invoking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;syntax-highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;MTLBlitCommandEncoder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;copyFromTexture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;sourceSlice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;sourceLevel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;sourceOrigin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;sourceSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;toBuffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;destinationOffset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;destinationBytesPerRow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;destinationBytesPerImage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so I don’t have to.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:longest&quot;/&gt; The API writers could certainly use a lesson in concision. And the fact that Apple’s methods were designed for autocomplete means that the language is practically unusable in environments without it, which in practice means substantial lock-in to Apple’s proprietary dev tools since no one else invests as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another few hands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;11.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitting is a complex operation that needs to go really fast! If you want to blit something quickly you actually do need an eight-parameter method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we don’t usually need named parameters is that (a) there’s usually an obvious convention for the order that the parameters go in, so the programmer can guess the order; (b) if you mess up the order, the type system will usually catch your mistake. If you have eight integer parameters, both of these break down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even for methods with fewer arguments, transposing the order of two non-keyword arguments of is one of the easiest bugs to make and the hardest to catch in code review. I’ve worked at multiple companies where a bad enough bug could theoretically wipe out millions of dollars before anyone noticed. Keyword args are &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:and&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This style means that method names are largely self-documenting. Fewer documentation lookups means fewer context switches, which means faster programming. It also means that it’s easier to tell if a method is the one you want &lt;em&gt;from inside the autocomplete window&lt;/em&gt; instead of searching for it in the documentation, which reduces context-switching even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to shorten names “to save typing” is one of the great scourges of interface design, because you end up switching between e.g. &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; depending on how much they want to save space. Good autocomplete means you can implement an obvious rule: just don’t do that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruthie often tells me that “keystrokes are cheap.” But Objective-C shows that this isn’t quite true, at least in big enough aggregate. Saving one or two keystrokes isn’t usually worth the trouble, but Xcode can save programmers tens of keystrokes per method call. By the tens or hundreds, keystroke costs do add up—both in terms of time spent typing, and of chance to make a typo that costs further time to correct and recompile. Removing that kind of cost is a big enough deal that it’s transformed how Objective-C interfaces are designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I discovered keyboard shortcuts, I used to spend a ton of time looking for things in menus. That’s why one of my favorite features in OS X is the search bar in the Help menu. In newer versions of OS X, &lt;code&gt;⌘-⇧-/&lt;/code&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;code&gt;⌘-?&lt;/code&gt;) opens up the Help menu and plops your cursor in a search bar that can search through every menu item in the application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;351&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/bknet/autocomplete/help-shot.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason I ever browse menus anymore is out of habit. (And because the search isn’t quite as great as it could be—it can still be more efficient to use menus if you know exactly where your target is.) &lt;code&gt;⌘-&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for Spotlight serves a similar function for apps, files, and other miscellaneous computer objects, and it’s replaced my need for the dock,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmail’s contact autocompletion means you barely even need to remember what your contact’s name is, let alone their email. Google search autocompletion means you don’t even need to know what you’re looking for—type in some vaguely relevant words and Google will guess what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course Emacs autocompletion deserves a special mention, especially as augmented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm&quot;&gt;helm&lt;/a&gt;. I have 90 files open in emacs right now and I can find any particular one in five keystrokes. Imagine having 90 tabs open in Chrome—you could never find anything! With Emacs I don’t even need a tab bar because it’s so simple to autocomplete the buffer I need. In fact, I’ve set it up not to distinguish between files on disk and files that are already open—when I ask emacs “switch to this buffer” I’m really asking it “open this file (or show the buffer if it’s already open).” And it’s still fast and seamless.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:more&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why is auto-completion so great?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the keyboard is a much higher-bandwidth interface than pointing and clicking. If you type 60 words per minute you’re typing 4 characters per second, for 24 bits of entropy per second. To match that precision with a mouse would require you to be able to identify and navigate to any thumbnail-sized part of your screen in a third of a second.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:calc&quot;/&gt; Maybe barely doable if you’re very dextrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with most keyboard-based interfaces is that, even if the input is high-bandwidth, the output isn’t. For instance, my text editor appears on a screen with 3.5 million pixels (100 megabits of entropy if we’re being generous), but it’s barely using any of that to display novel information—every time I press a key, I can predict almost exactly what my file will look like afterwards. I’m giving the computer a lot of information, but I’m not getting very much back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s why the high-bandwidth visual interface is important: The common thread in between the autocompletion in zsh, IPython, Xcode and OS X help is that it &lt;em&gt;makes it easy to find hidden things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As computers get more complex, the number of objects they have to deal with—files, functions, menu items, or anything else—explodes. The easiest way to tame the complexity is to hide these objects away until you, the user, call them out by name. But the computer is dumb, so you have to get the name &lt;em&gt;exactly right&lt;/em&gt;. You have to pick exactly the right menu sequence, or type out the method signature precisely, without any feedback process—it’s like shooting a bullseye in the dark. Autocomplete turns on the lights.&lt;/p&gt;
