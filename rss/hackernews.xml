<title>Who’s behind the “reopen” domain surge?</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/whos-behind-the-reopen-domain-surge/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/whos-behind-the-reopen-domain-surge/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks have seen a large number of new domain registrations beginning with the word “reopen” and ending with U.S. city or state names. The largest number of them were created just hours after &lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt; sent a series of all-caps tweets urging citizens to “liberate” themselves from new gun control measures and state leaders who’ve enacted strict social distancing restrictions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s a closer look at who and what appear to be behind these domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_51326&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-51326&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/liberate.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;594&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A series of inciteful tweets sent by President Trump on April 17, the same day dozens of state-themed “reopen” domains were registered — mostly by conservative groups and gun rights advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity began this research after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/g3niq3/i_simply_cannot_believe_that_people_are/fnstpyl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a fascinating Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend on several “reopen” sites that seemed to be engaged in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;astroturfing&lt;/a&gt;, which involves masking the sponsors of a message or organization to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reddit discussion focused on a handful of new domains — including &lt;strong&gt;reopenmn.com&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;reopenpa.com&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;reopenva.com&lt;/strong&gt; — that appeared to be tied to various gun rights groups in those states. Their registrations have roughly coincided with contemporaneous demonstrations in Minnesota, California and Tennessee where people showed up to protest quarantine restrictions over the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_51330&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-51330&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/reopen-ca.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A “reopen California” protest over the weekend in Huntington Beach, Calif. Image: Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspecting that these were but a subset of a larger corpus of similar domains registered for every state in the union, KrebsOnSecurity ran a domain search report at &lt;strong&gt;DomainTools&lt;/strong&gt; [an advertiser on this site], &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.domaintools.com/research/domain-search&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;requesting&lt;/a&gt; any and all domains registered in the past month that begin with “reopen” and end in “.com.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lookup returned approximately 150 domains; in addition to those named after the individual 50 states, some of the domains refer to large American cities or counties, and others to more general concepts, such as “&lt;strong&gt;reopeningchurch.com&lt;/strong&gt;” or “&lt;strong&gt;reopenamericanbusiness.com&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the domains are still dormant, leading to parked pages and registration records obscured behind privacy protection services. But a review of other details about these domains suggests a majority of them are tied to various gun rights groups, state Republican Party organizations, and conservative think tanks, religious and advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, reopenmn.com forwards to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minnesotagunrights.org/about-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;minnesotagunrights.org&lt;/a&gt;, but the site’s WHOIS registration records (obscured since the Reddit thread went viral) point to an individual living in Florida. That same Florida resident registered &lt;strong&gt;reopenpa.com&lt;/strong&gt;, a site that forwards to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://action.pennsylvaniafirearmsassociation.org/action/end-wolfs-shutdown/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pennsylvania Firearms Association&lt;/a&gt;, and urges the state’s residents to contact their governor about easing the COVID-19 restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reopenpa.com is tied to a Facebook page called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/525702768306093&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to organize an “Operation Gridlock” protest at noon today in Pennsylvania among its 68,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Minnesota and Pennsylvania gun advocacy sites include the same Google Analytics tracker in their source code: &lt;strong&gt;UA-60996284&lt;/strong&gt;. A cursory Internet search on that code shows it also is present on &lt;strong&gt;reopentexasnow.com&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;reopenwi.com &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;reopeniowa.com&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the same code shows up on a number of other anti-gun control sites registered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.midwestfreedomenterprises.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Dorr Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, real-life brothers who have created nonprofits (in name only) across dozens of states that are so extreme in their stance they make the National Rifle Association look like a liberal group by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cleveland.com/open/2019/08/how-one-ohio-gun-rights-group-aims-to-upend-the-public-debate-by-scaring-republicans.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;This 2019 article at cleveland.com&lt;/a&gt; quotes several 2nd Amendment advocates saying the Dorr brothers simply seek “to stir the pot and make as much animosity as they can, and then raise money off that animosity.” The site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dorrbrotherscams.com/p/how-dorr-brothers-work.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;dorrbrotherscams.com&lt;/a&gt; also is instructive here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of other sites — such as &lt;strong&gt;reopennc.com&lt;/strong&gt; — seem to exist merely to sell t-shirts, decals and yard signs with such slogans as “Know Your Rights,” “Live Free or Die,” and “Facts not Fear.” WHOIS records show the same Florida resident who registered this North Carolina site also registered one for New York — &lt;strong&gt;reopenny.com&lt;/strong&gt; — just a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_51328&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-51328&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/reopennc-sales.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;593&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Merchandise available from reopennc.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the concept reopen domains — including &lt;strong&gt;reopenoureconomy.com&lt;/strong&gt; (registered Apr. 15) and &lt;strong&gt;reopensociety.com&lt;/strong&gt; (Apr. 16) — trace back to &lt;strong&gt;FreedomWorks&lt;/strong&gt;, a conservative group that the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/57f673f31fb343042e3806b9806e8f7d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; has been holding weekly virtual town halls with members of Congress, “igniting an activist base of thousands of supporters across the nation to back up the effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reopenoc.com&lt;/strong&gt; — which advocates for lifting social restrictions in Orange County, Calif. — links to &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.facebook.com/groups/234070164617125?view=permalink&amp;amp;id=234861651204643&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a Facebook page for Orange County Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, and has been chronicling the street protests there. The messaging on &lt;strong&gt;Reopensc.com&lt;/strong&gt; — urging visitors to digitally sign a reopen petition to the state governor — is identical to the message on the Facebook page of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/66933899691&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Horry County, SC Conservative Republicans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reopenmississippi.com&lt;/strong&gt; was registered on April 16 to &lt;strong&gt;In Pursuit of LLC&lt;/strong&gt;, an Arlington, Va.-based conservative group with a number of former employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/trump-town/organizations/in-pursuit-of-llc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;who currently work at the White House or in cabinet agencies&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/12/07/charles-koch-launches-marketing-firm-major-overhaul-political-empire/95109784/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2016 story from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says In Pursuit Of LLC is a for-profit communications agency launched by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Koch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;billionaire industrialist Charles Koch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span id=&quot;more-51320&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the reopen sites that have redacted names and other information about their registrants nevertheless hold other clues, mainly based on &lt;em&gt;precisely when&lt;/em&gt; they were registered. Each domain registration record includes a date and timestamp down to the second that the domain was registered. By grouping the timestamps for domains that have obfuscated registration details and comparing them to domains that do include ownership data, we can infer more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, more than 50 reopen domains were registered within an hour of each other on April 17 — between 3:25 p.m. ET and 4:43 ET. Most of these lack registration details, but a handful of them did (until the Reddit post went viral) include the registrant name &lt;strong&gt;Michael Murphy&lt;/strong&gt;, the same name tied to the aforementioned Minnesota and Pennsylvania gun rights domains (reopenmn.com and reopenpa.com) that were registered within seconds of each other on April 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_51337&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;lightbox&quot; href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-17.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-51337&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A large number of “reopen” domains were registered within the same one-hour period on April 17, and tie back to the same name used in the various reopen domains connected to gun rights groups. A link to the spreadsheet where this screen shot is drawn from is included below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google spreadsheet documenting much of the domain information sourced in this story is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HQnx-RvMM7BrpX1ysgjqzu8XkaDeu0w4gJgTtzB3dfk/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one responded to the email addresses and phone numbers tied to Mr. Murphy, who may or may not have been involved in this domain registration scheme. Those contact details suggest he runs a store in Florida that makes art out of reclaimed or discarded items, and that he operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nassauwebdesign.com/about-us.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a Web site design company&lt;/a&gt; in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, various social media profiles tied to Mr. Murphy’s contact details suggest this persona may not present a complete picture. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lowerpigpen/with_replies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; tied to Murphy’s email address promoted nothing but spammy paid surveys for years. And a Skype lookup on his phone number curiously returns a Russian profile under the name валентина сынах (translated as “Valentine Sons”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-51325&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/valentinasons.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;472&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as President Trump likes to refer to stories critical of him and his administration as “fake news,” this type of astroturfing is not only dangerous to public health, but it’s reminiscent of the playbook used by Russia to sow discord, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/policy/technology/358025-thousands-attended-protest-organized-by-russians-on-facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;create phony protest events&lt;/a&gt;, and spread disinformation across America in the lead-up to the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire astroturfing campaign also brings to mind a “local news” network called &lt;a href=&quot;https://lgis.co/contact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Local Government Information Services&lt;/a&gt; (LGIS), an organization founded in 2018 which operates &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k-GgWMNhg1se5302MCBhHxmBJnEhvlc9OL_ONDfEsas/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a huge network of hundreds of sites&lt;/a&gt; that purport to be local news sites in various states. However, most of the content is generated by automated computer algorithms that consume data from reports released by U.S. executive branch federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relatively scarce actual bylined content on these LGIS sites is authored by freelancers who are in most cases nowhere near the localities they cover. Other content not drawn from government reports often repurpose press releases from conservative Web sites, including gunrightswatch.com, taxfoundation.org, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>In Pursuit of PPE</title>
<link>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2010025?mc_cid=4f9434619c&amp;mc_eid=01d3ed8b19</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2010025?mc_cid=4f9434619c&amp;mc_eid=01d3ed8b19</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;f-body&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;To rapidly communicate short reports of innovative responses to Covid-19 around the world, along with a range of current thinking on policy and strategy relevant to the pandemic, the Journal has initiated the Covid-19 Notes series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;f-body&quot;&gt;As a chief physician executive, I rarely get involved in my health system’s supply-chain activities. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed that. Protecting our caregivers is essential so that these talented professionals can safely provide compassionate care to our patients. Yet we continue to be stymied by a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the cavalry does not appear to be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f-body&quot;&gt;Our supply-chain group has worked around the clock to secure gowns, gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators. These employees have adapted to a new normal, exploring every lead, no matter how unusual. Deals, some bizarre and convoluted, and many involving large sums of money, have dissolved at the last minute when we were outbid or outmuscled, sometimes by the federal government. Then we got lucky, but getting the supplies was not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f-body&quot;&gt;A lead came from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member. After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker’s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds — more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers — we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f-body&quot;&gt;Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system’s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE. Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;f-body&quot;&gt;This experience might have made for an entertaining tale at a cocktail party, had the success of our mission not been so critical. Did I foresee, as a health-system leader working in a rich, highly developed country with state-of-the-art science and technology and incredible talent, that my organization would ever be faced with such a set of circumstances? Of course not. Yet when encountering the severe constraints that attend this pandemic, we must leave no stone unturned to give our health care teams and our patients a fighting chance. This is the unfortunate reality we face in the time of Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Python 2.7.18, the last release of Python 2</title>
<link>https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2020/04/python-2718-last-release-of-python-2.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pythoninsider.blogspot.com/2020/04/python-2718-last-release-of-python-2.html</guid>
<description>The CPython core developers are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Python 2.7.18.&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7&lt;br/&gt;release and therefore the last Python 2 release. It's time for the CPython&lt;br/&gt;community to say a fond but firm farewell to Python 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download this unique, commemorative Python release on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/&quot;&gt;python.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7 has been under active development since the release of Python 2.6,&lt;br/&gt;more than 11 years ago. Over all those years, CPython's core developers and&lt;br/&gt;contributors sedulously applied bug fixes to the 2.7 branch, no small task as&lt;br/&gt;the Python 2 and 3 branches diverged. There were large changes midway through&lt;br/&gt;Python 2.7's life such as PEP 466's feature backports to the ssl module and&lt;br/&gt;hash randomization. Traditionally, these features would never have been added&lt;br/&gt;to a branch in maintenance mode, but exceptions were made to keep Python 2 users&lt;br/&gt;secure. Thank you to CPython's community for such dedication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7 was lucky to have the services of two generations of binary builders&lt;br/&gt;and operating system experts, Martin von Löwis and Steve Dower for Windows, and&lt;br/&gt;Ronald Oussoren and Ned Deily for macOS. The reason we provided binary Python&lt;br/&gt;2.7 releases for macOS 10.9, an operating system obsoleted by Apple 4 years ago,&lt;br/&gt;or why the &quot;Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7&quot; exists is the&lt;br/&gt;dedication of these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3 would be nowhere without the dedication of the wider community. Library&lt;br/&gt;maintainers followed CPython by maintaining Python 2 support for many years but&lt;br/&gt;also threw their weight behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://python3statement.org&quot;&gt;Python 3 statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Linux distributors chased Python 2 out of their&lt;br/&gt;archives. Users migrated hundreds of millions of lines of code, developed&lt;br/&gt;porting guides, and kept Python 2 in their brain while Python 3 gained 10 years&lt;br/&gt;of improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, thank you to GvR for creating Python 0.9, 1, 2, and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long live Python 3+!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Whole Foods is tracking and scoring stores it deems at risk of unionizing</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-foods-tracks-unionization-risk-with-heat-map-2020-1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-foods-tracks-unionization-risk-with-heat-map-2020-1</guid>
<description>&lt;ul class=&quot;summary-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Amazon-owned Whole Foods is tracking and scoring stores it deems at risk of unionizing, according to five people with knowledge of the effort and &lt;strong&gt;internal documents viewed by Business Insider.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scores are based on more than two dozen metrics, including racial diversity, employee loyalty, &quot;tipline&quot; calls, and violations recorded by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In response to this story, Whole Foods said: &quot;Whole Foods Market recognizes the rights of our Team Members to decide whether union representation is right for them. We agree with the overwhelming majority of our Team Members that a direct relationship with Whole Foods Market and its leadership, where Team Members have open lines of communication and every individual is empowered to share feedback directly with their team leaders, is best.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking active or potential unionization is a common practice among large companies, according to labor experts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;summary_bullets&quot;&gt;Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole Foods is keeping an eye on stores at risk of unionizing through an interactive heat map, according to five people with knowledge of the matter and internal documents viewed by Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat map is powered by an elaborate scoring system, which assigns a rating to each of Whole Foods' 510 stores based on the likelihood that their employees might form or join a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stores' individual risk scores are calculated from more than two dozen metrics, including employee &quot;loyalty,&quot; turnover, and racial diversity; &quot;tipline&quot; calls to human resources; proximity to a union office; and violations recorded by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map also tracks local economic and demographic factors such as the unemployment rate in a store's location and the percentage of families in the area living below the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stores' scores on each metric are fed into the heat map, which is a geographic illustration of the United States peppered with red spots to indicate high-risk Whole Foods stores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The heat map reveals how Whole Foods is using technology and data to help manage its vast workforce of more than 95,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also provides a rare look into corporate labor-tracking activities, a common practice among large companies but one rarely discussed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement on the map describes its purpose as specific to monitoring unionization among its employees, which the company calls team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The [Team Member] Relations Heatmap is designed to identify stores at risk of unionization,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;This early identification enables resources to be funneled to the highest need locations, with the goal of mitigating risk by addressing challenges early before they become problematic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole Foods did not respond to questions about what sort of resources are funneled to the &quot;highest need&quot; stores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In a statement provided to Business Insider, the company said an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of its employees prefer a &quot;direct relationship&quot; with the company over union representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whole Foods Market recognizes the rights of our Team Members to decide whether union representation is right for them,&quot; the company said. &quot;We agree with the overwhelming majority of our Team Members that a direct relationship with Whole Foods Market and its leadership, where Team Members have open lines of communication and every individual is empowered to share feedback directly with their team leaders, is best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our open-door communication policy allows us to understand and quickly respond to the needs of our workforce, while recognizing, rewarding, and supporting the goals of every member of our team,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;At Whole Foods Market, we're committed to treating all of our Team Members fairly, creating a safe, inclusive, and empowering working environment, and providing our Team Members with career advancement opportunities, great benefits, and competitive compensation, including an industry-leading starting minimum wage of $15/hour.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Whole Foods calculates a store's risk of unionizing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lazy-holder lazy-holder&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot; data-content-type=&quot;image/jpeg&quot; data-srcs=&quot;{&amp;quot;https://i.insider.com/5e3dbc1b0ce3d1284b16f7f9&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;contentType&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;image/jpeg&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;aspectRatioW&amp;quot;:4,&amp;quot;aspectRatioH&amp;quot;:3}}&quot; alt=&quot;WholeFoods23&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.insider.com/5e3dbc1b0ce3d1284b16f7f9?width=600&amp;amp;format=jpeg&amp;amp;auto=webp&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Business Insider/Hayley Peterson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole Foods uses the heat map and related scores to determine where stores must take action to address risks, according to the documents and people familiar with the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, higher scores indicate lower risks of unionization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The map monitors three main areas: &quot;external risks,&quot; &quot;store risks,&quot; and &quot;team member sentiment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the factors that contribute to external risk scores include local union membership size; distance in miles between the store and the closest union; number of charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board alleging labor-law violations; and a &quot;labor incident tracker,&quot; which logs incidents related to organizing and union activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other external factors include the percentage of families within the store's zip code that fall below the poverty line and the local unemployment rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whole Foods' heat map says lower rates of racial diversity increase unionization risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group of metrics in the scoring system, called store risks, aren't a direct cause of risk &quot;but can predispose a store to risk,&quot; according to documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Store-risk metrics include average store compensation, average total store sales, and a &quot;diversity index&quot; that represents the racial and ethnic diversity of every store. Stores at higher risk of unionizing have lower diversity and lower employee compensation, as well as higher total store sales and higher rates of workers' compensation claims, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third area of metrics is &quot;team member sentiment.&quot; These metrics, which include items like employee loyalty and engagement, are &quot;designed to be the most actionable,&quot; the documents show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;sentiment&quot; data is pulled from internal employee surveys and &quot;is likely to be the first score to improve based on your efforts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures assess employees' feedback on the quality and safety of their work environment and whether they feel supported and respected, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tracking potential unionization is common among large companies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the heat map, Whole Foods appears to be trying to identify and address circumstances ripe for employee unrest that could lead to attempts to form a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of workforce analysis is something large companies have done for decades, albeit without some of the technology available today that can automate parts of that process, according to labor experts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Walmart, for example, hired an intelligence-gathering service from Lockheed Martin and ranked stores by labor activity when it faced protests eight years ago organized by the union-backed activist group OUR Walmart, according to a 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-walmart-union-surveillance/&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;body_link&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/a&gt; story citing thousands of court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Employers spend millions of dollars a year to hire union avoidance advisers to see how susceptible they are to their workers organizing,&quot; Celine McNicholas, the director of government affairs and labor counsel for the Economic Policy Institute, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why some companies closely track union activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A preponderance of the business community [has] a total allergy to unionization,&quot; Wilma Liebman, who served on the National Labor Relations Board under Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unions give employees more bargaining power over things such as wages and health benefits, she said. They could also increase the chances of employee strikes, which can disrupt business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies &quot;don't want anything that's going to interfere with their autonomy and their ability to act unilaterally&quot; and &quot;sometimes they're convinced [unions] are going to cost them more than they can afford,&quot; Liebman said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Research shows unionized workers tend to earn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;body_link&quot;&gt;higher wages&lt;/a&gt; and are more likely to have access to certain benefits like employer-sponsored &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/union-workers-more-likely-than-nonunion-workers-to-have-healthcare-benefits-in-2019.htm?view_full&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;body_link&quot;&gt;healthcare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of unions argue, however, that the organizations can harm companies economically, forcing layoffs or job outsourcing, and that they don't have workers' best interests in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why some companies monitor their workers to try to address any signs that employees might organize head-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US labor law protects employees' right to unionize. It's legal, however, for a company to monitor and address labor organizing as long as it doesn't threaten, coerce, restrain, or interfere with efforts to unionize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, US companies spent at least $100 million on consulting services for anti-union campaigns between 2014 and 2017, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute based on disclosure forms filed with the US Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;McNicholas said using a data-powered heat map to monitor for unionization risks &quot;is just the next frontier of employer opposition to unions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Valve&amp;#039;s Proton Has Brought 6000 Windows Games to Linux So Far</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apart from the new games that Proton brings us on a regular basis, it’s also important to look as a whole how Proton has changed the landscape over time. While the numbers are always pretty much available on the front page of ProtonDB, I take a slightly different look at it to build a graph of “Platinum” games (i.e. working out of the box without any tricks) to Linux using Proton. And you get this: (click to enlarge)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://boilingsteam.com/wp-content/uploads/Platinum-over-time-2020-04-01.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://boilingsteam.com/wp-content/uploads/Platinum-over-time-2020-04-01-1024x594.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4892&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;446&quot; srcset=&quot;https://boilingsteam.com/wp-content/uploads/Platinum-over-time-2020-04-01-1024x594.png 1024w, https://boilingsteam.com/wp-content/uploads/Platinum-over-time-2020-04-01-300x174.png 300w, https://boilingsteam.com/wp-content/uploads/Platinum-over-time-2020-04-01-768x446.png 768w, https://boilingsteam.com/wp-content/uploads/Platinum-over-time-2020-04-01.png 1378w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few take-aways from this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proton has done far more for Linux gaming than any porting company out there, by bringing about 6000 games to us in less than 2 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s about 100 games every month that get a Platinum rating according to ProtonDB. (because of the recent changes on ProtonDB rating, this is now more accurate than it was before).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proton has become better over time: the percentage of games getting a Platinum rating is steadily increasing over time as well – it used to be about 40% of all unique games reported, and now we are closer to 50%. This is cumulative, so the range will vary month by month but the trend is very clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not even take in account games that are playable with minor modifications (adding a launcher flag, changing the name of an .exe in a directory, etc…) so the real number of games you can actually enjoy with Proton is way higher than that. But “Platinum” sets the bar high and we ought to judge Proton on its promise: making Windows games work on Linux with just one click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, it’s been an overwhelming success.&lt;/p&gt;
