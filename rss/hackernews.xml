<title>Bill and Melinda Gates Are Paying Off Nigeria&amp;#039;s $76M Debt to Japan</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;desc&quot;&gt;Philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, is pictured in Paris.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Kamil Zihnioglu/AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;74.480487804878&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As some leaders are increasing their focus on issues solely within their own borders, Bill and Melinda Gates continue to show the importance of looking outward — and they’ve demonstrated this yet again by announcing they will settle Nigeria’s $76 million debt to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nigeria’s debt to Japan is the result of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) provided by the Japanese government in 2014 for increased polio eradication efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The country has made great strides in its efforts to eliminate the disease thanks to this funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nigeria did not record a wild case of polio from July 2014 to August 2016, when two cases were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/polio-eradication-faces-setback-as-nigeria-records-first-cases-in-two-years-1.20416&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;No new cases of the wild poliovirus were reported in 2017 and there were only four cases reported in 2016, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/&quot;&gt;Global Polio Eradication Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.2535211267606&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In 1988, there were 350,000 new polio cases. Last year, there were just 21. Here’s what made this progress possible: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wpTTpyg0VF&quot;&gt;https://t.co/wpTTpyg0VF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qW5chL09rl&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qW5chL09rl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;All of this means that Nigeria is very close to eradicating polio, which would leave just two countries in the world where the disease is still endemic, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Global Citizen campaigns to eradicate polio and ensure all individuals have access to good healthcare. You can take action &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/take-action/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As the largest private philanthropic organization in the world, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation spends just over $3 billion a year on development assistance, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/13/bill-gates-foundation-dont-expect-pick-up-the-bill-for-sweeping-aid-cuts-trump&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Eradicating polio is one of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio&quot;&gt;top priorities&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, at the last &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2017/06/12/gates-foundation-and-rotary-pledge-additional-450-million-to-end-polio/#505385265ec1&quot;&gt;annual Rotary International Convention in Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, the Gates Foundation announced it would match two-to-one Rotary's commitment to raise $50 million a year over the next three years, which would result in $450 million towards polio eradication efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Some people, especially these days, think the world is getting worse,” Gates said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2017/06/12/gates-foundation-and-rotary-pledge-additional-450-million-to-end-polio/#505385265ec1&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;at the convention&lt;/a&gt;  last June. “The progress on polio is a reminder of what people can accomplish when they are bold, determined, and willing to work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;While the Gates family is notoriously generous and forward-thinking when it comes to supporting the accomplishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/sep/13/bill-gates-foundation-dont-expect-pick-up-the-bill-for-sweeping-aid-cuts-trump&quot;&gt;Bill Gates has said&lt;/a&gt; that organizations like his foundation are not prepared to fill the gaps that could result from foreign aid cuts like those proposed by US President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Helping other countries fight poverty and disease makes the world more stable, and it makes Americans and people everywhere safer. Foreign aid delivers a fantastic return on investment,” Gates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/16-Million-Reasons-To-Be-Optimistic-About-Polio&quot;&gt;said at the convention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Polio eradication efforts have not only helped eliminate the disease in most countries, but they have led to better health systems and improved responses to other global health crises like ebola and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nigeria’s Minister of Finance Kemi Adeosun announced the debt repayment on Tuesday in Abuja when she met with Japanese House of Councillors Parliamentarians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The repayment was set to begin four years after Japan’s loan in 2014, which is what has now sparked the repayment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Memory Loss</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2018/01/15/Google-is-losing-its-memory</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;centercontent&quot; readability=&quot;90.535024611889&quot;&gt;
&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I think Google has stopped in­dex­ing the old­er parts of the We­b. I think I can prove it. Google’s com­pe­ti­tion is do­ing bet­ter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-1&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Ev­i­dence&lt;/span&gt; · This isn’t just a proof, it’s a rock-n-roll proof. Back in 2006, I pub­lished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/13/Rock-n-Roll-Animal&quot;&gt;a re­view&lt;/a&gt; of Lou Reed’s &lt;cite&gt;Rock n Roll An­i­mal&lt;/cite&gt; al­bum. Back in 2008, &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/&quot;&gt;Brent Sim­mons&lt;/a&gt; pub­lished &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2008/11/04/that_new_sound&quot;&gt;That New Sound&lt;/a&gt;, about The Clash’s &lt;cite&gt;Lon­don Calling&lt;/cite&gt;. Here’s a chal­lenge: Can you find ei­ther of these with Google? Even if you read them first and can care­ful­ly con­jure up exact-match strings, and then use the “site:” pre­fix? I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Up­date: Now you can, be­cause this piece went a lit­tle vi­ral. But you sure couldn’t ear­li­er in the day.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/span&gt; · Ob­vi­ous­ly, in­dex­ing the whole Web is crush­ing­ly ex­pen­sive, and get­ting more so ev­ery day. Things like 10+-year-old mu­sic re­views that are nev­er up­dat­ed, no longer ac­cept com­ments, are light­ly if at all linked-to out­side their own site, and rarely if ev­er visited… well, let’s face it, Google’s not go­ing to be sell­ing many ads next to search re­sults that turn them up. So from a busi­ness point of view, it’s hard to make a case for Google in­dex­ing ev­ery­thing, no mat­ter how old and how ob­scure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pain here is pure­ly per­son­al; I freely con­fess that I’d been us­ing Google’s glob­al in­fras­truc­ture as my own per­son­al search in­dex for my own per­son­al pub­li­ca­tion­s. But the pain is re­al; I fre­quent­ly mine my own his­to­ry to re-use, for ex­am­ple in con­struct­ing the cur­rent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Song%20of%20the%20Day/&quot;&gt;#SongOfTheDay&lt;/a&gt; se­ries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-4&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Com­pe­ti­tion&lt;/span&gt; · Bing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bing.com/search?q=tim+bray+rock+n+roll+animal&amp;amp;qs=n&amp;amp;form=QBLH&amp;amp;sp=-1&amp;amp;pq=tim+bray+rock+n+roll+animal&amp;amp;sc=1-11&amp;amp;sk=&amp;amp;cvid=503B1ECB9D0F4435B04866A1E59BE757&quot;&gt;can find it&lt;/a&gt;! Duck­Duck­Go &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tim+bray+rock+n+roll+animal&amp;amp;t=hf&amp;amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;can too&lt;/a&gt;! Both of them can find Brent’s &lt;cite&gt;Lon­don Calling&lt;/cite&gt; piece, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;What Google cares about&lt;/span&gt; · It cares about giv­ing you great an­swers to the ques­tions that mat­ter to you right now. And I find that if I type in a ques­tion, even some­thing com­pli­cat­ed and ob­scure, Google of­ten sur­pris­es me with a time­ly, ac­cu­rate an­swer. They’ve nev­er claimed to in­dex ev­ery word on ev­ery page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My men­tal mod­el of the Web is as a per­ma­nen­t, long-lived store of humanity’s in­tel­lec­tu­al her­itage. For this to be use­ful, it needs to be in­dexed, just like a li­brary. Google ap­par­ent­ly doesn’t share that view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-6&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;What I’m go­ing to do&lt;/span&gt; · When I have a ques­tion I want an­swered, I’ll prob­a­bly still go to Google. When I want to find a spe­cif­ic Web page and I think I know some of the words it con­tain­s, I won’t any more, I’ll pick Bing or Duck­Duck­Go.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Community-Owned Fiber Networks: Value Leaders in America</title>
<link>https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2018/01/communityfiber</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cyber.harvard.edu/publications/2018/01/communityfiber</guid>
<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;by David Talbot, Kira Hessekiel, and Danielle Kehl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By one recent estimate, about 9.2 percent of Americans, or almost 30 million people, lack access to wired home broadband service, which the FCC defines as an Internet access connection providing speeds of at least 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even where home broadband is available, high prices inhibit adoption; in one national survey, 33 percent of non-subscribers cited cost of service as the primary barrier. Municipally and other community-owned networks have been proposed as a driver of competition and resulting better service and prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We examined prices advertised by a subset of community-owned networks that use fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technology. In late 2015 and 2016 we collected advertised prices for residential data plans offered by 40 community-owned (typically municipally-owned) FTTH networks. We then identified the least-expensive service that meets the federal definition of broadband (regardless of the exact speeds provided) and compared advertised prices to those of private competitors in the same markets. We were able to make comparisons in 27 communities and found that in 23 cases, the community-owned FTTH providers’ pricing was lower when the service costs and fees were averaged over four years. (Using a three year-average changed this fraction to 22 out of 27.) In the other 13 communities, comparisons were not possible, either because the private providers’ website terms of service deterred or prohibited data collection or because no competitor offered service that qualified as broadband. We also found that almost all community-owned FTTH networks offered prices that were clear and unchanging, whereas private ISPs typically charged initial low promotional or “teaser” rates that later sharply rose, usually after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We made the incidental finding that Comcast advertised different prices and terms for the same service in different regions. We do not have enough information to draw conclusions about the impacts of these practices. In general, our ability to study broadband pricing was constrained by the lack of standardization in internet service offerings and a shortage of available data. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Researchers find that one person likely drove Bitcoin from $150 to $1,000</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/15/researchers-finds-that-one-person-likely-drove-bitcoin-from-150-to-1000/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/branding-bitcoin.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Researchers Neil Gandal, JT Hamrick, Tyler Moore, and Tali Oberman have written a fascinating paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/tag/Bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; price manipulation. Entitled “Price Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem” and appearing in the recent issue of the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393217301666&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Journal of Monetary Economics&lt;/a&gt; the paper describes to what degree the Bitcoin ecosystem is controlled by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To many it’s been obvious that the Bitcoin markets are, at the very least, being manipulated by one or two big players. “This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired,” the researchers wrote. “During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that many instances of price manipulation happened simply because the market was very thin for various cryptocurrencies including early Bitcoin. “Despite the huge increase in market capitalization, similar to the bitcoin market in 2013 (the period examined), markets for these other cryptocurrencies are very thin. The number of cryptocurrencies has increased from approximately 80 during the period examined to 843 today! Many of these markets are thin and subject to price manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manipulation happened primarily via two bots, Markus and Willy, that seemed to be performing valid trades but did not actually own the bitcoin they were using. During the Mt. Gox hack a number of these bots were able to create fake trades and make off with millions while manipulating the price of BTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicly reported trading volume at Mt. Gox included the fraudulent transactions, thereby signaling to the market that heavy trading activity was taking place. Indeed, the paper later shows that even if the fraudulent activity is set aside, average trading volume on all major exchanges trading bitcoins and USD was much higher on days the bots were active. The associated increase in “non-bot” trading was, of course, profitable for Mt. Gox, since it collected transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Willy Bot likely served another purpose as well. A theory, initially espoused in a Reddit post shortly after Mt. Gox’s collapse (Anonymous, 2014b), is that hackers stole a huge number (approximately 650,000) of bitcoins from Mt. Gox in June 2011 and that the exchange owner Mark Karpales took extraordinary steps to cover up the loss for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is simple: if Bitcoin wants to be taken seriously it probably shouldn’t be this easy or legal to manipulate the markets. While decentralization is supposed to replace regulation it’s clear that there is still a way to go before it can be truly taken seriously. “As mainstream finance invests in cryptocurrency assets and as countries take steps toward legalizing bitcoin as a payment system (as Japan did in April 2017), it is important to understand how susceptible cryptocurrency markets are to manipulation. Our study provides a first examination,” write the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Yuzu – Nintendo Switch Emulator</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/yuzu-emu/yuzu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4cb736274fea28e3a2584b80afddb3da04027bd1/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f79757a752d656d752f79757a752e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572&quot; alt=&quot;Travis CI Build Status&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/yuzu-emu/yuzu.svg?branch=master&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of &lt;a href=&quot;https://citra-emu.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Citra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS. The emulator is currently only useful for homebrew development and research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore is generally only useful for running/debugging homebrew applications. At this time, yuzu does not run any commercial Switch games. yuzu can boot some games, to varying degrees of success, but does not implement any of the necessary GPU features to render 3D graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yuzu is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://yuzu-emu.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For development discussion, please join us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/XQV6dn9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the development happens on GitHub. It's also where &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu&quot;&gt;our central repository&lt;/a&gt; is hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to contribute please take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;Contributor's Guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Developer-Information&quot;&gt;Developer Information&lt;/a&gt;. You should as well contact any of the developers on Discord in order to know about the current state of the emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We happily accept monetary donations or donated games and hardware. Please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://yuzu-emu.org/donate/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;donations page&lt;/a&gt; for more information on how you can contribute to yuzu. Any donations received will go towards things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switch consoles to explore and reverse-engineer the hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch games for testing, reverse-engineering, and implementing new features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web hosting and infrastructure setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software licenses (e.g. Visual Studio, IDA Pro, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional hardware (e.g. GPUs as-needed to improve rendering support, other peripherals to add support for, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also more than gladly accept used Switch consoles, preferably ones with firmware 3.0.0 or lower! If you would like to give yours away, don't hesitate to join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/VXqngT3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; and talk to bunnei.

&lt;p name=&quot;dac1&quot; id=&quot;dac1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I’ve been interested in the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Myers&lt;/strong&gt;–&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Briggs Type Indicator&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;MBTI&lt;/strong&gt;) for a while now. While I don’t see it as prescriptive or even all that scientific, it has been a helpful framework for empathizing with people who are different than I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;61f4&quot; id=&quot;61f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What many personality nerds don’t realize is that the MBTI system is based on something called &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Cognitive Functions&lt;/em&gt;. These functions were created by the father of modern phycology, Carl Jung, back in the 1920s. I wanted to dive a little deeper and learn more about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b1ec&quot; id=&quot;b1ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At the same time, I was watching HBO’s West World and saw this screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;85ce&quot; id=&quot;85ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;While I love these kind of Sci-Fi UIs, which is what immediately caught my attention, I thought, what if I could build a “host profile” of anyone based on their MBTI traits? Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e58&quot; id=&quot;6e58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To prepare for this, I read the “MBTI Bible”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gifts-Differing-Understanding-Personality-Type/dp/089106074X&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gifts-Differing-Understanding-Personality-Type/dp/089106074X&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gifts Differing by Myers and Briggs&lt;/a&gt; and started hacking on building out a system that could generate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;radar chart&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt; underlying the MBTI system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7017&quot; id=&quot;7017&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the end, I pivoted away from the West World UI a bit since I (and other beta testers) found a lot more utility in the ability to overlay multiple people on the radar chart to get a sense of chemistry amongst a group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba42&quot; id=&quot;ba42&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The results are really interesting if I do say so myself. Try entering you team’s personality types or you and your spouse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;15.16393442623&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c650&quot; id=&quot;c650&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I’ve worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheetcake.cc&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sheetcake.cc&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheetcake&lt;/a&gt; for a few years now on the side. It has a very small set of loyal users (most of which know me or someone close to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1c4d&quot; id=&quot;1c4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some fun facts about SheetCake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;be82&quot; id=&quot;be82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I wrote the first version in 48 hours back in 2012 for a hackathon. Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5jsxlQr37Q&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5jsxlQr37Q&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video of younger me&lt;/a&gt; demoing the 48 hour version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d4a7&quot; id=&quot;d4a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I’ve re-written it 4 times! First version was in Backbone.js + Node.js. Second was Backbone + Marionette + Firebase. Third was React + Firebase (all in CoffeeScript) and the 4th and final version was ES6, React, and Firebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d798&quot; id=&quot;d798&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;People who use Sheetcake tend to use it consistently for years; however, there is no business model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;554c&quot; id=&quot;554c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Sheetcake actually works really well for certain types of things (like those Zero Day signups) so I wanted to create a landing page for it that marketed some of the benefits. I started from a template on this one but here’s where it landed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1db2&quot; id=&quot;1db2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Early in the year, chat bots were all the rage. While I’ve never been optimistic that chat bots will go anywhere on their own, the conversational A.I. aspect of them was intriguing to me and I wanted to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f13b&quot; id=&quot;f13b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m an introvert and generally pretty bad at sharing anything about myself so I thought it might be fun to create an extroverted bot that could answer simple questions about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;f582&quot; id=&quot;f582&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;NeTi get’s his name from the cognitive functions I would have if I were an extrovert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1c90&quot; id=&quot;1c90&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The A.I. part of classifying the question intents is built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wit.ai/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://wit.ai/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wit.ai&lt;/a&gt; which made it pretty easy.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b861&quot; id=&quot;b861&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After researching a bit more, the really compelling part about this methodology was not so much how convincing the results were, but how simple and elegant the solution was (especially compared to a more standard A.I. approach like Finite State Machines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;177d&quot; id=&quot;177d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So for April’s project I made a JavaScript library to explore GOAP. A basic implementation turned out to be surprisingly simple (only 58 lines of code!).&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/tronprotocol/java-tron/issues/25</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joem789&quot; class=&quot;user-mention&quot;&gt;@joem789&lt;/a&gt; Your statements and &quot;arguments&quot; sound like a string of horrid jokes. I know you hold a sizeable amount of their shit tokens, but come on. If you're going to make an attempt at an argument, as least make it slightly reasonable and involving less straight up stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people born into entitlement thinking they own their own ideas. To you copying is stealing. To others copying is reproducing something to learn from it. When an American copies a software program it becomes &quot;reverse engineering&quot; for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, you have no idea what 'copying' means in this context. First of all, we're not dealing with ideas here. Ethereum is an IMPLEMENTATION of an idea, not an idea. There's a difference between stealing an implementation (literally copy/paste source code) vs copying an idea. H.U.G.E .. DIFFERENCE. There's a reason why there are things called patents, intellectual property, and billions of dollars in IP lawsuits every year by companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your &quot;logic&quot; was true, every company would be stealing from each other blatantly and indiscriminately, and nothing could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'copying' you are trying to (and fail) to refer to is when a company sees a product that is gaining a lot of traction, and says &quot;hey, we could create a product with pretty much the same features. Let's do it.&quot; Ahem, Instagram Stories features being derived from Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;I'm just going to copy and paste code from some other codebase and claim it as my own. Herpa Derp.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try Googling China and Plagiarism and learn something about a culture that's not your own. Maybe then you will understand what is really happening here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are ... you seriously trying to justify this by pulling some kind of nonsensical &quot;culture&quot; card?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let them be! It's their culture! Learn more about their plagiaristic culture and you'll then respect what the Tron team has done.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not plagiarism itself is rampant throughout China, you talk about it as if it's something that's good and should be revered. Wat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody needs you complainers here slowing down progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that progress is copy/pasta code from other codebases and claiming it as your own, you better bet your butt people are going to complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obstacles that are in place can be and will be overcome with a little more time. Give it a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? Do you stray onto a different topic? It sounds like you're now addressing people who are pissed about ... slow development time? I don't see how this has anything to do with anything that was stated prior.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rents dropping significantly across the Seattle area after new construction</title>
<link>https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-area-rents-drop-significantly-for-first-time-this-decade-as-new-apartments-sit-empty/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-area-rents-drop-significantly-for-first-time-this-decade-as-new-apartments-sit-empty/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Rents are dropping significantly across the Seattle area for the first time this decade, as a flood of new construction has left apartments sitting empty in Seattle’s hottest neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average rent across King and Snohomish counties dipped 2.9 percent in December compared with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-rent-hikes-slow-amid-apartment-boom-but-average-two-bedroom-tops-2000/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;prior quarter,&lt;/a&gt; according to a new quarterly landlord survey by Apartment Insights/RealData.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rents sometimes drop by a few bucks this time of year. But the latest quarterly drop is the biggest this decade by far, and amounted to a savings of about $50 a month for the average renter across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In neighborhoods in and around downtown Seattle, the dip equates to an average of $100 in monthly savings for renters signing new leases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest rent decreases were mostly in the popular Seattle neighborhoods that are getting the most new apartments. Rents dipped more than 6 percent compared with the prior quarter in First Hill, downtown Seattle, Belltown, South Lake Union and Ballard, along with Redmond and the Sammamish/Issaquah area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;article-aside show-mobile show-tablet show-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-profile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-profile-content&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kuow.org/post/rents-seattle-are-dropping-heres-why&quot;&gt;Kim Malcolm of KUOW talks with Seattle Times reporter Mike Rosenberg about why rents have been declining in the Seattle area.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with a year earlier, rents still increased 4.5 percent regionwide, but that was the slowest year-over-year growth since 2011 and down from the double-digit increases that became common over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slowdown comes as the number of new apartments opening across the area has hit record levels and has begun to significantly outpace the number of new renters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More apartments are sitting empty — particularly throughout downtown Seattle — giving renters more negotiating power over landlords. And even more new apartments are set to open in 2018, leading analysts to suggest the rental market will keep cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renters have been waiting for relief for a long time. Rents across the region had soared 48 percent over the previous five years, adding an extra $550 a month to a typical renter’s bills. The Seattle area led the nation in rent hikes in 2016 and early 2017, according to Zillow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now incomes are rising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.attomdata.com/news/affordability/2018-rental-affordability-report/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;content-link external&quot;&gt;faster than rents&lt;/a&gt;, following a similar trend that had already taken place &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/rent-hikes-slow-around-the-country-but-surge-again-in-seattle-whats-going-on/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;in other big cities&lt;/a&gt; over the prior few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;article-aside show-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;module story-list related-stories&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Frankly, Seattle is the last of the really big markets to see this (cool-down) trend develop. It’s stayed at the top a lot longer than anywhere else,” said Greg Willett, chief economist for the rental data firm RealPage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He cited strong job and population growth as the reason Seattle surged for so long. That demand continues to be healthy, but now supply of new apartments is growing even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willett predicts rent growth for the next few years will be about 3 percent a year, or similar to inflation, mirroring predictions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/research/hottest-housing-markets-2018-17852/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;content-link external&quot;&gt;from Zillow&lt;/a&gt; and other websites that track the local market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;break&quot;&gt;Renters, developers take notice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers and banks that lend money for new construction have taken notice of the market cooling. While tons of new buildings are already approved or under construction now, the pipeline for future projects that exist only on paper is shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Smith, CEO of developer Urban Visions, said he just turned down an offer to build a new high-rise because construction costs have risen so much and rents are no longer keeping pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New projects don’t make sense — they don’t pencil” out, Smith said. “Most banks are aware of that now and are very, very cautious about the amount of debt they’ll put on a property. There’s definitely a change that has occurred. Some fellow developers are stepping back and saying, ‘I’m not developing now.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For renters, it’s still no picnic out there. But several renters who have been looking for apartments recently said they’ve noticed things at least weren’t as bad as they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie Zacharkiw said she just signed a new lease Wednesday, and got the first apartment she looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I ended up at a one-bedroom in Wallingford for $1,400 month, which I’m still a bit shocked about,” she said, noting she expected to pay $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grant Slemp and his wife moved from Redmond to one of the new South Lake Union buildings last month. “Prices were a little lower than I was expecting, which was nice,” he said. Still, they were delayed when the first unit they looked at was rented out by someone else before they could put in an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle remains among the most expensive places in the country to rent. The average rent across all unit types is $2,330 in downtown Seattle, $2,180 in West Bellevue, $2,120 in South Lake Union and $2,050 in Belltown, according to Apartment Insights/RealData.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end, rents remain below $1,300 in SeaTac, Des Moines and Tukwila, and below $1,500 in most of Snohomish County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;break&quot;&gt;Amazonia apartment frenzy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vacancy rate across the region grew 0.8 percentage points to 5.4 percent in December — the highest since 2010 — a sign that supply has outgained demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In South Lake Union, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/resurgent-south-lake-union-still-awaiting-its-dinner-crowd/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;developers have been gung-ho&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/thanks-to-amazon-seattle-is-now-americas-biggest-company-town/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;Amazon’s rapid growth&lt;/a&gt;, so many new apartments have opened up in recent years that the vacancy rate increased from 4.6 percent to 7.1 percent (the figure excludes brand-new buildings just starting to lease up). That’s a huge jump that gives the neighborhood the second-highest vacancy rate in the region, behind the Everett/Mukilteo area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-methode&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;facthead&quot;&gt;About the data — and rental survey news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, The Seattle Times, other media organizations and official sources like city governments have relied on two competing landlord survey groups for information on the local rental market: Apartment Insights Washington, and Dupre + Scott. The Times has cited those firms’ data in more than 100 stories in the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They periodically survey virtually all local rental-property owners to produce more accurate and thorough statistics than websites that rely on algorithms and online listings to gather stats like average rents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Apartment Insights Washington owner Tom Cain said he was selling to business partners in Phoenix that put out similar reports in other markets. In December, Mike Scott and Patty Dupre announced they were retiring and closing Dupre + Scott for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Apartment Insights owners plan to put out quarterly reports updating the data Cain has long released, starting with the fourth- quarter statistics used in this story. They are switching to the brand name of Apartment Insights/RealData, but there are no methodology changes. Information from Dupre + Scott will no longer be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the brand-new buildings in South Lake Union, about one-third of apartments are sitting empty. And in the core of downtown, about two-thirds of newly opened apartments are vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flood of open apartments in South Lake Union suggests many of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/thanks-to-amazon-seattle-is-now-americas-biggest-company-town/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;thousands of new workers&lt;/a&gt; filing into Amazon’s campus each year are choosing to live in other neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are 24,500 apartments under construction now across King and Snohomish counties. There are an additional 35,000 units in the pipeline, although not all of those will get built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city of Seattle is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattles-record-apartment-boom-is-ready-to-explode/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;getting more apartments&lt;/a&gt; this decade than in the prior 50 years combined. For the Puget Sound region as a whole, the current construction frenzy rivals the record apartment boom from the late 1980s, which was centered in the suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate Apartment Insights/RealData report found the average rent across Pierce, Kitsap and Thurston counties was just under $1,200 per unit in the fourth quarter. Rents in those areas were up slightly from the previous quarter and grew 7.8 percent from the previous year, indicating the South Sound rental market is now significantly hotter than King County, even as it remains a much more affordable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rental slowdown runs counter to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/eastside-home-prices-surge-to-new-record-capitol-hill-area-hits-1-million-median/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;for-sale housing market&lt;/a&gt;, where home prices continue to shoot up unabated at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-extends-its-run-as-the-nations-hottest-housing-market/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;fastest rate in the country&lt;/a&gt;. A key difference is that there are very few new single-family homes being built in the region, in contrast to the frenzy of apartment construction.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>With rent hikes already slowing down and even more apartments set to open in 2018 and 2019, renters will gain more power to negotiate with landlords.</og:description>

&lt;p&gt;This course will prepare students to interview for software engineering and related internships and full-time positions in industry. Drawing on multiple sources of actual interview questions, students will learn key problem-solving strategies specific to the technical/coding interview. Students will be encouraged to synthesize information they have learned across different courses in the major. Emphasis will be on the oral and combination written-oral modes of communication common in coding interviews, but which are an unfamiliar settings for problem solving for many students.&lt;/p&gt;
