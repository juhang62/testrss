<title>Show HN: ZFS Implementation in Python</title>
<link>https://github.com/alcarithemad/zfsp</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/alcarithemad/zfsp</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZFS, in Python, without reading the original C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many hours spent staring at hexdumps, and asking friends to search the internet for explanations of various features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like it might be a fun project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pipfile lists the dependencies; there aren't many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3.5+ is required, but 3.6 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, as PyPy runs this code much, much faster (around 4x on the test suite) and didn't support 3.6 until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pipenv install -e .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.B.: &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; gets you an &quot;editable&quot; install; changes to the source tree will affect the installed package's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test Suite.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the test suite requires one-time access to a system with ZFS, to generate the test pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;tests/fixtures.sh&lt;/code&gt; on such a system and make the resulting directory &lt;code&gt;tests/fixtures&lt;/code&gt; (this is where it will end up if you run &lt;code&gt;fixtures.sh&lt;/code&gt; directly from the &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; directory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests themselves can be run with &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;. Most of the tests pass, but there are some known failures. Feel free to try fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests are heavily parameterized and attempt to run all tests against all relevant pool variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zexplore&lt;/code&gt; is the main command line interface. It's reasonably well documented (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a subcommand for some limited FUSE support, which depends on &lt;code&gt;fusepy&lt;/code&gt; (developed with &lt;code&gt;2.0.4&lt;/code&gt;). This is not installed by default in the Pipfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ zexplore label -p tests/fixtures/feature_large_blocks
{b'errata': 0,
 b'features_for_read': {},

                b'type': b'file'},

$ zexplore objset -p tests/fixtures/nested_datasets -P 1
{'config': 27,
 'creation_version': 5000,
 'deflate': 1,
 'feature_descriptions': 30,
 'features_for_read': 28,
 'features_for_write': 29,
 'free_bpobj': 11,
 'history': 32,
 'root_dataset': 2,
 'sync_bplist': 31}

$ zexplore ls -p tests/fixtures/nested_datasets /n1/n2/n3

y

$ zexplore cat -p tests/fixtures/nested_datasets /gzip-9/gzip-9 | head -n 5
A
a
aa
aal
aalii
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things won't work, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;raidz with more than 4 disks will probably fail with an inscrutable error. ZFS uses a magic allocation function that's a non-linear black box. I haven't figured it out. raidz where the disks are larger than a few GB will probably also fail, but I haven't tested that at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new feature flags have come out since I last worked on this seriously, and those features are (obviously) not supported. That's things like (incomplete list):
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SHA-512/256&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spacemap_v2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some feature flags that did exist when I was actively working on this are not implemented, either because I failed to figure out how they work, or because I didn't get around to trying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pyndata is the struct description library used to read all the on-disk structures. I wrote it first, and it's bad. If I was doing this again today, I'd probably build something with dataclasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alcarithemad/rlzjb&quot;&gt;Rust implementation of LZJB&lt;/a&gt; which is not currently included, but decompression is not the bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Update Regarding Add-Ons in Firefox</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Late on Friday May 3rd, we became aware of an issue with Firefox that prevented existing and new add-ons from running or being installed. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to people who use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team has identified and rolled-out a fix for all Firefox Desktop users on Release, Beta and Nightly. The fix will be automatically applied in the background within the next few hours. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/#workarounds&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No active steps need to be taken to make add-ons work again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In particular, please do not delete and/or re-install any add-ons as an attempt to fix the issue. Deleting an add-on removes any data associated with it, where disabling and re-enabling does not.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; The fix does not apply to Firefox ESR or Firefox for Android. We’re working on releasing a fix for both, and will provide updates here and on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide this fix on short notice, we are using the Studies system. This system is enabled by default, and no action is needed &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; Studies have been disabled. Firefox users can check if they have Studies enabled by going to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firefox Options/Preferences -&amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp; Security -&amp;gt; Allow Firefox to install and run studies (scroll down to find the setting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-8663&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1363&quot; height=&quot;857&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs.png 1363w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs-252x158.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs-768x483.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs-600x377.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1363px) 100vw, 1363px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Studies can be disabled again after the add-ons have been re-enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may take up to six hours for the Study to be applied to Firefox. To check if the fix has been applied, you can enter “about:studies” in the location bar. If the fix is in the active, you’ll see “hotfix-update-xpi-signing-intermediate-bug-1548973” in either the &lt;em&gt;Active studies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Completed studies&lt;/em&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-8664&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1064&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies.png 1064w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies-252x161.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies-768x491.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies-600x383.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1064px) 100vw, 1064px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also see “hotfix-reset-xpi-verification-timestamp-1548973” listed, which is part of the fix and may be in the &lt;em&gt;Active studies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Completed studies&lt;/em&gt; section(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a general fix that doesn’t use the Studies system and will keep this blog post updated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll continue to provide updates on continued efforts on this post, and will share a more substantial update in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updates:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clarified that the Studies fix applies only to Desktop users of Firefox distributed by Mozilla. Firefox ESR, Firefox for Android, and some versions of Firefox included with Linux distributions will require separate updates. (May 4, 12:03 EST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re aware that some users are reporting that their extensions remain disabled with both studies active. We’re tracking this issue on Bugzilla in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1549078&quot;&gt;bug 1549078&lt;/a&gt;. (May 4, 12:03 EST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified that the study may appear in either the &lt;em&gt;Active studies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Completed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;studies&lt;/em&gt; of “about:studies” (May 4, 12:10 EST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the post to clarify that deleting extensions can result in data loss, and should not be used to attempt a fix. (May 4, 12:58 EST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporarily disabled commenting on this post given volume and duplication. They’ll be re-enabled as more updates become available. (May 4, 13:02 EST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a number of work-arounds being discussed in the community. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are not recommended as they may conflict with fixes we are deploying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll let you know when further updates are available that we recommend, and appreciate your patience. (May 4, 15:01 EST)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>500 days of Duolingo: What you can and can’t learn from a language app</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/smarter-living/500-days-of-duolingo-what-you-can-and-cant-learn-from-a-language-app.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/smarter-living/500-days-of-duolingo-what-you-can-and-cant-learn-from-a-language-app.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If mobile language-learning apps are to be believed, it’s never been easier to pick up another language. Just spend 20 minutes a day with a few virtual flashcards and you’ll be fluent in no time! The reality is a lot more nuanced — and arguably more disappointing — than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apps like &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.memrise.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Memrise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.babbel.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Babbel&lt;/a&gt; all promise to teach you how to read, write, or speak a new language, all from your phone. While they’re similar in concept, they differ a lot in the specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-1p7a59k ez3869y0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Duolingo offers a skill tree of lessons that use listening exercises, flashcards, and multiple choice questions to drill you on new words, phrases, and sentences. Most questions have a comment thread where users can discuss a particular question in detail. The service also has community features that let you connect with other people who are learning the same language you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Memrise offers similar lessons to Duolingo, introducing new words and phrases with flashcards, listening exercises, and more. However, the app has a few unique features: on new words, you can write a note (called a “mem”) with anything that helps you remember the new word or phrase. These will appear later when you come across the word again. It also offers a feature called Learn With Locals, which pairs words with videos of native speakers saying the phrase out loud and demonstrating the phrase. For example, a speaker might shiver when describing cold weather. This helps connect words with their meaning. Memrise also offers more explanatory cards than Duolingo offers when introducing new or complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Babbel is different from the other two. While it uses similar multiple choice or listening exercises as the others, it uses conversational examples to demonstrate how to use new words or phrases when speaking with another person. It also offers a speech recognition feature that lets you speak words back during an exercise instead of writing them out or answering a multiple choice question. This helps you learn how to pronounce words properly, or at least properly enough for your phone to recognize what you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Despite their differences, they have the same goal: use daily exercises on your phone to teach you an entire language. It’s an enticing promise, especially if you’re not already immersed in a culture or education system that will give you the exposure you need to pick up a second language. The question is, are they effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After I accumulated a Duolingo streak in excess of 500 days — a feat that, thanks to the app’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tehawesome/status/719658102887305216?lang=en&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;notoriously insistent reminders&lt;/a&gt;, has now come to define my self-worth — I found myself in a better place to judge just how much an app alone can really teach you. The short answer is that you can definitely learn &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; things from an app, but if you want to become fluent in a language — or even conversational — they won’t be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-dwo1qx eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-71a5183f&quot;&gt;Language apps are great for writing systems and basic phrases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The phrase “learning a language” is deceptively reductive. A language isn’t a singular monolith, but rather a complex interconnected system of components that build a way to communicate. The lexicon consists of the individual words, which speakers have to memorize. The syntax and grammar tell speakers how to properly structure those words in a sentence. Then there’s the writing system, which is the visual representation of words or sounds that allow words to be constructed (for example, in English, the writing system is the alphabet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For languages that have a different writing system, like Japanese, Russian, or Korean, language apps can be an excellent way to learn. Duolingo and Memrise both use a combination of flash card and simple matching exercises to train you to recognize symbols in a new writing system, while Babbel goes an extra step further with in-lesson explanations for how new symbols or sounds work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After a few weeks or months of consistently going through lessons, it’s feasible to learn every sound and symbol in a new writing system. You won’t be able to understand every word you can read, but you’ll be a lot closer than if you started from scratch. However, that’s only part of learning a language. Understanding the alphabet used in English doesn’t inherently mean you can understand French or Spanish, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These apps are also better at teaching &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/travel/language-tips-apps.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;basic conversational phrases&lt;/a&gt; that are useful when you’re traveling. When you visit a city in a foreign country, it’s helpful to learn a few phrases like “Where is the bathroom?” or “How much does it cost?” Using a phrase book to memorize these phrases in another language is a quick and dirty way to get the job done, but that’s not really “learning” the phrases, it’s just memorizing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For example, consider the Italian phrase “Dov’è il bagno?” This phrase means “Where is the bathroom?” However, without speaking Italian, can you tell which part of that sentence is “bathroom?” Could you adapt the sentence to say “Where is the door?” or “Where is the hotel?” Language apps don’t just teach you whole sentences. Instead, they break down component parts of a sentence and teach you a few different variations so you understand what you’re saying and can adjust what you’re saying based on your situation. It’s a useful skill to have, especially when traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most importantly, though, these apps are powerful reminders that learning a new language isn’t a part-time job. Duolingo has infamously persistent notifications that pester you to come back and give that adorable green bird attention every single day. The downside is that it can be tempting to gamify the experience, rather than actually learn. On particularly busy days, I’ve found myself redoing the earliest lessons just to keep my all-important streak going. Which leads to another important lesson: skirting the rules on a self-improvement project hurts no one but yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-dwo1qx eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3809a96d&quot;&gt;What language apps can’t teach you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For as useful as learning a new writing system or understanding basic phrases can be, it’s only a small part of fluency in a language. What counts as “fluent” is a tough concept to describe, but the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/cefr/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Common European Framework of Reference for Languages&lt;/a&gt; (or CEFR) is a widely-accepted standard for approximating fluency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The six CEFR levels are necessarily broad and can overlap a bit, but here’s a (very) brief overview of what each means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-1p7a59k ez3869y0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At level A1, learners should know basic phrases, be able to introduce themselves and ask simple personal questions, and understand basic interactions if their conversation partner speaks slowly. Level A2 includes understanding common expressions, communicating about routine tasks, and describing simple aspects of the speaker’s background. Together, these two levels make up the Basic stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Level B1 starts to introduce more complex ideas like explaining their opinions, dreams, and ambitions, or handling complex tasks while traveling. Level B2 expects speakers to be able to speak with native speakers of a language without straining, and have complex technical discussions related to their field of expertise. These two levels make up the Independent stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, a level C1 speaker should be able to communicate flexibly in social, professional, and academic settings, understand a wide variety of topics, and recognize implicit meaning. C2, the highest level, expects the learner to “understand with ease virtually everything heard or read,” and summarize information from different sources. Levels C1 and C2 make up the Proficient stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If it’s not already obvious, language apps simply can’t get someone to level C2 — or anywhere close — on their own. There simply aren’t lessons to teach you, for example, how to have a complex conversation about banking regulations or astrophysics or whatever your field of expertise. It also means that if you stick solely to the lesson plans in each app, you won’t communicate with another person. By definition, these two limitations would rule out reaching even level B2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some apps also have a hard time teaching complex grammar. In Japanese, for one small example, “particles” are core parts of a sentence that indicate how words relate to each other in a sentence. They’re usually written with the same symbols used to spell words — sort of like how “a” is both a letter, but also a word on its own — which can get confusing since Japanese doesn’t use spaces between words and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Duolingo often just drops a new particle on you without much explanation of what it does or even that it’s a particle at all. Memrise handles this a bit better, with lessons dedicated to how certain particles and grammar work, but it helps to have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;external lessons&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor, or best of all a native speaker to help explain some of the finer points of nuance in a language’s grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Language apps also struggle with some of the unspoken aspects of communicating in a language. To focus on Japanese again, there are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wa-pedia.com/language/politeness_japanese.shtml&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;distinct levels of formality and politeness&lt;/a&gt; which dictate what form a word should take based on your relationship with the person you’re speaking to. So, for example, you may use one form of a sentence when speaking to a friend, but a more formal version when speaking to a boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Furthermore, body language and posture can have a dramatic impact on how your speech is perceived, and language apps tend not to cover this at all. While understanding body language is not strictly a requirement of any CEFR level, it’s hard to navigate a conversation fluently without a general understanding of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/magazine/03wwln-safire-t.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;what certain gestures mean&lt;/a&gt;, or what actions are impolite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most importantly, though, language apps are not other humans. It sounds like an obvious observation, but the entire point of learning a language is to communicate with other people. You can learn as many words or sentences as you want, but until you’re able to have a conversation with another person, you’ll never be fluent. Or, according to the CEFR model, you won’t even be halfway there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For that reason alone, learning a language with an app should be a starting point, not the end. If you make it through an entire Duolingo skill tree or a Memrise lesson plan, it might be time to upgrade to an in-person class, or you might want to find a native speaker to practice with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Repositories held for ransom by using valid credentials</title>
<link>https://about.gitlab.com/2019/05/03/suspicious-git-activity-security-update/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.gitlab.com/2019/05/03/suspicious-git-activity-security-update/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We've learned of suspicious git activity using valid credentials (a password or personal access token) on GitLab. We identified the source based on a support ticket filed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/209448/gitlab-account-hacked-and-repo-wiped&quot;&gt;Stefan Gabos&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and immediately began investigating the issue. This is a user insecure practices issue, and is not specific to GitLab, as other git repositories are affected by this as well. We are issuing this advisory to all git repo users so that we can help heighten awareness of this issue and help git's user community protect their own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breaches seem to rely on the attacker having knowledge of the affected users passwords in order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-is-wiping-git-repositories-and-asking-for-a-ransom/&quot;&gt;to wipe their Git repositories and hold them for ransom&lt;/a&gt;. We have notified affected GitLab users and are working as quickly as possible to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As a result of our investigation, we have strong evidence that the compromised accounts have account passwords being stored in plaintext on a deployment of a related repository. We strongly encourage the use of password management tools to store passwords in a more secure manner, and enabling two-factor authentication wherever possible, both of which would have prevented this issue.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;- Kathy Wang, Senior Director, Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-you-can-protect-yourself&quot;&gt;How you can protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These breaches seemed to rely on the attacker having knowledge of the affected user’s password. We highly recommend strong passwords and unique passwords for everything (using a good password manager helps manage this). We strongly recommend all GitLab users enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.html&quot;&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/&quot;&gt;SSH keys&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen your GitLab account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may further protect your groups by applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/two_factor_authentication.html#enforcing-2fa-for-all-users-in-a-group&quot;&gt;“Require all users in this group to setup Two-factor authentication”&lt;/a&gt; setting in the Group settings under “Permissions, LFS, 2FA”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it can help to prevent a breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitigation&quot;&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that no data has been lost, unless the owner/maintainer of the repository did not have a local copy and the GitLab copy was the only one. In some cases, repository files were changed. After updating account credentials, we recommend making use of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; commands to restore your repository to its previous state. If you have a full current copy of the repository on your computer, you can force push to the current HEAD of your local copy using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin HEAD:master --force&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you can still clone the repository and make use of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is related to the use of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, GitLab does not have its own documentation or examples, but we have found these articles that may be of use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 2, 2019 at approximately 10:00pm GMT GitLab received the first report of a repository being wiped with a single file left in place that demanded a bitcoin ransom be paid for the return of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;To recover your lost data and avoid leaking it: Send us 0.1 Bitcoin (BTC) to our Bitcoin address 1ES14c7qLb5CYhLMUekctxLgc1FV2Ti9DA and contact us by Email at admin@gitsbackup.com with your Git login and a Proof of Payment. If you are unsure if we have your data, contact us and we will send you a proof. Your code is downloaded and backed up on our servers. If we dont receive your payment in the next 10 Days, we will make your code public or use them otherwise.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began to receive multiple reports, and were able to search through logs and repositories to determine the extent of the impact. A few repositories had the ransom threat left behind, some repositories were simply wiped, and a few accounts appeared to be successfully accessed by the attacker but not modified. All total, 131 users and 163 repositories were, at a minimum, accessed by the attacker. Affected accounts were temporarily disabled, and the owners were notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed the following items in reference to this incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The source IP of the attacks came from the 185.234.216.0/24 range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attacker appeared to use some type of “update script” in an attempt to perform the accesses, and the nature of the individual accesses strongly suggested the use of plaintext passwords that were locally stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually all of the repositories were private repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the accounts impacted had two-factor authentication enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since not all of the accesses resulted in both a repository wipe and a ransom note, this suggests that the attacker’s update script was possibly not working properly. This could be a result of a generic script being used against GitLab as well as GitHub and Bitbucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuing our investigation, and if we uncover more details that we feel will benefit our users and the security community at large, we will communicate that information as quickly and as transparently as possible. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our security and would appreciate any comments and questions you might have.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Negotiations Failed: How Oracle Killed Java EE</title>
<link>https://headcrashing.wordpress.com/2019/05/03/negotiations-failed-how-oracle-killed-java-ee/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://headcrashing.wordpress.com/2019/05/03/negotiations-failed-how-oracle-killed-java-ee/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today Eclipse Foundation’s president Mike Milinkovic blogged about the final result of the confidential trademark negotiations between Oracle and the Eclipse Foundation. As we remember, Oracle announced that Java EE will be open sourced to that organization and it would become true open source. After 18 months of intensive negotiations the effort has come to an end: It failed. There will be no trademark agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason simply spoken is, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/boardminutes/2019_03_26_Minutes.pdf&quot;&gt;recent board meeting minutes&lt;/a&gt;, that Oracle wanted to have in turn a set of inacceptable demands. Some of them would put the existence of the Eclipse Foundation at severe risk. Oracle claimed that products distributed by the Eclipse Foundation (like the Eclipse IDE) must &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be bundled with Java runtimes certified particularly &lt;em&gt;by Oracle and its licencees&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;not any other&lt;/em&gt; vendor’s certification and not any uncertified runtime. Hence, the IDE and GlassFish wouldn’t be vendor-neutral products anymore. This restriction was not told at the start of the negotations, it was introduced much later, while the transfer was already in progress. One could assume that it was a reaction upon the donation of IBM’s OpenJ9 JVM, which is a clear threat to Oracle’s Java business. But once Eclipse products would be not vendor-neutral anymore, the EF’s tax exemption might become void, which would mean a financial fiasco, or possibly mean the end of the organization as a hole. Hence, it not only was &lt;em&gt;inacceptable&lt;/em&gt;, but it was simply &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to agree to Oracle’s requests, so the negotiations more or less completely failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is left over is not more but also not less the end of Java EE. The Eclipse Foundation may use some rather outdated code, but &lt;em&gt;must not modify&lt;/em&gt; it. If it gets modified, it must be &lt;em&gt;renamed&lt;/em&gt; – both, the project name (like JAX-RS, which is not nice but acceptable) but also &lt;em&gt;the package name&lt;/em&gt; (like javax.*), which means, existing applications will not run on the updated platform without recompilation of the application after intensive refactoring. Hence, it will become a completely new and incompatible platform, the worst case possible, as it not only voids the “WORA” (Write Once Run Anywhere) principle, it simply won’t happen in reality: After 18 months virtually no application vendor really wants to spend the time and money to update all customers with recompiled versions just for the sake of a renamed platform with a dubios future. The future is unclear because Oracle already started a blocking politics at the Eclipse Foundation’s board, where Oracle has a seat, and where &lt;em&gt;unanimous&lt;/em&gt; decisions are needed. Oracle now has the power, and apparently will use that power, to block the foundation’s future. It demonstrated that power already in a board meeting, where they had the sole vote against an otherwise unaimous move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current reaction of the Eclipse Foundation is to demonstrate success to rescue at least some value of the intensively marketed Jakarta trademark. But at what price? For what keeping a trademark that became an empty hull now? It now is not the successor of Java EE as a global standard anymore, it is just some framework made by some foundation, and users eventually will learn and draw conclusions. Currently plans have intensivated to rename everything ASAP. But who will actually jump on that train, when it implies changing all existing applications? Eclipse’s Mike Milinkovic still sees the future bright. For me, the glass is not just half-empty anymore: Today it cracked into pieces. This is the day when Java EE was killed by Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps to reproduce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait until it's past midnight on 2019-05-04 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All addons got disabled due not having valid signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expected results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the signature was due to expire, it should have been renewed weeks ago. Not all extensions were disabled. Fakespot and Google Scholar Button were left in their disabled state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reports on reddit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/bk54mu/addonsextensions_broken/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; says that they had their clocks a day forward, but they may be just early canaries for the actual widespread issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going backwards in time allows installation from AMO but do not remove the unsupported mark from the add ons already installed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon S3 will no longer support path-style API requests</title>
<link>https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=6776</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=6776</guid>
<description>Amazon S3 currently supports two request URI styles in all regions: path-style (also known as V1) that includes bucket name in the path of the URI (example: //s3.amazonaws.com//key), and virtual-hosted style (also known as V2) which uses the bucket name as part of the domain name (example: //.s3.amazonaws.com/key). In our effort to continuously improve customer experience, the path-style naming convention is being retired in favor of virtual-hosted style request format. Customers should update their applications to use the virtual-hosted style request format when making S3 API requests before September 30th, 2020 to avoid any service disruptions.

<title>You can’t judge housing affordability without knowing transportation costs</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “commonly accepted” 30 percent standard for judging housing affordability leaves out transportation and location&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At City Observatory, we’ve long been dissatisfied with commonly used measures of describing housing affordability. There are lots of reasons to believe that a single, fixed percentage of income standard does a poor job of reflecting whether housing is priced appropriately, and whether households are being asked to spend too much. We’ve explored some of these issues before, but today we want to focus on one key issue–the tradeoff between cheap rents and costly transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sprawl apologists tout the low housing prices of cities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.city-journal.org/html/battle-houston-16113.html&quot;&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, but invariably they leave out the fact that sprawling cities necessarily imply higher transportation costs. If you have to drive everywhere, and drive further for every trip, what you save in rent or mortgage payments, can be more than eaten up in car payments, gasoline purchases, and time wasted traveling. As we noted in our report on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityobservatory.org/introducing-the-sprawl-tax/&quot;&gt;Sprawl Tax&lt;/a&gt;, the added sprawl of cities like Houston cost the typical worker nearly $3,000 per year, not including the value of lost time. The same pattern also holds within housing markets as well as across them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In virtually every major urban real estate market, a major determinant of rent and housing prices is accessibility.  If you live in a dense, walkable urban neighborhood, you might manage to live quite comfortably not owning a car, or having just one car for a two-worker family.  If you live on the exurban edge, in a low density subdivision, you might need to own multiple cars just to manage the daily chores of school, shopping and play, as well as commuting to work. It turns out that the value of accessibility gets priced in to the walkable, well-located housing; and conversely, rental and for sale housing that’s located at a distance from everything is priced at a discount to the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means as a practical matter that you can’t judge whether an individual household’s living situation is affordable just by looking at whether they spend less than 30 percent of their income directly on housing. Consider this example: two otherwise identical households.  One lives in a suburb, owns two cars, and drives most places. They spend 30 percent of their income on housing and 20 percent of their income on transportation.  The second household lives in a city and owns one car.  Their house is more expensive than the suburban one, so they spend 40 percent of their income on housing, and just 10 percent on transportation. Is it really accurate to describe the second (city) household as any more “cost-burdened” than its suburban peer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the essential insight behind the Center for Neighborhood Technology’s “H+T” &lt;a href=&quot;http://htaindex.cnt.org/&quot;&gt;Housing and Transportation Index&lt;/a&gt;, which quantifies the approximate costs associated with housing and transportation in different neighborhoods. They’ve used census data on income and housing costs, and estimates of commuting patterns, transit available and car ownership to estimate what fraction of a household’s income gets spent on housing and transportation in different locations. They show that some neighborhoods with high housing costs are actually more affordable than lower rent areas, once you add in the savings in transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent report from the Joint Center on Housing Studies at Harvard shines a slightly different light on this question, by revealing differences in spending patterns among households. This report examines data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, which is constructed from spending diaries completed by a random sample of American households. We’ve taken their analysis from Table W-6, and reformatted it slightly, computing the share of total spending on housing and transportation for each income group.  We’ve also truncated the table to exclude a detailed breakout of other types of spending (food, apparel, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-4767&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/cityobservatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-16-16.59.52.png?resize=519%2C470&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;519&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/cityobservatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-16-16.59.52.png?w=519 519w, https://i1.wp.com/cityobservatory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screenshot-2017-06-16-16.59.52.png?resize=300%2C272 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consumer Expenditure Survey divides households into four quartiles according to household spending.  The lowest quartile spends the least (about $1,370 per month); the highest quartile spends about $9,300.  Within each quartile, the report divides households into three groups based on how much they spend on housing. Less than 30 percent is the group that is considered not-cost burdened by housing, 30 to 50 percent is cost-burdened by housing, and households spending more than 50 percent are severely cost burdened, according to this rubric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting to note here, is how, within each quartile, households that spend &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; on housing end up spending a great deal &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; on transportation.  Conversely, households that spend a larger fraction of their income on housing spend, on average much less on transportation. For example, households in the second quartile who spend less than 30 percent of their income on housing spend 12.6 percent of their income on transportation. That falls to less than 10 percent for those who are somewhat cost burdened, and less than 5 percent for those who are severely cost burdened. This pattern across income groups is consistent with the idea of a tradeoff between cheaper rents and higher transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its especially instructive to look at households in the highest spending quartile.  These are the 25 percent or so of most affluent households (as judged by their spending patterns), with monthly spending of about $9,300.  Households that spend less than 30 percent of their income on housing in this group spend $2,300 per month on transportation. Meanwhile, their peers with higher housing costs spend dramatically less on transportation ($400 to $600 per month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are important limitations to the Consumer Expenditure Survey data presented here. They aren’t adjusted for household size (small households tend to spend a larger fraction of their income on rent than larger ones), nor do they adjust for age, or exclude households who have paid of their mortgages (which also tends to dramatically affect reported household spending patterns). Nonetheless, the consumer spending data confirm that there’s a connection between lower rents and higher transportation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical implication is that we shouldn’t be talking about housing affordability in isolation. We should really be talking about “affordable living” rather than “affordable housing.” If your rent is low, but you have to spend a disproportionately large share of your income on transportation, then your living situation isn’t affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pornhub wants to buy Tumblr</title>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than two years after buying Tumblr as part of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/oath-verizon-completes-4-5-billion-buy-of-yahoo-and-merges-it-with-aol/&quot;&gt;Yahoo acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon is reportedly trying to sell the blogging platform. Pornhub has also announced that it wants to buy Tumblr and end the site's Verizon-imposed porn ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Verizon Communications Inc. is seeking a buyer for blogging website Tumblr, according to people familiar with the matter, as it tries to steady a media business that has struggled to meet revenue targets,&quot; The Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-looks-to-unload-tumblr-blogging-site-11556823135&quot;&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pornhub quickly announced its interest after the news broke, although it isn't clear whether the two companies have talked. Verizon &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/verizon-takes-aim-at-tumblrs-kneecaps-bans-all-adult-content/&quot;&gt;banned all adult content&lt;/a&gt; from Tumblr in December 2018, and Pornhub wants to restore the site to its former porn-filled glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are obvious synergies between the two brands and value Pornhub could derive from Tumblr,&quot; Pornhub VP Corey Price said in a statement to Ars. &quot;We’re extremely interested in acquiring the platform and are very much looking forward to one day restoring it to its former glory with NSFW content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked Pornhub if it has submitted an offer to buy Tumblr or at least spoken directly with Verizon about it, but we did not get an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tumblr was a safe haven for those who wanted to explore and express their sexuality, adult entertainment aficionados included,&quot; Price's statement also said. &quot;We’ve long been dismayed that such measures were taken to eradicate erotic communities on the platform, leaving many individuals without an asylum through which they could comfortably peruse adult content.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pornhub's interest in buying Tumblr was first reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/pornhub-interested-in-buying-tumblr&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon declined to comment when contacted by Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Verizon announced the Tumblr porn ban, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/tumblrs-porn-ban-is-going-about-as-badly-as-expected/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tumblr's algorithm for enforcing the ban was &quot;flagging non-adult content as adult content, and vice versa.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verizon’s Yahoo/AOL division&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WSJ report said Verizon's sale process for Tumblr &quot;is ongoing and may not result in any transaction,&quot; and that &quot;[i]t is unclear how much Verizon might get for Tumblr.&quot; The WSJ report didn't mention any potential buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/yahoo-will-purchase-tumblr-for-1-1-billion-according-to-wsj-report/&quot;&gt;Yahoo bought Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; for $1.1 billion in 2013, but it later &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/07/yahoo-may-not-have-screwed-tumblr-up-but-it-has-hemhorraged-money/&quot;&gt;wrote down about half of that value&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon bought Yahoo's operating business, including Tumblr, for $4.48 billion in June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon hoped Yahoo and previously acquired AOL would help it create a huge online advertising business. It hasn't gone well. Verizon laid off 7 percent of employees in the Yahoo/AOL division &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/verizon-cuts-7-percent-of-staff-in-failing-yahooaol-division/&quot;&gt;in January this year&lt;/a&gt;, a month after telling investors that the media division &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/12/verizon-cuts-10000-jobs-and-admits-its-yahooaol-division-is-a-failure/&quot;&gt;had &quot;lower-than-expected revenues and earnings&quot;&lt;/a&gt; as it lost ground to online advertising industry leaders Google and Facebook. Verizon recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of about $4.6 billion, wiping out nearly all of the Yahoo/AOL division's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/verizon-signals-its-yahoo-aol-divisions-are-almost-worthless-n946846&quot;&gt;goodwill value&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
