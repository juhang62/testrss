<title>European Parliament set to end EU-wide daylight savings</title>
<link>https://www.dw.com/en/european-parliament-set-to-end-eu-wide-daylight-savings/a-47775317</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.dw.com/en/european-parliament-set-to-end-eu-wide-daylight-savings/a-47775317</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Time is up for European Union-mandated daylight savings time. The European Commission and European Parliament have agreed on that. All the relevant committees in Parliament are for the change, according to Germany's conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) MEP Peter Liese, who has devoted a lot of time to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the lead committee on transport and tourism has given its blessing, by a large majority, EU lawmakers could vote on the change by the end of March. After that, all 28 member states will need to rubberstamp the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On German time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/eu-to-stop-changing-the-clocks-juncker-pledges/a-45300586&quot;&gt;European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's brash statement&lt;/a&gt; back in September, asserting that the amendment would go ahead quickly, has proven to be premature. At the time, Juncker was referring to an overwhelming response to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/eu-citizens-feel-times-up-for-changing-clocks/a-45263664&quot;&gt;EU online survey&lt;/a&gt;, where an unexpected 80 percent of respondents said the practice of changing the clock twice a year was outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;picBox medium&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;overlayLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/european-parliament-set-to-end-eu-wide-daylight-saving/a-47775317#&quot; link=&quot;/overlay/image/article/47775317/45068274&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;340&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dw.com/image/45068274_404.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The biggest Cuckoo clock in the world, in Germany's Black Forest.&quot; alt=&quot;The biggest Cuckoo clock in the world, in Germany's Black Forest. (picture-alliance/dpa/P. Seeger)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest Cuckoo clock in the world, in Germany's Black Forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the survey was not representative, with 3 million of the 4.6 million votes coming from Germany. This led to diplomats from smaller EU countries complaining behind closed doors that the European Commission wanted to impose German will on the other states through sheer populism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juncker was keen to abolish the twice-yearly time shift by spring, probably so he could claim, before European Parliament elections in May, that the will of the people had been reflected. But some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/eu-needs-more-time-before-ending-clock-changes/a-46078041&quot;&gt;member states demanded a transitional period up to 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good things come to those who wait, it seems, especially in the EU. As a compromise for the repeal of the &quot;Directive on summer time,&quot; spring or autumn in 2020 has now been suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/summertime-what-a-joke/a-45302669&quot;&gt;Summertime: What a joke!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU members taking their time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that by June EU states will have to draw the lines for each time zone and decide what time those places will set their clocks to, and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some EU members — including the United Kingdom, Greece and Portugal — want to stick to the old rules and continue to switch between summer and winter time through the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;picBox full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dw.com/image/45289822_7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Infographic of EU Timezones&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyprus, the Netherlands, Denmark, France and Ireland have not decided. The other states want to get rid of the twice-yearly change, but still have to decide which time will apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You need time to give the member states the opportunity to coordinate. It is really important that we don't have a total patchwork,&quot; German MEP Peter Liese, told DW. In the future, if you drive from Hamburg through the Netherlands and Belgium to France, you should only have to change the clock once, at most, not three times, Liese said. Airlines, railways and transport companies would have to make adjustments. &quot;But you don't need two years for that. It will be faster,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A changing Zeitgeist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be on the safe side, the European Parliament is calling for a &quot;coordination network&quot; of member states and, of course, an ombudsperson. It remains to be seen whether chaos will actually break out when the EU no longer sets the clock. As it stands, mandated EU-wide summer time has only existed since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zeitumstellung&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happened every in October and March — and might disappear in the future if the EU agrees on the measure: Zeitumstellung, or time change. Even if it feels horrible to give up an hour of sleep, keep in mind you'll get it back in the fall. Zeitumstellung at least gives a feeling of power — even if we are all bound by time, twice a year we act like we can change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zeitschrift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other German expressions integrate &quot;Zeit,&quot; the word for time. A &quot;Zeitschrift&quot; — literally, time writing, is simply a magazine. Whether it includes political discourse or scantily clad women (now with nipples covered), theoretically a magazine should keep up with the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zeitgeist can also be used in English, its direct translation — time spirit — conjures up images of Charles Dickens' Ghosts of Christmas Past and Present. Referring to the philosophical idea that each era is characterized by particular ways of thinking, the concept of Zeitgeist dates back to 18th-century philosophers and is often associated with Johann Gottfried Herder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mahlzeit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like time itself, food is elementary to the human existence. A &quot;Mahlzeit&quot; simply means &quot;meal time,&quot; and can refer to breakfast, lunch or dinner. But it's also used to wish someone else the maximum amount of pleasure while eating. Next time you see a friend chomping down on a sandwich, you can say, &quot;Mahlzeit!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hochzeit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often referred to as the happiest day of your life. In German, it's also a &quot;high time&quot; — a &quot;Hochzeit.&quot; Who isn't high on adrenaline and emotion on that day of all days, on which your credit card debt reaches an all-time high? And for some impatient mothers-in-law, it certainly may be &quot;high time&quot; for that son to finally get hitched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sauregurkenzeit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &quot;pickle time!&quot; I'll have a BLT and some chips with that pickle, please... Actually the term &quot;Sauregurkenzeit&quot; originally, in the 18th century, referred to periods when little food was available. Now, it's used during the summer when everyone's on vacation, politics comes to a standstill, the streets are empty, and things get quiet. Pickle anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &quot;Genosse&quot; means &quot;comrade&quot; and has a communist after-taste, a &quot;Zeitgenosse&quot; is anyone who lives at the same time you do: a contemporary. Just think: You are a &quot;Zeitgenosse&quot; of Angela Merkel, Heidi Klum and Cristiano Ronaldo. Your co-worker may not cheer, though, if you tell him he's your &quot;time comrade.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zeitgefühl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German often has a single word for a concept English needs a phrase to express. &quot;Zeitgefühl&quot; is your sense of time — something that suffers when you're concentrating on an important project, staring into the eyes of your sweetheart, or changing the clocks back for daylight savings. Your Zeitgefühl may say it's 8:00 am, but it's really only 7:00. So go back to sleep already!&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>The EU is set to end daylight saving time in 2021, at least in some states. The European Parliament has taken another step towards freeing members of the bloc from the mandated change, but why is it taking so long?</og:description>

<title>Democrats to push to reinstate repealed &amp;#039;net neutrality&amp;#039; rules</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress plan to unveil legislation on Wednesday to reinstate “net neutrality” rules that were repealed by the Trump administration in December 2017, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelosi told lawmakers in a letter that House Democrats, who won control of the chamber in the November 2018 elections, would work with their colleagues in the U.S. Senate to pass the “Save The Internet Act.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text of the proposed legislation has not been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission repealed the rules that bar providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid “fast lanes.” The repeal was a win for providers like Comcast Corp, AT&amp;amp;T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, but was opposed by internet companies like Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, voted in May 2018 to reinstate the net neutrality rules, but the House did not take up the issue before Congress adjourned last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. federal appeals court last month held lengthy oral arguments in a legal challenge to the FCC’s decision to repeal the net neutrality rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its 2017 decision, the Republican-led FCC voted 3-2 along party lines to reverse the net neutrality rules. The agency gave providers sweeping power to recast how users access the internet but said they must disclose changes in users’ internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for FCC chairman Ajit Pai did not immediately comment on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 22 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia asked the appeals court to reinstate the Obama-era internet rules and to block the FCC’s effort to pre-empt states from imposing their own rules guaranteeing an open internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major providers say they have not made any changes in how Americans access the internet since the repeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, California agreed not to enforce its own state net neutrality law until the appeals court’s decision on the 2017 repeal, and any potential review by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;

Its unusual properties, such as extraordinary tensile strength and electrical conductivity, have earmarked it as one of the most promising materials for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it has been difficult to produce large quantities of single-layer graphene using existing methods, such as chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Current production routes are also quite costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, said Dr Nair, &quot;graphene oxide can be produced by simple oxidation in the lab&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told BBC News: &quot;As an ink or solution, we can compose it on a substrate or porous material. Then we can use it as a membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In terms of scalability and the cost of the material, graphene oxide has a potential advantage over single-layered graphene.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the single-layer graphene he added: &quot;To make it permeable, you need to drill small holes in the membrane. But if the hole size is larger than one nanometre, the salts go through that hole. You have to make a membrane with a very uniform less-than-one-nanometre hole size to make it useful for desalination. It is a really challenging job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphene oxide membranes have already proven their worth in sieving out small nanoparticles, organic molecules and even large salts. But until now, they couldn't be used to filter out common salts, which require even smaller sieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work had shown that graphene oxide membranes became slightly swollen when immersed in water, allowing smaller salts to flow through the pores along with water molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Dr Nair and colleagues demonstrated that placing walls made of epoxy resin (a substance used in coatings and glues) on either side of the graphene oxide membrane was sufficient to stop the expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;More about graphene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/science-environment-21031991&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;What is graphene?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20975580&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Graphene patent surge reveals global race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11478645&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;How sticky tape trick led to Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19918703&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;How could graphene transform the future?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21014297&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Is graphene really a wonder material?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting the swelling in this way also allowed the scientists to tune the properties of the membrane, letting through less or more common salt for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When common salts are dissolved in water, they always form a &quot;shell&quot; of water molecules around the salt molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows the tiny capillaries of the graphene-oxide membranes to block the salt from flowing through along with the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Water molecules can go through individually, but sodium chloride cannot. It always needs the help of the water molecules. The size of the shell of water around the salt is larger than the channel size, so it cannot go through,&quot; said Dr Nair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    The scientists plan to test the graphene oxide sieve against existing industrial membranes used in desalination
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, water molecules flow exceptionally fast through the membrane barrier, which makes it ideal for use in desalination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the capillary size is around one nanometre, which is very close to the size of the water molecule, those molecules form a nice interconnected arrangement like a train,&quot; Dr Nair explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That makes the movement of water faster: if you push harder on one side, the molecules all move on the other side because of the hydrogen bonds between them. You can only get that situation if the channel size is very small.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2025 the UN expects that 14% of the world's population will encounter water scarcity. As the effects of climate change continue to reduce urban water supplies, wealthy modern countries are also investing in desalination technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current desalination plants around the world use polymer-based membranes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is our first demonstration that we can control the spacing [of pores in the membrane] and that we can do desalination, which was not possible before. The next step is to compare this with the state-of-the-art material available on the market,&quot; said Dr Nair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a news and views article accompanying the study in Nature Nanotechnology, Ram Devanathan, from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, US, said more work needed to be done to produce graphene oxide membranes inexpensively at industrial scales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that scientists also needed to demonstrate the durability of the membranes under prolonged contact with seawater and ensure the membrane was resistant to &quot;fouling&quot; by salts and biological material (which requires existing barriers to be periodically cleaned or replaced).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The selective separation of water molecules from ions by physical restriction of interlayer spacing opens the door to the synthesis of inexpensive membranes for desalination,&quot; wrote Dr Devanathan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ultimate goal is to create a filtration device that will produce potable water from seawater or wastewater with minimal energy input.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Paul &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rincon_p&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;on Twitter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chunkwm – a tiling window manager for macOS</title>
<link>https://koekeishiya.github.io/chunkwm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://koekeishiya.github.io/chunkwm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chunkwm&lt;/strong&gt; is a tiling window manager for macOS that uses a plugin architecture, successor to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kwm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It represents windows as the leaves of a binary tree, and supports binary space partitioned, monocle and floating desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development is happening on macOS Mojave (10.14), but OSX El Capitan (10.11.6) and newer should work fine. Older versions may or may not be compatible and will not be officially supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chunkwm&lt;/strong&gt; runs a local daemon to receive messages on a dedicated socket (port 3920).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chunkc&lt;/strong&gt; is a program that writes messages on &lt;em&gt;chunkwm's&lt;/em&gt; socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chunkwm&lt;/strong&gt; does not handle any keyboard input.&lt;br/&gt;A third party program (e.g: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;skhd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is needed to map keyboard events to &lt;em&gt;chunkwm&lt;/em&gt; actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of my tiling window managers (&lt;em&gt;kwm&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;chunkwm&lt;/em&gt;) have been heavily inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm&quot;&gt;bspwm&lt;/a&gt;, and I'd like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/baskerville&quot;&gt;baskerville&lt;/a&gt; for his project and for introducing me to an interesting tiling concept.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Achieving 100k connections per second with Elixir</title>
<link>https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Both HTTP 1.x and HTTP/2 rely on lower level connection-oriented protocols, namely TCP/IP and TLS. These protocols provide reliable delivery and correct order when data is chunked into multiple packets. TLS also includes encryption and authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTTP client needs to open a connection before it can send a request. For efficiency, each connection is likely to be reused for sending subsequent requests. To ensure this is the case while using HTTP 1.0, the client can set the &lt;code&gt;connection: keep-alive&lt;/code&gt; header, while HTTP 1.1 and HTTP/2 keep connections alive by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web browsers maintain “warm” connections for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2011/06/28/http-keep-alive-connection-timeouts/&quot;&gt;a few minutes&lt;/a&gt;, and server-to-server connections are usually kept alive much longer. The WebSocket protocol (built on top of HTTP) only allows for explicit closure of underlying HTTP connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means, performance-wise, is that measuring requests per second gets a lot more attention than connections per second. Usually, the latter can be one or two orders of magnitude lower than the former. Correspondingly, benchmarks use long-living connections to simulate multiple requests from the same device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are scenarios where this assumption does not hold true. For example, low-power IoT devices cannot afford to maintain active connections. A sensor could “wake up”, then establish a connection to a server, send a payload request, receive an acknowledgment response, close the connection, and go back to “sleep”. With such a workload, the connection-per-second and request-per-second rates would be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we look at scaling Elixir to handle 100k connections per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload consists of 100k devices, each simply opening a TCP/IP connection, waiting for 1±10% seconds, and closing the connection. The test consists of three phases: a 15-minute rampup, 1 minute sustained load, and 15-minute rampdown. The following &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/stressgrid&quot;&gt;Stressgrid&lt;/a&gt; script represents the workload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;delay(1000, 0.1)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested against &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/1.7/manual/&quot;&gt;Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, which is the socket acceptor pool at the heart of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.6/manual/&quot;&gt;Cowboy&lt;/a&gt; web server. With Ranch, it is possible to implement a server for any TCP/IP- and TSL-based protocol, which makes our benchmark not specific to HTTP. We used Ubuntu 18.04 with the 4.15.0-1031-aws kernel, with sysctld overrides seen in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/blob/b0f95dcd152eeeba4461f71ba784a21c9b3c5dcc/etc/sysctl.d/10-dummy.conf&quot;&gt;/etc/sysctl.d/10-dummy.conf&lt;/a&gt;. We used Erlang 21.2.6-1 on a 36-core c5.9xlarge instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run this test, we used Stressgrid with twenty c5.xlarge generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ranch-1-7&quot;&gt;Ranch 1.7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first test, we used unmodified Ranch 1.7. The connection rate graph shows a clear breaking point at 70k connections per second. After this point, connection latency grows, causing the rate to peak at 82k connections per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/1_7_rate.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/1_7_rate.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good way of oberving the bottleneck effect is the 90th percentile latency. At 14th minute mark, the latency jumps from single-digit milliseconds to 1 second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/1_7_lat90.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/1_7_lat90.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this bottleneck, we need to take a quick dive into the architecture of Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranch maintains a pool of acceptors to enable more throughput when handling new connections. By default, Ranch starts with 10 acceptors. In this test, we set it to 36—the number of CPU cores on our c5.9xlarge. We also performed the same test with acceptors set to 4x and 16x number of CPU cores, with negligible differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior makes it possible for our server to accept new connections with a high degree of parallelism. When a socket is accepted, it is passed to to a newly-started connection process. However, all connection processes are started by a single connection supervisor. This supervisor becomes our primary suspect in our search for the bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, we modified our test server &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/blob/7e8aaddfd545d1ce735175a67b998d0a130b246a/elixir_dummy/lib/elixir_dummy/reporter.ex&quot;&gt;to report&lt;/a&gt; the supervisor’s message queue length. Indeed, we observed between 20 and 200 messages in the 90th percentile, starting at 9th minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/1_7_sup_queue.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/1_7_sup_queue.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Ranch maintainers are well aware of this problem. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ninenines/ranch/pull/198/files&quot;&gt;a pull request with a proof of concept&lt;/a&gt; that introduces acceptor-supervisor pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;multi-supervisor-ranch&quot;&gt;Multi-supervisor Ranch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With acceptor-supervisor pairs, there should no longer be any points of contention in the path of creating new connections within Ranch. To verify this, we collected a similar report for the total message queue length for all 36 connection supervisors. The 90th percentile now stays below 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/sup_queue.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/sup_queue.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it too early to celebrate—at 15th minute mark, 90th percentile latency jumps to 1 second again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/mulsup_lat90.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/mulsup_lat90.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breaking point in the connection rate graph is less pronounced, but remains at about 70k connections per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hit another bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/mulsup_rate.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/mulsup_rate.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this bottleneck, we need to understand how TCP/IP is implemented inside the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the client wants to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment&quot;&gt;establish a new connection&lt;/a&gt;, it sends a SYN packet. When the server receives SYN, it places the new connection in SYN queue and reports it as being in a &lt;code&gt;syn-recv&lt;/code&gt; state. The connection stays in &lt;code&gt;syn-recv&lt;/code&gt; state until it is moved to the accept queue. When the userland program—in our case Ranch—invokes the &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; function, it removes the connection from the accept queue, and the connection becomes established. Cloudflare has &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/syn-packet-handling-in-the-wild/&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; with a detailed explanation of this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/blob/b0f95dcd152eeeba4461f71ba784a21c9b3c5dcc/etc/syn_stats.sh&quot;&gt;a bash script&lt;/a&gt; that records the number of connections in &lt;code&gt;syn-recv&lt;/code&gt; state during our test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 11th minute, the number of connections quickly reaches 1k. With the maximum SYN queue length set to 1024 with the &lt;code&gt;net.core.somaxconn&lt;/code&gt; sysctl parameter, overflowing SYN packets get dropped. The clients back off and re-send SYN packets later. This results in the 90th percentile latency we saw earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/mulsup_syn_queue.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/mulsup_syn_queue.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modified Ranch is able to accept with higher degree of parallelism, but the &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; function gets invoked on a single shared listener socket. It turns out, the Linux kernel experiences contention when it comes to invoking &lt;code&gt;accept()&lt;/code&gt; on the same listener socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a group of engineers from Google discussed the issues with lock contention and suboptimal load balancing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://domsch.com/linux/lpc2010/Scaling_techniques_for_servers_with_high_connection%20rates.pdf&quot;&gt;a presentation&lt;/a&gt;, where they also estimate the maximum connections per second rate to be around 50k (on 2010 hardware). Furthermore, they proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/&quot;&gt;a Linux kernel patch&lt;/a&gt; that introduced the &lt;code&gt;SO_REUSEPORT&lt;/code&gt; socket option, that makes it possible to open many listener sockets &lt;em&gt;on the same port&lt;/em&gt;, causing the sockets to be load-balanced when accepting new connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;multi-supervisor-ranch-with-so-reuseport&quot;&gt;Multi-supervisor Ranch with &lt;code&gt;SO_REUSEPORT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out if the &lt;code&gt;SO_REUSEPORT&lt;/code&gt; socket option would help, we created &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/stressgrid/dummies/blob/ae3be721e7a73fb22d26b3c15107e15ae5c3e798/elixir_dummy/lib/elixir_dummy/application.ex&quot;&gt;a proof of concept application&lt;/a&gt; in which we ran multiple Ranch listeners on the same port with &lt;code&gt;SO_REUSEPORT&lt;/code&gt; set using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html#setopts-2&quot;&gt;raw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;setops&lt;/code&gt; option. We set the number of listeners to be the same as the number of available CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this proof of concept, we again measured the number of connections in &lt;code&gt;syn-recv&lt;/code&gt; state during our test. This number never gets close to 1k, meaning we’re no longer dropping SYN messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/syn_queue.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/syn_queue.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90th percentile latency confirms our findings: it remains consistently low throughout the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/reuseport_lat90.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/reuseport_lat90.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When zooming in, 90th percentile latency measures between 1 and 2 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/reuseport_only_lat90.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/reuseport_only_lat90.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also observed much better CPU utilization, which resulted from less contention and fairer load balancing when accepting new connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/cpu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/cpu.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the connections per second rate reaches 99k, with network latency and available CPU resources contributing to the next bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/reuseport_rate.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stressgrid.com/blog/100k_cps_with_elixir/reuseport_rate.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing the initial test results, proposing a theory, and confirming it by measuring against modified software, we were able to find two bottlenecks on the way to getting to 100k connections per second with Elixir and Ranch. The combination of multiple connection supervisors in Ranch and multiple listener sockets in the Linux kernel is necessary to achieve full utilization of the 36-core machine under the target workload.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Along the way, the games have introduced millions of players to the joys and frustrations of zoning, street grids and infrastructure funding — and influenced a generation of people who plan cities for a living. For many urban and transit planners, architects, government officials and activists, “SimCity” was their first taste of running a city. It was the first time they realized that neighborhoods, towns and cities were things that were planned, and that it was someone's job to decide where streets, schools, bus stops and stores were supposed to go.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; Rust is a major advancement in industrial programming languages due in large part to its success in bridging the gap between low-level systems programming and high-level application programming. This success has ultimately empowered programmers to more easily build reliable and efficient software, and at its heart lies a novel approach to ownership that balances type system expressivity with usability.&lt;br/&gt;In this work, we set out to capture the essence of this model of ownership by developing a type systems account of Rust's borrow checker. To that end, we present Oxide, a formalized programming language close to source-level Rust (but with fully-annotated types). This presentation takes a new view of lifetimes as approximate provenances of references, and our type system is able to automatically compute this information through a flow-sensitive substructural typing judgment for which we prove syntactic type safety using progress and preservation. The result is a simpler formulation of borrow checking - including recent features such as non-lexical lifetimes - that we hope researchers will be able to use as the basis for work on Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

The result is a simpler formulation of borrow checking - including recent features such as non-lexical lifetimes - that we hope researchers will be able to use as the basis for work on Rust.</og:description>
