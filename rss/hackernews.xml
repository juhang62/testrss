<title>Slack closes account of an Iranian user living in Canada</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m in Canada
No ties to Iran
No teammates in Iran!

If using slack is against US sanctions, the same applies to google, twitter, facebook...

Basically, we should ethnically profile people and stop giving services to certain ethnicities.

Tomorrow, Iranians can’t ride the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Hi everybody,

Thanks to all of the extremely useful feedback we've received during
the TestFlight of WireGuard for iOS, Roopesh, Eric, and I have now
released a beta into the App Store itself:

&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&lt;/a&gt;
Depending on your region and Apple's caching semantics, this link
might take some unknown amount of time to begin working.

Apple requested a video of the app running on a physical device during
their review of the app, showing that it works. For the curiosity of
non-iPhone folks, you can see it here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.zx2c4.com/wireguard-ios-app-store-review.mp4&quot;&gt;https://data.zx2c4.com/wireguard-ios-app-store-review.mp4&lt;/a&gt; . It's more
or less the same interface as on Android and is designed to be as
simple and &quot;system-like&quot; as possible, while still exposing all of the
features and flexibility of WireGuard.

Please do keep the feedback coming. At the moment, I'm especially
interested in reports of people transitioning between mobile and WiFi
when using T-Mobile's network within the US. But generally, all bug
reports, complete with the exported log, are very welcome, as we
continue to refine these beta releases.

As before, if you're interested in doing development on this app,
please get in touch with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.zx2c4.com/mailman/listinfo/wireguard&quot;&gt;team at wireguard.com.&lt;/a&gt; Likewise, we're always
looking for a helping hand with a variety of tasks, including but not
limited to:
- iOS
- macOS
- Android
- Windows
- Web development (wireguard.com could use some love)
- Various kernels
- So forth

Enjoy,
Jason

&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; Hey folks,
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; For the last few weeks, Roopesh and I have been hard at work on the
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; WireGuard for iOS app. Today we're happy to share a
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; likely-buggy-and-broken TestFlight that you can run on your phone:
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://testflight.apple.com/join/63I19SDT&quot;&gt;https://testflight.apple.com/join/63I19SDT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;. As usual, use at your
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; own risk, especially since it's alpha quality.
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; Please let us know about any bugs as you find them -- you can send
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; them to me or to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.zx2c4.com/mailman/listinfo/wireguard&quot;&gt;team at wireguard.com.&lt;/a&gt; Our current TODO list lives here
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; [1], linked via the main project TODO list [2], and if you're an iOS
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; person and want to contribute code, we'd be happy to have you on
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; board.
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; The app costs $3.99 and requires an email address to sign up; we
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; manage all your tunnels for you in the cloud. JUST KIDDING! Like the
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; rest of WireGuard, the iOS app is free and open source [3]. I make
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; this rather tasteless joke, because of the rather surprising
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; quantities of people encouraging me to do the iOS stuff as proprietary
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; paid software, because &quot;apple users will pay&quot; or because &quot;open source
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; is cool, but iphone folks don't care about it so you can get away with
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; charging&quot; or because &quot;none of the other vpn players are doing open
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; source mobile implementations&quot; or even because &quot;apple is more likely
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; to accept paid software into its app store&quot; and so on and so forth.
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; But, as usual, I much prefer for this to be a community project than a
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; closed one, and so like everything else, it's FLOSS.
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; Enjoy! And do let us know about the bugs as you run into them. I'm
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; sure there are plenty.
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; Regards,

<title>For First Time in More Than 20 Years, Copyrighted Works Will Enter Public Domain</title>
<link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/?preview</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/?preview</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;“Whose woods these are, I think I”—whoa! We can’t quote any more of Robert Frost’s “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” because it is still under copyright as this magazine goes to press. But come January 1, 2019, we, you, and everyone in America will be able to quote it at length on any platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At midnight on New Year’s Eve, all works first published in the United States in 1923 will enter the public domain. It has been 21 years since the last mass expiration of copyright in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That deluge of works includes not just “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” which appeared first in the &lt;em&gt;New Republic&lt;/em&gt; in 1923, but hundreds of thousands of books, musical compositions, paintings, poems, photographs and films. After January 1, any record label can issue a dubstep version of the 1923 hit “Yes! We Have No Bananas,” any middle school can produce Theodore Pratt’s stage adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em&gt;, and any historian can publish Winston Churchill’s &lt;em&gt;The World Crisis&lt;/em&gt; with her own extensive annotations. Any artist can create and sell a feminist response to Marcel Duchamp’s seminal Dadaist piece, &lt;em&gt;The Large Glass (The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even)&lt;/em&gt; and any filmmaker can remake Cecil B. DeMille’s original &lt;em&gt;The Ten Commandments&lt;/em&gt; and post it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The public domain has been frozen in time for 20 years, and we’re reaching the 20-year thaw,” says Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke Law School’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain. The release is unprecedented, and its impact on culture and creativity could be huge. We have never seen such a mass entry into the public domain in the digital age. The last one—in 1998, when 1922 slipped its copyright bond—predated Google. “We have shortchanged a generation,” said Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive. “The 20th century is largely missing from the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For academics fearful of quoting from copyrighted texts, teachers who may be violating the law with every photocopy, and modern-day artists in search of inspiration, the event is a cause for celebration. For those who dread seeing Frost’s immortal ode to winter used in an ad for snow tires, “Public Domain Day,” as it is sometimes known, will be less joyful. Despite that, even fierce advocates for copyright agree that, after 95 years, it is time to release these works. “There comes a point when a creative work belongs to history as much as to its author and her heirs,” said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of the Authors Guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can blame Mickey Mouse for the long wait. In 1998, Disney was one of the loudest in a choir of corporate voices advocating for longer copyright protections. At the time, all works published before January 1, 1978, were entitled to copyright protection for 75 years; all author’s works published on or after that date were under copyright for the lifetime of the creator, plus 50 years. &lt;em&gt;Steamboat Willie&lt;/em&gt;, featuring Mickey Mouse’s first appearance on screen, in 1928, was set to enter the public domain in 2004. At the urging of Disney and others, Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, named for the late singer, songwriter and California representative, adding 20 years to the copyright term. Mickey would be protected until 2024—and no copyrighted work would enter the public domain again until 2019, creating a bizarre 20-year hiatus between the release of works from 1922 and those from 1923.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hole in history was accidental, but it occurred at a remarkable moment. The novelist Willa Cather called 1922 the year “the world broke in two,” the start of a great literary, artistic and cultural upheaval. In 1922, &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; by James Joyce and T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land” were published, and the Harlem Renaissance blossomed with the arrival of Claude McKay’s poetry in &lt;em&gt;Harlem Shadows&lt;/em&gt;. For two decades those works have been in the public domain, enabling artists, critics and others to burnish that notable year to a high gloss in our historical memory. In comparison, 1923 can feel dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was the year Noël Coward staged his first musical, the hit &lt;em&gt;London Calling!&lt;/em&gt;, and Jean Toomer came out with his breakthrough novel about African-American life, &lt;em&gt;Cane&lt;/em&gt;. Because access to these and other works from the year has been limited, our understanding of the tumultuous 1920s is skewed. That will begin to change January 1, when digital compendia such as the Internet Archive, Google Books and HathiTrust will make tens of thousands of books available, with more to follow. They and others will also add heaps of newspapers, magazines, movies and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much the same will happen every January 1 until 2073, revealing long-overlooked works from the Harlem Renaissance, the Great Depression, World War II and beyond. (After 2073, works published by authors who died seven decades earlier will expire each year.) “We’re going to open these time capsules on a yearly basis...and potentially have our understanding of that year and all the contents change,” said Paul Saint-Amour, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania and editor of &lt;em&gt;Modernism and Copyright&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t predict what uses people are going to make of the work we make available,” said Mike Furlough, executive director of HathiTrust. “And that’s what makes that so exciting,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference.” How refreshing it is to quote freely from another iconic Robert Frost poem, “The Road Not Taken,” published in his poetry collection &lt;em&gt;Mountain Interval&lt;/em&gt; in 1916. Its copyright expired in 1992 and that &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; made all the difference. The poem has inspired lyrics from Bruce Hornsby, Melissa Etheridge and George Strait, and its phrases have been used to sell cars, careers, computers and countless dorm room posters that feature the final lines as an exhortation to individualism that the poet likely never intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 1, HathiTrust will publish Frost’s collection &lt;em&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/em&gt;, including “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” online and it will finally be available for anyone to adapt. Perhaps no one is more bemused by that prospect than the composer Eric Whitacre. In 1999, believing the poem had already entered the public domain (the last-minute copyright extension prevented that), Whitacre accepted a commission to turn it into a choral piece. After just two performances, Whitacre said, Frost’s publisher and the Frost estate shut him down, refusing to license the work. Whitacre eventually produced a different version of the work, titled “Sleep,” with lyrics written for it by the poet Charles Anthony Silvestri. He is now considering releasing the work in its original form. “All I wanted to do,” Whitacre said, “is illuminate the original poem with music.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When that year's copyright skedaddles, you'll have instant access to countless titles, including these overlooked gems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“The Vanishing American” in &lt;em&gt;Ladies’ Home Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Zane Grey&lt;br/&gt;One of the first literary critiques of the treatment of Native Americans; harsher than the later novel and silent film.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook, the online social network, has more than 2 billion global users. Because those users do not pay for the service, its benefits are hard to measure. We report the results of a series of three non-hypothetical auction experiments where winners are paid to deactivate their Facebook accounts for up to one year. Though the populations sampled and the auction design differ across the experiments, we consistently find the average Facebook user would require more than $1000 to deactivate their account for one year. While the measurable impact Facebook and other free online services have on the economy may be small, our results show that the benefits these services provide for their users are large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Facebook broadcasted its first-ever television advertisement, entitled “The Things That Connect Us” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] The ad compared Facebook, in its utility and meaning, to a chair; an object that not only has functional value to individuals, but can also be at the heart of building and maintaining social relationships. The popularity of the network is in itself evidence that users value the service. If Facebook were a country, it would be the world’s largest in terms of population with over 2.20 billion monthly active users, 1.45 billion of whom are active on a daily basis [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], spending an average of 50 minutes each day on Facebook-owned platforms (e.g., Facebook, Messenger, Instagram) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref003&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]. This means that, collectively, its users spend more than 100,000 years on Facebook each day. Despite concerns about loss of relevance due to declining personal posts by users [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;], diminished interest in adoption and use by teens and young adults [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;], claims about potential manipulation of its content for political purposes [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref006&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;], and leaks that question the company’s handling of private user data [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;], Facebook remains the top social networking site in the world and the third most visited site on the Internet after Google and YouTube [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in 2004, Facebook has redefined how we communicate, maintain relationships, get information, manage public impressions of ourselves in a digital environment, and consume entertainment [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref009&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]. But compared to its cultural impact, Facebook’s macroeconomic impact is small. Facebook had 23,165 employees as of September 30, 2017 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. This is less than 1% the number employed by Walmart, the world’s largest private employer, and less than a third the number employed by Rite Aid, America’s 100th largest private employer [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref014&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;]. Because Facebook’s users pay nothing for the service, Facebook does not contribute directly to gross domestic product (GDP), economists’ standard metric of a nation’s output [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;]. In this context, it may seem surprising then that Facebook is the world’s fifth most valuable company [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref016&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;] with a market capitalization of $541.56 billion in May 2018 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref017&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;], notwithstanding the dip in market capitalization following the most recent reputation crisis fueled by emerging news about Facebook’s role in the recent U.S. presidential elections [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]. In 2017, the company had $40.65 billion in revenues, primarily from advertising, and $20.20 billion in net income [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref019&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;] while still offering the social networking service to its 2.20 billion users, at face value, for free. However, just because something is costless to a user does not imply that it has no value to that user. The question we pose here is just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; valuable is Facebook to its users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question may shed light on the Solow Paradox, named for Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate economist who in 1987 observed, “What everyone feels to have been a technological revolution, a drastic change in our productive lives, has been accompanied everywhere … by a slowing-down of productivity growth, not a step up. You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics” [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;]. More concretely, the amount the average American worker produces grew by an average 2.8% per year in the post-war era through the 1960s, but grew by an average of 1.9% per year from 1970 to 2017 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref021&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;]. While a difference of less than a percentage point may seem inconsequential, through the power of compounding it means the average worker’s output doubles every 37 years rather than every 25 years. But what if these output measures severely underestimate the benefits information communication technologies like Facebook create for society more broadly? While it is generally the case that &lt;em&gt;price&lt;/em&gt; is an underestimate of &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; to users, the distinction becomes even more marked when we try to consider the social value of services that are offered at no price to their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we use experimental auctions to directly estimate the value U.S. users place on Facebook. Auction winners were paid to deactivate their account for as little as one hour or as long as one year. Because auction participants faced real financial consequences, they had an incentive to seriously consider what they would need to be compensated to go without the service for the time period specified. Though auction procedures and subject demographics varied across our four samples and different procedures, we consistently find that our 1,258 auction participants derive over $1000 of value annually on average from Facebook, reinforcing the idea that the computer age’s effect on society’s well-being is much larger than its effect on GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure the value of a product or service to consumers, economists would generally estimate &lt;em&gt;consumer surplus&lt;/em&gt;. This is a measure of value equal to the difference between the most a consumer would be willing to pay for a service and the price she actually pays to use it. When considering all consumers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone-0207101-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1&lt;/a&gt; shows consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve, which shows consumers’ willingness to pay, and above the price; it is generally interpreted as consumers’ net benefit from being able to access a good or service in the marketplace [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref022&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;]. GDP, by contrast, is the market value of all final goods and services produced domestically in a given year, and a market capitalization is often interpreted as the marketplace’s estimate of investors’ expectations of a company’s future flow of profits, discounted to the current time [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref023&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Free or low-cost online services may generate consumer surplus orders of magnitude greater than their measurable impact on GDP. Bapna, Jank, and Shmueli [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref024&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;] found that eBay users received a median of $4 in consumer surplus per transaction in 2003, or $7 billion in total. Ghose, Smith, and Telang [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;] found that Amazon’s used-book market generated $67 million in annual consumer surplus. Brynjolfsson, Hu, and Smith [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref026&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;] found that the increased variety of books available on Amazon created $1 billion in consumer surplus in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widening the lens to focus on the entire Internet, Greenstein and McDevitt [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref027&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;] found that high-speed Internet access (as opposed to dial-up) generated $4.8 billion to $6.7 billion of consumer surplus in total between 1999 and 2006. Dutz, Orszag, and Willig [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;] estimated that high-speed internet access generated $32 billion in consumer surplus in 2008 alone. Both studies used variations in the price households pay for high-speed internet to estimate demand and, by extension, consumer surplus. Goolsbee and Klenow [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref029&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;] instead used the value of internet users’ time (i.e., their wages) to estimate the value derived from time spent online. The authors found that American households derived $2500 to $3800 in consumer surplus from the internet in 2004. According to the Pew Research Center [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref030&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;], 54% of American adults had home internet access in 2004. Applying this percentage to America’s 112 million households in 2004 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;], Goolsbee and Klenow’s results suggest that Americans received $150 billion to $230 billion in consumer surplus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Methods and results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study began as two separate teams that independently designed experimental auctions to estimate the economic value of Facebook. As a result, each auction has a slightly different design and advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our experimental auctions use a Vickrey [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref032&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;] second-price approach. In a typical experimental auction [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref033&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;], participants bid to purchase a good or service. The highest bidder wins the auction and pays a price equal to the second-highest bid. This approach is designed such that participants’ best strategy is to bid their true willingness-to-pay, rather than underbid or overbid for strategic purposes [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref032&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref034&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;]. Each bid can therefore be interpreted as the maximum a participant would be willing to pay for a product, which in turn provides a means of estimating demand. Note that these are real auctions where winners actually purchase the product, in contrast to hypothetical experiments or surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our study participants already had free access to Facebook, we could not ask people how much they would be willing to pay for access to the service. Instead, people bid for how much they would need in compensation to give up using Facebook. Economists have used these “willingness-to-accept” auctions to assess the value of mundane items such as pens and chocolate bars, but also more abstract or novel items such as food safety [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref035&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;], goods free of genetically modified ingredients [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref036&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;], the stigma associated with HIV [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref037&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;], battery life in smartphones [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref038&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;], and the payment people require to endure an unpleasant experience like tasting a bitter fluid [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref039&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;] or listening to an annoying noise [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref040&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;]. Unlike the vast majority of these applications, however, our approach is measuring the value of a product with which all participants are familiar and endowed prior to starting our study, minimizing concerns that the values we are measuring are ones that were first induced in the experimental setting rather than “homegrown” ones brought to the table by our subjects (e.g., [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref041&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, each bid can be interpreted as the minimum dollar amount a person would be willing to accept in exchange for not using Facebook for a given time period. The three auctions described below differ in the amount of time winners would have to go without using Facebook and, framing, and, importantly, sample selection. Across the three auctions, we use two samples of college students, a non-student community sample, and an online sample recruited using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. While none of these samples is truly representative of Facebook’s users, paying participants to deactivate their accounts means we face a tradeoff between cost and representativeness that would not be present in a purely hypothetical survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;section1&quot; class=&quot;section toc-section&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Auction 1 methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred twenty-two Facebook users on the campus of a Midwestern liberal arts college took part in Study 1, in groups of 10 to 12 participants at a time. Each received $20 for participating. Participants (Mean Age = 20.9, SD = 6.0; 64.2% Females) were given oral and written instructions on the auction mechanism, and then participated in a practice auction. For the practice auction, each participant received a pocket calculator and a pen, and submitted separate bids to sell each item in a second-price auction. After a monitor collected these bids, a volunteer rolled a die to determine which of the items would be sold. The lowest bidder for the selected item sold it to the monitor at a price equal to the second-lowest bid submitted. The purpose of this practice auction was to familiarize participants with the auction framework by showing them that they would place several bids but only one auction would be carried out, and that the low bidder in that binding auction would be paid the second-lowest bid for giving up something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the practice auction, participants bid in an auction to be paid to give up Facebook for one hour, one day, three days, and one week, with the understanding that one timeframe would be randomly chosen after all bids were collected, and that the selected timeframe would be binding on the low bidder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this auction, payment was tied to proof of deactivation. Participants understood that to receive the money for giving up Facebook, they would have to show the experimenter a page from their Facebook settings showing when they had deactivated and reactivated their account. Once this happened, the lowest bidder in each group was paid a price equal to the second-lowest bid offered in that group. This work was subject to human subjects review and approved by the Social Science/Behavioral/Education IRB at Michigan State University and the Institutional Review Board at Kenyon College, and written or online informed consent was obtained from all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Auction 1 results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants’ mean WTA for deactivating their Facebook account for one hour was $1.84 (&lt;em&gt;SD =&lt;/em&gt; $3.41) with a median of $1.00. Mean WTA for deactivating for one day was $6.01 (&lt;em&gt;SD =&lt;/em&gt; $12.21) with a median of $3.00. Mean WTA for deactivating for three days was $15.73 (&lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; = $34.51) with a median of $6.00. Mean WTA for deactivating for seven days was $38.83 (&lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; = $140.56) with a median of $15.00. Subtracting WTA for a one-hour deactivation from WTA for longer timeframes allows us to estimate net WTA, or willingness to accept after subtracting for the minor hassle of going through the process of deactivating and verifying deactivation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone-0207101-t001&quot;&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt; presents summary statistics for WTA and net WTA, as well as estimated annual WTA based on linear extrapolations of net WTA. Ten of the eleven winners from the eleven auction sessions provided proof of deactivation and collected their payment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using random-effects regression analysis (not shown here), we find no evidence that gender, age, income, or the number of other social networking sites participants use affected WTA for Facebook. However, we find a statistically significant positive relationship between WTA and how frequently a participant posts status updates (p = 0.02) or uses Facebook to invite people to events (p = 0.02). Those who posted photos more often placed a lower value on Facebook (p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Auction 1 discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on mean values, we find that net WTA for a three-day deactivation is more than three times net WTA for one day. Likewise, net WTA for a seven-day deactivation is more than seven times net WTA for one day. This suggests that, on average, the daily welfare lost from not having to access increases as the deactivation period increases. This is not true for median values for net WTA. In addition to being smaller in magnitude, median net WTA per day does not rise with the deactivation period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the demographic homogeneity of our convenience sample of Facebook users, it is not surprising that our demographic variables are not statistically significant predictors of WTA. What is more surprising is that users who post photos more often place lower value on Facebook. There are, however, many other options for online photo sharing, most notably Instagram. It is possible that those who use Facebook primarily to share photos might be among the least invested in the specific form of online social networking offered by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;section4&quot; class=&quot;section toc-section&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Auction 2 methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the second auction bid for how much they would need to close their Facebook account for an entire year. Participants were trained in the second-price auction through a tutorial and then a simulated auction in which participants were required to bid on how much they would need to be paid to sell the shoes they were wearing at the time of the study. Participants then took part in an actual second-price auction to close their Facebook accounts; they were warned that this was not hypothetical and that the experimenters would watch them deactivate their accounts before paying the second-lowest bid amount to the winner, and could then check their Facebook account throughout the year to ensure compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two pre-tests (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 38) to ensure that the auction procedures were clear to participants, Auction 2 was replicated with two samples: a group consisting of 133 college students from a large Midwestern university (Mean Age = 20.44; SD Age = 1.20; 75.2% Female; 71.4% White/Caucasian) and another sample of 138 adults recruited via an online community subject pool at a large Midwestern college town (Mean Age = 23.67, SD Age = 8.28; 56.5% Female; 61.7% White/Caucasian). In addition to the amount received by auction winners, all student participants were compensated through credit in a student subject pool that could be used for participation points in cooperating classes, and all community pool participants received $10 for their participation in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Auction 2 results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-one participants in the student sample declined to bid (bid “No”), and two participants bid more than $50,000, which for purposes of this analysis was considered to be a likely protest bid and outside of the population of interest. Removing these 43 responses leaves 90 responses for analysis. The average bid for deactivating Facebook for one year in the student sample was $2,076 (&lt;em&gt;SD =&lt;/em&gt; $8,041), and the median bid was $200. Twenty-one participants in the community sample declined to bid, and two participants bid more than $50,000. Removing these 23 responses leaves 115 responses for analysis. In the community sample, the average bid was $1,139 (&lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; = $3,756), and the median bid was $100. A total of 21 winners received cash payment for their winning bids (4 additional participants won yet received $0), and prior to receiving payment were observed to deactivate their Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Auction 2 discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this auction differs from Auction 1 in terms of the timeframe of the deactivation, the verification requirement for payment, and the representativeness of the samples, all three mean annualized net WTA estimates from Auction 1 fall between the mean WTA estimates from Auction 2. This gives us greater confidence in our WTA estimates. There is a larger gap between median WTA estimates from Auctions 1 and 2. This is partly explained by the responses removed for analysis of our Auction 2 bids. Assuming participants who refused to bid and who submitted bids greater than $50,000 were from the top half of the value distribution, the median WTA bid from the student and community samples would be $600 and $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Auction 3 methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third sample was recruited online through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an “open online marketplace for getting work done by others,” where workers complete Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref040&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;]. We posted a HIT, limited to residents of the United States, between February 2 and 12, 2015. Upon signing up for the study, participants were directed to the online questionnaire hosted on Qualtrics. Upon completion of the study, the 931 participants (Mean Age = 33.41; SD Age = 11.1; 53.1% Female) were credited 76 cents in exchange for their participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the MTurk group, the in-person procedures described in Auction 2 were mimicked, but modified to fit online administration. There was still a tutorial on methods, but it was made to be a question-and-answer teaching session built to the online format. MTurk participants were grouped by the day, with the lowest bidder on a given day being paid the second-lowest bid in exchange for deactivating their account. There were 11 winners paid to deactivate their accounts (one for each day). Given that the study was conducted online, we did not collect the Facebook profile names for the winners and cannot confirm how many of these eleven deactivated their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential for the online sample to have less engagement with the auction task than the in-person participants in the other samples, the quality of responses to the training questions and the similar distribution of results provide some reassurance that these participants understood the exercise and were taking it seriously [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref042&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;]. Assuming participants who refused to bid and who submitted bids greater than $50,000 were from the top half of the value distribution, the median WTA bid would be $200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone-0207101-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2&lt;/a&gt; shows that the annual extrapolation for the one-week bid mirrors the findings from Auction 2 (Student sample; $2,076) and Auction 3 (MTurk sample; $1,921). The bid amount for the community sample in Auction 2 was relatively low. This could be a function of multiple factors. The community sample was considerably different in terms of socioeconomic make-up from the two homogenous student samples, yet not as representative as the MTurk sample. Nonetheless, across all three samples, the mean bid to deactivate Facebook for a year exceeded $1,000. Even the most conservative of these mean WTA estimates, if applied to Facebook’s 214 million U.S. users, suggests an annual value of over $240 billion to users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As noted previously, Facebook reached a market capitalization of $542 billion in May 2018 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref017&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;]. At 2.20 billion active users in March 2018 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], this suggests a value to investors of almost $250 per user, which is less than one fourth of the annual value of Facebook access from any of our samples. This reinforces the idea that the vast majority of benefits of new inventions go not to the inventors but to the users [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref043&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;]. Further, our results provide evidence that online services can provide tremendous value to society even if their contribution to GDP is minimal. If the billions of people who use Facebook and other free online services derive anything close to $1000 per year in benefits, the productivity slowdown cited by Solow and others may not be reflected in a slowdown in the growth rate of welfare measures like consumer surplus. Many observers have commented on the difficulties of measuring productivity growth in great technological change [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref044&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;]. While our current study does not offer a solution that can be broadly applied to address this challenge, it does present a methodology and results that provide important insight into the scale of the issue when considering the online revolution of our current era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about data privacy, such as Cambridge Analytica’s alleged problematic handling of users’ private information, which are thought to have been used to influence the 2016 United States presidential election, only underscore the value Facebook’s users must derive from the service. Despite the parade of negative publicity surrounding the Cambridge Analytica revelations in mid-March 2018, Facebook added 70 million users between the end of 2017 and March 31, 2018 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207101#pone.0207101.ref045&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;]. This implies the value users derive from the social network more than offsets the privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How much is social media worth? Estimating the value of Facebook by paying users to stop using it</og:title>
<og:description>Facebook, the online social network, has more than 2 billion global users. Because those users do not pay for the service, its benefits are hard to measure. We report the results of a series of three non-hypothetical auction experiments where winners are paid to deactivate their Facebook accounts for up to one year. Though the populations sampled and the auction design differ across the experiments, we consistently find the average Facebook user would require more than $1000 to deactivate their account for one year. While the measurable impact Facebook and other free online services have on the economy may be small, our results show that the benefits these services provide for their users are large.</og:description>

Project Mu contributes numerous UEFI features targeted at modern Windows based PCs. It also demonstrates a code structure and development process for efficiently building scalable and serviceable firmware. These enhancements allow Project Mu devices to support Firmware as a Service (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW113089089&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;SpellingError SCXW113089089&quot;&gt;FaaS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;TextRun SCXW113089089&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;NormalTextRun SCXW113089089&quot;&gt;). Similar to Windows as a Service, Firmware as a Service optimizes UEFI and other system firmware for timely quality patches that keep firmware up to date and enables efficient development of post-launch features.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;EOP SCXW113089089&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When first enabling FaaS on Surface, we learned that the open source UEFI implementation &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tianocore/edk2&quot;&gt;TianoCore&lt;/a&gt; was not optimized for rapid servicing across multiple product lines. We spent several product cycles iterating on FaaS, and have now published the result as free, open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/mu/&quot;&gt;Project Mu&lt;/a&gt;! We are hopeful that the ecosystem will incorporate these ideas and code, as well as provide us with ongoing feedback to continue improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>K-Cup creator John Sylvan regrets inventing Keurig coffee pod system</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/k-cup-creator-john-sylvan-regrets-inventing-keurig-coffee-pod-system-1.2982660</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/k-cup-creator-john-sylvan-regrets-inventing-keurig-coffee-pod-system-1.2982660</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The man who invented the K-Cup coffee pod almost 20 years ago says he regrets doing so, and he can't understand the popularity of the products that critics decry as an environmental catastrophe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Sylvan worked at Keurig in the 1990s when he devised a simple product that could create a small mug of coffee out of a plastic pod. Originally aiming it at office workers, Sylvan said he thought the product might have some limited appeal to people who would normally go Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts or other coffee chains in the morning, because now they could get a cup of coffee at work that was &lt;span&gt;cheaper, faster, and no fuss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That would make it environmentally neutral, because you wouldn't have those Starbucks cups [everywhere],&quot; Sylvan told the CBC's As It Happens in an interview. &lt;span&gt;&quot;The first market was the office coffee service market,&quot; he said, adding he is &quot;absolutely mystified&quot; by his product's popularity in homes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billions of pods a year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popularity doesn't begin to describe it, as the K-Cup's status is closer to ubiquity. Keurig Green Mountain's annual revenues have climbed to almost $5 billion, up more than five-fold in five years, largely on the back of selling billions of K-Cups every year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keurig dominates what's come to be a large and growing market. Research firm NPD Group recently estimated that about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/1.2783633&quot;&gt;40 per cent of Canadian homes&lt;/a&gt; have a single-serving coffee machine, and Canadians spent $95 million on them last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a wildly popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/kill-the-k-cup-video-aims-to-show-environmental-impact-of-coffee-pods-1.2899027&quot;&gt;ad campaign against the product&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, there are so many discarded K-Cups that if you lined them up it would be enough to circle the earth more than 10 times — and that's just from one year's worth of coffee pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.2962517.1457472643!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/keurig-s-single-serving-k-cups.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;There's enough coffee pods discarded every year to circle the earth 10 times, critics of Keurig's ubiquitous machine say. (CBC Calgary)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the man who invented them, Sylvan might have been pleased with their popularity. But he left the company in 1997, selling his ownership of the product for $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, he still doesn't understand why people like them. &quot;I find them rather expensive,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how does he make coffee? &quot;I make a pot of coffee in the morning into a thermal carafe,&quot; he says. &quot;Before I go to bed … I put the coffee and water in, and when I wake up there's a pot of coffee,&quot; he deadpans. &quot;We throw away a lot of coffee but it's so cheap on a per-cup basis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee starts to deteriorate the minute it comes in contact with oxygen, which is why at grocery stores, coffee is typically either sold in a foil bag or an aluminum tin, because both are impervious to air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastic doesn't have the same properties, but the K-Cup basically achieves the same thing, while being able to be heated with hot water, by incorporating four different layers and types of plastic. That's problematic for recycling, because the process requires different recyclable materials to be separated into different groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its part, Keurig Green Mountain pledges to have fully recyclable K-Cups by 2020, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keuriggreenmountain.com/en/Sustainability/SustainableProducts/OurProducts/ReducingProductWaste.aspx&quot;&gt;by the company's own admission, the cups aren't recyclable at the moment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvan rejects the notion that K-Cups could ever be recyclable.  &quot;I don't care what Green Mountain says. You can't recycle that package,&quot; Sylvan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consumer choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he doesn't begrudge the company for its success, or for wanting to make money, but he does question consumers' slavish devotion to the things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's latest product, the Keurig 2.0, which allows users to use pods to make larger cups and pots of coffee, is a great example of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I stopped when I was walking in the grocery store aisle and I said, 'What is that?'&quot; Sylvan recalls. &quot;I picked it up and looked at it and said, 'You have to be kidding me.' Now they want you to make a pot of coffee with a Keurig machine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doubts the machines will ever be banned, since everyone who has bought one depends on the pods' existence. But he says consumers need to take a long hard look at their decisions, and make sure their decision to buy products is really worth their while in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;From a personal standpoint, it saves 20 seconds of your day,&quot; he says. &quot;What's that worth?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's other ways to do it, but they're not exploring other ways to do it,&quot; he says. &quot;They're going to make those little plastic cups forever, because they can't think outside the box.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;You can stick your head in the sand and ignore it, or you can address it from an engineering standpoint.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bye Bye Mongo, Hello Postgres</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/nov/30/bye-bye-mongo-hello-postgres</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/nov/30/bye-bye-mongo-hello-postgres</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At the Guardian, the majority of content – including articles, live blogs, galleries and video content – is produced in our in-house CMS tool, Composer. This, until recently, was backed by a Mongo DB database running on AWS. This database is essentially the “source of truth” for all Guardian content that has been published online – approximately 2.3m content items. We’ve just completed our migration away from Mongo to Postgres SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composer, and its database, originally started their lives in Guardian Cloud – a data centre in the basement of our office near Kings Cross, with a failover elsewhere in London. Our failover procedures were put to the test rather harshly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2015/jul/01/heatwave-live-britain-hottest-day-2015&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;one hot day in July 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Children play in the fountains outside the Hayward Gallery on the South Bank, London, enjoying the hot, sunny weather. Commissioned&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48189c1117bb212716a843c9aceb74ef1387da1d/140_264_4547_2727/master/4547.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=4d59424a104be68eac5423aebc84124b&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, the Guardian’s migration to AWS became that bit more urgent. We decided to purchase &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;OpsManager&lt;/a&gt; – Mongo’s database management software – along with a Mongo support contract – to help with the cloud migration. We used OpsManager to manage backups, handle orchestration and provide monitoring for our database cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to editorial requirements, we needed to run the database cluster and OpsManager on our own infrastructure in AWS rather than using Mongo’s managed database offering. This was non-trivial, as Mongo didn’t provide any tooling for getting set up easily on AWS – we needed to hand write the cloudformation to define all the infrastructure, and on top of that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/guardian/machine-images/tree/master/packer/resources/features/mongo24&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;we wrote hundreds of lines of ruby scripts&lt;/a&gt; to handle installation of monitoring/automation agents and orchestration of new DB instances. We ended up having to run knowledge sharing sessions about database management in the team – something we’d hoped OpsManager would make easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since migrating to AWS we’ve had two significant outages due to database problems, each preventing publication on theguardian.com for at least an hour. In both occasions neither OpsManager nor Mongo’s support agents were able to help us much, and we ended up solving the problem ourselves – in one case thanks to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sihil&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;member of the team&lt;/a&gt; picking up the phone from a desert on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi. Each of the issues could warrant a whole blog post in themselves, but the general take away points were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clocks are important – don’t lock down your VPC so much that NTP stops working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatically generating database indexes on application startup is probably a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database management is important and hard – and we’d rather not be doing it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;An array of clocks.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1ee5ce108720c858c673e56bfe19da53af8a50/0_130_5019_3011/master/5019.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=b64a067d690058739ad0beaffb08458a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpsManager didn’t really deliver on its promise of hassle-free database management. For instance, actually managing OpsManager itself – in particular upgrading from OpsManager 1 to 2 – was very time consuming, and required specialist knowledge about our OpsManager setup. It also didn’t deliver on its “one-click upgrade” promise, due to changes in the authentication schema between different versions of Mongo DB. We lost at least two months of engineering time a year doing this database management work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these problems, combined with the hefty annual fee we were paying for the support contract and OpsManager, left us looking for an alternative database option, with the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal database management required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption at rest supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A feasible migration path from Mongo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since all our other services are running in AWS, the obvious choice was DynamoDB – Amazon’s NoSQL database offering. Unfortunately at the time Dynamo didn’t support encryption at rest. After waiting around nine months for this feature to be added, we ended up giving up and looking for something else, ultimately choosing to use Postgres on AWS RDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But postgres isn’t a document store!” I hear you cry. Well, no, it isn’t, but it does have a JSONB column type, with support for indexes on fields within the JSON blob. We hoped that by using the JSONB type, we could migrate off Mongo onto Postgres with minimal changes to our data model. In addition, if we wanted to move to a more relational model in future we’d have that option. Another great thing about Postgres is how mature it is: every question we wanted to ask had in most cases already been answered on Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a performance perspective, we were confident Postgres could cope – whilst Composer is a write-heavy tool (it writes to the database every time a journalist stops typing) – there are normally only a few hundred concurrent users – not exactly high performance computing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part two – two decades of content migrated, no downtime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Postgres takes a bite out of mongo&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd421d5de76ec12d96b8d741db76810b0561933/0_164_4667_2802/master/4667.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=b485e6bc572d5a5a40caa9ed6c37f8c8&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most database migrations involve the same steps and ours was no exception. Here are the steps we took to migrate the database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the new database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a way to write to the new database (new API).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a proxy that sends traffic to both the old and the new database, using the old one as primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrate records from the old database into the new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the new database the primary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete the old database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the database we were migrating powers our CMS, it was important the migration caused as little disruption as possible for our journalists. After all, the news never stops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work began on the new Postgres-powered API towards the end of July 2017. And so our journey begins. But to understand the journey we need to first understand where we started from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our simplified CMS architecture was something like this: a database, an API, and several apps talking to it (such as the web frontend). The stack was, and still is, built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-lang.org/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scalatra.org/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Scalatra Framework&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Angular.js&lt;/a&gt; and it is about four years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some investigation we concluded that before we could migrate existing content, we needed a way to talk to the new PostgreSQL database and still have the old API running as usual. After all, the Mongo database is our source of truth. It offered us a safety blanket while experimenting with the new API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why building on top of the old API wasn’t an option. There was very little separation of concern in the original API and MongoDB specifics could be found even at the controller level. As a result the task of adding another database type in the existing API was too risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went down a different route instead and duplicated the old API. And this is how APIV2 was born. It was more or less an exact replica of the Mongo one and included the same endpoints and functionality. We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;doobie&lt;/a&gt;, a pure functional JDBC layer for Scala, added &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; for running locally and testing, and improved logging and separation of concerns. APIV2 was going to be a fast and modern API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of August 2017 we had a new API deployed that was using PostgreSQL as its database. But this was only the beginning. There are articles in the Mongo database that were first created over two decades ago and all of these needed to be moved to the Postgres database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Migrating to postgres for the winter&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c2a6f921775553760a8f2b4ca5249853aaf40dc/0_285_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=cf435cf4e833206f73d42b1e5620d9c1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Migration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be able to edit any article on the site regardless of when they were published, so all articles exist in our database as the single “source of truth”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all of the articles live in the Guardian’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://open-platform.theguardian.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Content API&lt;/a&gt; (CAPI), which powers the apps and website, getting the migration right was key as our database is the ‘source of truth’. If anything were to happen to the CAPI’s Elasticsearch cluster then we would reindex it from Composer’s database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, before turning off Mongo we had to be confident that the same request on the Postgres powered API and the Mongo-powered API would return identical responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this we needed to copy all content to the new Postgres database. This was done using a script that talked directly to the old and new APIs. The advantage of doing it this way was that the APIs already provided a well tested interface for reading and writing articles to and from the databases, as opposed to writing something that accessed the relevant databases directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic flow for the migration was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get content from Mongo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post content to Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get content from Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check that the responses from one and three are identical&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A database migration has only really gone well if your end users are completely unaware that it has happened and a good migration script was always going to be an essential part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind we needed a script that could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure that after migrating a piece of content, the response from both APIs matched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop if there was an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produce detailed logs to help diagnose issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart from the correct point after an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started off using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ammonite.io/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Ammonite&lt;/a&gt;. Ammonite allows you to write scripts in Scala, which is the primary language on our team. This was a good opportunity to experiment with something we’d not used before to see if it would be useful for us. Although Ammonite allowed us to use a familiar language there were downsides. Whilst Intellij now &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2017/11/28/intellij-idea-scala-plugin-2017-3-lightbend-project-starter-ammonite-support-parallel-indexing-and-more/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;supports Ammonite&lt;/a&gt;, at the time it did not, which meant we lost autocomplete and automatic imports. It was also not possible to run an Ammonite script for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Ammonite was not the right tool for the job and we used an sbt project instead to perform the migration. The approach we took allowed us to work in a language we were confident in and perform multiple ‘test migrations’ until we were confident to run it in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was unexpected was how useful this would be in testing the Postgres API. We found several subtle bugs and edge cases in the new API that we had not found before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to January 2017, and it was time to test a complete migration in CODE, our pre-production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to most of our systems, the only similarity between CODE and PROD is the version of the application they are running. The AWS infrastructure backing the CODE environment was far less powerful than PROD simply because it receives far less usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a migration on CODE would help us to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimate how long a migration on PROD would take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assess what impact, if any, a migration would have on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to get an accurate measurement of these metrics, we had to match the two environments. This involved restoring a backup of the PROD mongo database into CODE and updating the AWS backed infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating just over 2m items of content was going to take a long time, certainly more than office hours. So we ran the script in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;screen sessio&lt;/a&gt;n overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to measure the progress of the migration, we shipped structured logs (using markers) to our ELK stack. From here, we could create detailed dashboards, tracking the number of articles successfully migrated, the number of failures and the overall progress. Additionally, these were displayed on a big screen near the team to provide greater visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the migration had finished, we employed the same techniques to check each document in Postgres matched Mongo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part three – Proxy and running in production&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the new Postgres-powered API was running we needed to test it with real life traffic and data access patterns to ensure it was reliable and stable. There were two possible ways to achieve this: update each client that talks to the Mongo API to talk to both APIs; or run a proxy that’ll do this. We wrote a proxy in Scala using &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/stream/index.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Akka Streams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proxy was fairly simple in its operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept traffic from a load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward the traffic to the primary api and return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asynchronously forward the same traffic to the secondary api.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculate any difference between the two responses and log them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start, the proxy was logging a lot of differences between the responses of the two APIs, surfacing some very subtle but important behavioural differences in the APIs that needed to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structured logging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we do logging at the Guardian is by using an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;ELK&lt;/a&gt; stack. Using Kibana gave us the flexibility to surface logs in a way that would be most useful to us. Kibana uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;lucene query syntax&lt;/a&gt; that is fairly easy to learn. But we soon realised that filtering out logs or grouping them was not possible in the current setup. For example, we weren’t able to filter out logs sent as a result of GET requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution was to send more structured logs to Kibana rather than sending only a message. One log entry contains multiple fields, like the timestamp, the name of the app that sent the log or the stack. Adding new fields programmatically is very easy. These structured fields are called markers and they can be implemented using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;logstash-logback-encoder&lt;/a&gt; library. For each request we extracted the useful information (eg path, method, status code) and created a map with the additional information we needed to log. Have a look at the example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-scala&quot;&gt;import akka.http.scaladsl.model.HttpRequest
import ch.qos.logback.classic.{Logger =&amp;gt; LogbackLogger}
import net.logstash.logback.marker.Markers
import org.slf4j.{LoggerFactory, Logger =&amp;gt; SLFLogger}

import scala.collection.JavaConverters._

object Logging {
 val rootLogger: LogbackLogger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SLFLogger.ROOT_LOGGER_NAME).asInstanceOf[LogbackLogger]

 private def setMarkers(request: HttpRequest) = {
   val markers = Map(
     &quot;path&quot; -&amp;gt; request.uri.path.toString(),
     &quot;method&quot; -&amp;gt; request.method.value
   )
   Markers.appendEntries(markers.asJava)
 }

 def infoWithMarkers(message: String, akkaRequest: HttpRequest) =
   rootLogger.info(setMarkers(akkaRequest), message)
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional structure in our logs allowed us to build useful dashboards and add more context around our diffs, which helped us identify some of the smaller inconsistencies between the APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Replicating traffic and proxy refactoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having migrated content into the CODE database we ended up with an almost exact replica of the PROD database. The major difference was CODE had no traffic. For replicating real traffic into the CODE environment we used an open-source tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://goreplay.org/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;GoReplay&lt;/a&gt; (gor). It’s very easy to set up and it’s customisable to suit your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all traffic coming into our APIs was hitting the proxy first it made sense to install gor on the proxy boxes. See below how to download gor on your box and how to start capturing traffic on port 80 and send it to another server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wget https://github.com/buger/goreplay/releases/download/v0.16.0.2/gor_0.16.0_x64.tar.gz

tar -xzf gor_0.16.0_x64.tar.gz gor

sudo gor --input-raw :80 --output-http http://apiv2.code.co.uk&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything worked fine for a while, but very soon we experienced an outage on production when the proxy became unavailable for a couple of minutes. Upon investigation we found all three boxes on which the proxy was running cycled at the same time. Our suspicion was that gor was using too many resources and was causing the proxy to fall over. On further investigation we found in the AWS Console that the boxes had been regularly cycling, but not at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going any deeper, we tried to find a way to still run gor, but this time without putting any more pressure on the proxy. The solution came from our secondary stack for Composer. This stack is only used in case of emergency and it has our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2016/dec/05/testing-in-production-how-we-combined-tests-with-monitoring&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;production monitoring tool&lt;/a&gt; constantly running tests against it. Replaying traffic from this stack to CODE at double the speed worked without any issues this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings raised a lot of questions. The proxy had been built with the idea that it would only exist temporarily, so it perhaps hadn’t been as carefully designed as other apps. Also, it was built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Akka Http&lt;/a&gt;, which none of the team members had used before. The code was messy and full of quick fixes. We decided to start a big refactoring job to improve readability that included using for comprehensions instead of the growing nested logic we had before, and adding even more logging markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were hoping that by taking time to understand how everything worked and by simplifying the logic we’d be able to stop the boxes from cycling. But this didn’t work. After about two weeks of trying to make the proxy more reliable we were starting to feel like we were falling deeper and deeper down a rabbit hole. A decision had to be made. We agreed to take the risk and leave it as it was it was better to spend the time on the actual migration than trying to fix a piece of software that was going to be gone in a month’s time. We paid for this decision by going through two more production outages, each lasting about two minutes, but overall it was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to March 2017 and we had now finished migrating CODE, with no detrimental impact on performance of the API or user experience in the CMS. We could now start to think about decommissioning the proxy in CODE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage of this was to change the priorities of the APIs, so that the proxy talked to Postgres first. As previously mentioned this was configuration based. However there was one complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composer sends messages on a Kinesis stream when a document has been updated. In order to avoid message duplication, only one API should send these messages. The APIs have a flag in configuration for this; the value was true for the Mongo backed API and false for the Postgres backed one. Simply changing the proxy to talk to Postgres first wasn’t enough as the message wouldn’t get sent on the Kinesis stream until the request reached Mongo too. This was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this, we created HTTP endpoints to change the config in memory across all instances in the load balancer instantaneously. This allowed us to very quickly switch which API was primary without needing to edit a config file and redeploy. Additionally, this could be scripted, reducing human interaction and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all requests were going to Postgres first and API2 was talking to Kinesis, the change could be made permanent via config and a redeploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stage was to remove the proxy entirely and get clients to solely talk to the Postgres API. As there are numerous clients, updating each of them individually wasn’t really viable. Therefore, we pushed this up to the DNS. That is, we created a CNAME in DNS that, at first, pointed to the proxy’s ELB and would change to point to the API ELB. This allowed a single change to be made rather than updating each individual client of the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now time to migrate PROD. Although slightly scary because, well, it’s production. The process was relatively simple as everything was based on configuration. Additionally, as we add a stage marker to the logs, it was also possible to repurpose the previously built dashboards simply by updating the Kibana filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Switching off the proxy and MongoDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten months and 2.4m migrated articles later, we were finally in a position to switch off all the Mongo related infrastructure. But first, the moment we’d all been waiting for: kill the proxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This small piece of software caused us so many issues we couldn’t wait to turn it off! All we needed to do was update the CNAME record to point directly at the APIV2 load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team gathered around one computer. The switch was one click away. No one was breathing anymore. Complete silence. Click! And the change was out. Nothing broke! We all relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, deleting the old MongoDB API was another challenge. While frantically deleting old code we found that our integration tests have never been changed to use the new API. Everything turned red quickly. Fortunately, most of the issues were configuration related and therefore easy to fix. But there were a couple of issues with the PostgreSQL queries that were caught by the tests. Trying to think of things we could have done to avoid this error, we realised that when starting a big piece of work you also have to accept that you’re going to make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that came afterwards worked smoothly. We detached all the Mongo instances from OpsManager and then terminated them. The only thing left to do was celebrate. And get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
