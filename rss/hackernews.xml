<title>Trust-Busting as the Unsexy Answer to Google and Facebook</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;JANUARY 28, 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE ARE TWO TYPES of books in the Silicon Valley canon: books on programming and blockbuster memoirs by entrepreneurs. When I moved to San Francisco after graduating college, I had read just enough of the first kind to land a software job. After receiving my company-issued hoodie and learning the hard way when not to wear it (at parties), I decided it was time to catch up on the second kind of book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed is that the West Coast techie strain of elitism is far more flagrant than the East Coast strain I was used to. For instance, in his memoir, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone announces that he has come up with a new “social good”–oriented definition of capitalism (fact check: he is actually just repackaging Andrew Carnegie’s 1889 “The Gospel of Wealth,” a treatise justifying the concentration of wealth as a means of promoting public welfare). Among his catalog of good deeds: switching his company from bottled to filtered tap water (bottles of Starbucks’s Ethos Water available for visitors) and reserving the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RED&quot;&gt;@red&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Twitter handle for Bono’s humanitarian brand. Truly, he is virtuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not just the feigned benevolence nor the arrogance that struck me in these memoirs but how these self-made millionaires talk about consuming, rather than overcoming, competition. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen celebrates software companies’ “eating the world,” ingesting entrenched industries in their path. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, declares that &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536&quot;&gt;“competition is for losers,”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and claims that companies can only reach their highest creative potential if they don’t waste energy fending off pesky competition. Capitalism, according to all these men, is about frictionless, seamless engorgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their argument that monopolies can be good for the economy and good for consumers is not new — it does not originate in Silicon Valley, as their memoirs would have us believe. It emerged in the late 19th century during the United States’s Gilded Age, advanced by men of unprecedented wealth, like J. P. Morgan, the steel, shipping, rail, banking, and electricity magnate; Andrew Carnegie, the union crusher unafraid of violence; and John D. Rockefeller, the oil man who at his death was worth roughly three times Jeff Bezos in today’s dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is different, then, is what might be called the stylistics. For one thing, the image of those old top hat–clad robber barons with their cultivated urbaneness is sartorially different from that of today’s hoodie-clad tech titans. And for another, their business tactics are different. The major tech companies don’t extort the public and shake down competitors like the monopolies of old. They give us what we want, or think we want, offering most of their services for free (email, messaging, maps, cloud storage, et cetera). On the whole, consolidation in tech seems actually to help consumers. Or does it?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Wu’s &lt;em&gt;The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age&lt;/em&gt;, a history of antitrust in the United States, makes a compelling case that it doesn’t. More generally, he argues that we are, in fact, in an all-out return of the Gilded Age — and perhaps only the clothing has changed. A professor at Columbia Law School known for coining the term “net neutrality,” Wu argues that the very bigness of present-day companies — especially those in the tech sector — does not just harm consumers, but that it also threatens innovation and undermines the power of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: His prescription to end the new Gilded Age is the same bitter pill that ended the old one — trust-busting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth revisiting the history of trust-busting, which he does in some detail in his book. During the first Gilded Age, powerful trusts were celebrated as an embodiment of social Darwinism — in other words, as survival of the fittest. As Rockefeller himself said, “The American Beauty rose can be produced in the splendor and fragrance which bring cheer to its beholder only by sacrificing the early buds which grow up around it.” Between 1895 and 1904, the number of manufacturing companies operating in the United States declined from 2,274 to a mere 157. Those who survived, including General Electric, US Steel, Standard Oil, and AT&amp;amp;T, used predatory-pricing exclusionary cartels and virulent lobbyists to keep rivals at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few businesses were safe from the trusts, especially from the United States’s most aggressive bud clipper, Rockefeller himself. In 1904, investigative journalist Ida Tarbell said that, for him, “nothing was too small: the corner grocery store in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipe line. Nothing, for little things grow.” Tarbell’s 19-part exposé on Rockefeller’s Standard Oil would mark a turning point in setting public sentiment against the trusts. And it set the stage for one of the earliest antitrust cases, led by President Theodore Roosevelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he venerated size and power, Roosevelt forcefully brought his big stick down on the likes of Rockefeller because he understood that the Gilded Age trusts posed existential threats to the power of government. Fewer firms meant more powerful firms that could easily coordinate on prices and unify their lobbying efforts to change laws in their favor. He cleverly gave teeth to the vaguely worded Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, which he then strategically deployed to win landmark cases. In the process, he became known as the trust-buster par excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After World War II, trust-busting became a bipartisan issue undergirding American nationalism. This was in part because people blamed German monopolists for enabling Hitler’s rise to power. Support for antitrust continued to grow until it reached fever pitch in the 1960s. The Johnson administration was so aggressively litigious that it prevented the merger of two Los Angeles–based grocery chains, Von’s Grocery and Shopping Bag Food, which together would have controlled a mere 7.5 percent of market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was in this very same period, 600 miles west of Washington, that the ideological wheels favoring the return of bigness were already in motion, according to Wu. Known as the Chicago School, a group of libertarian, classical economists at the University of Chicago, including the conservative intellectual heavyweight Robert Bork, were arguing that the sole purpose of the Sherman Act was to promote “consumer welfare.” Monopolies, they said, should only be broken up if they raised prices for consumers, and not simply because they were too big or anti-competitive. When a young Bork first presented his thesis on the consumer welfare standard in 1964, he was considered to be on the “lunatic fringe,” but within 20 years his thesis would shape the majority opinion of the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Wu and others have rightly pointed out, the straightforward Chicago School standard overlooks, among other things, the stifling effect monopolies can have on innovation. As a case in point: when AT&amp;amp;T was broken up in 1984, a torrent of new products came on the market, everything from the first answering machines to early ISPs. Until then, “Ma Bell” had prevented other businesses from selling attachments to its phone jacks. Antitrust again shaped the internet in 1998 with the defunct case against Microsoft. Microsoft could easily have crushed early internet companies like Google and Amazon in their infancies if not for regulatory scrutiny, which effectively stopped it from forcing users onto Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, despite what Thiel says about the creative potential of unbridled monopolies, it feels like we are again in one of those innovation bottlenecks. In the decade between 1998 and 2008, the tech sector went from stuffing mailboxes with AOL free-trial CDs to releasing the iPhone 3G, Google Docs, Amazon Prime, and the Facebook News Feed. Another 10 years on, our technology actually looks much the same, and the promises of virtual reality, IoT, chatbots, and blockchain continue to elude us. And yet the value (and influence) of the big tech companies has only grown, now making up &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2018&quot;&gt;five of the top six&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; most valuable companies in the world by market cap. In 2008, none were in the top six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter the third presidential administration in a row without a major antitrust case, and with none on the horizon, tech companies are consolidating with impunity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn1&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; The software that is “eating the world” is eating itself too — Facebook has made 67 straight unchallenged acquisitions, including competitors Instagram and WhatsApp; Amazon has made 91 acquisitions, including Whole Foods; and Google has made 214, including Waze and YouTube. Budding companies that resist being acquired are pruned through &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/silicon-copy/&quot;&gt;flagrant copying.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Snapchat experienced this firsthand when its stock price and user base crumbled as soon as its signature “story” feature appeared almost simultaneously on Facebook Inc.’s four largest platforms, Instagram, Messenger, Facebook, and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Gilded Age even holds the risk of something unprecedented in the United States: an undemocratic alliance between big tech companies and the government. In &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJMAx91hANE&quot;&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, Wu said that, referring to while he was an advisor to the FCC,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is always trying to be helpful because they want to be our friends, in government … so they came over and they say something like … “We know what everybody’s faces in the world look like, so if you’re looking for someone, let us know.” Now they said this in the context of missing children … [but] you can see that, pretty quickly, if you have a company which has spying powers that actually frankly transcend those of the CIA or the FBI … you have the possibility of totalitarianism that we’ve never really fully witnessed …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Curse of Bigness&lt;/em&gt; leaves room for optimism in two ways. First, Wu offers a number of specific recommendations (some of them perhaps too specific to be readily understood by a general audience) on how to strengthen antitrust law, including reviewing more mergers, increasing opportunities for public comment, having the government once again take on big cases, and generally moving away from the “consumer welfare” definition of antitrust toward one of protecting competition. Second, he argues that the economies of scale that incentivize bigness are only beneficial up to the point when they become “diseconomies of scale.” In other words, layers of management and internal control systems eventually make larger companies less efficient. So long as they cannot change the rules of the game, they become less competitive as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book, &lt;em&gt;The Internet Trap: How the Digital Economy Builds Monopolies and Undermines Democracy&lt;/em&gt;, casts doubt, however, even on these two glimmers of optimism. Its author, Matthew Hindman, a media studies professor at George Washington University, argues that the rules governing tech are different — bigness inherently translates into the kind of dominance that prunes the sector down to a few winners and a whole lot of losers. He adamantly disputes the claims of yesteryear that the internet is a Wild West meritocracy, where any programmer with grit, gumption, and a good idea could succeed. The internet does not create a level playing field — and nowadays only PR professionals still believe that &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2009/05/googles-approach-to-competition.html&quot;&gt;“competition is just one click away.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet Trap&lt;/em&gt; does a good job pulling back the curtain on how big tech companies make themselves ever bigger: by making major infrastructure investments to give themselves small but compounding advantages. Google learned the hard way that speed can be one such key advantage (or disadvantage) when, in 2000, the search engine experimented with showing 20, 25, and 30 results at a time instead of 10. The change added only half a second to the page’s load time, but that slight delay led to a 20 percent drop in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Google’s lodestar has been the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/the-google-gospel-of-speed-urs-hoelzle/&quot;&gt;“gospel of speed.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; That gospel has reshaped the geography of the internet, creating barriers to entry for competitors along the way. Google has laid undersea fiber-optic cables, built data centers inside of local ISPs, and spent a good chunk of its &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/9/1/16236506/tech-amazon-apple-gdp-spending-productivity&quot;&gt;$13.9 billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; annual research and development budget, all in the name of a few milliseconds. As Hindman puts it, “Most sites cannot build a new web browser, and then make it the most popular in the world, in order to speed up their site.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn2&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindman’s underlying claim is that if one website has a wide array of content that frequently updates itself and is also tailored to users’ interests, then that website will dominate their attention. But, again, the advantage of bigness holds: the expenditure behind a feature like personalization is only feasible for the largest companies. Recommendation systems, the engines of personalization and the secret sauces behind Google’s search algorithm and Facebook’s News Feed, constitute a massive fixed cost for tech businesses but can bring about exponential growth. Hindman chronicles just how expensive they can be in his account of the Netflix Prize, a one-million-dollar reward offered by the then-DVD-rental service to the researchers who could improve the accuracy of their rating prediction algorithm by one-10th of a star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hindman points out, the prize allows for a rare public glimpse into the challenges of building recommendation systems. With the contest spanning 2,000 active teams from 152 countries working over three years, many teams had to join forces after the first year to remain competitive and eke out small improvements. Eventually two supergroups emerged — BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos and a 23-team Hydra called “The Ensemble.” In the end, BellKor’s winning solution took more than 2,000 hours of work and included 107 algorithms. By the time the competition was over, Netflix had already pivoted to streaming and the algorithm &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-1-55838468f429&quot;&gt;was never used in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn3&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindman covers other topics, but the book loses cohesion after the first half when it becomes mired in the statistics and academic jargon of Hindman’s own research. His economic models of the web, of internet traffic, and of local news consumption feel like tangents about methodology and fail to paint a clear picture of internet centralization. By the end of the book, Hindman shifts to advising small local newspapers on how to escape the maw of tech behemoths, and his advice — faster load times, better design, more frequent site updates, increased focus on headlines — feels like too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the specter of the Chicago School, the advantages of entrenched tech companies, and the monopolistic evangelism touted by Stone, Andreessen, and Thiel, the pendulum may be finally swinging against bigness. Besides Wu and Hindman, a group of “Neo-Brandeisian” legal scholars have started to question the legality of the tech hegemons under the Sherman Act. Most prominent among them is Lina Khan, a 29-year-old legal wunderkind whose antitrust paper on Amazon in &lt;em&gt;The Yale Law Journal&lt;/em&gt; sent reverberations across legal and political spheres. In example after example, her paper highlights how the consumer welfare view of antitrust fails to curb the predatory pricing and vertical integration strategies Amazon uses in its relentless pursuit of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, looking across the political landscape, it is unclear who the David is to take on the tech Goliaths. Republicans are cozy with big business, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftn4&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Democrats are cozy with &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html&quot;&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/04/22/googles-remarkably-close-relationship-with-the-obama-white-house-in-two-charts/&quot;&gt;interests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and constituents may not rally behind the issue on their own if the flow of information is controlled by the companies under threat. Still, the ideas are out there, and thanks to recent media coverage, they have penetrated the popular imagination. Perhaps this generation of Silicon Valley migrants will not read the memoirs of self-important entrepreneurs that I slogged through as a young programmer, but rather the work of anti-establishment academics like Wu, Hindman, and Khan. And then, the phrase “trust-buster” may well return to American lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/gabriel-nicholas/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gabriel Nicholas is a writer, researcher, and programmer whose work focuses on social issues in technology. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftnref1&quot; name=&quot;_ftn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; When there have been antitrust cases, it is often to &lt;em&gt;defend&lt;/em&gt; tech companies, such as in 2012 when the DOJ sued publishers for colluding to raise the price on popular ebooks. Amazon could set predatory prices because they could recoup their losses over the long-term by locking users to the Kindle platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftnref2&quot; name=&quot;_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; All of this infrastructure also means that big tech companies can move more quickly to address competitors. For example, in November when Facebook released Lasso, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/lasso-facebook-app-store/&quot;&gt;its clone of the popular short-form music video app TikTok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, the company already had uploading, video serving, and recommendation technologies it could use from its other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftnref3&quot; name=&quot;_ftn3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; The Netflix Prize also brought a boom in original research, particularly around restricted Boltzmann machines and singular value decomposition. Netflix used a blend of these two methods until at least 2012. The competition was enough of a success that Netflix attempted to run it again, but they were stopped in 2010 by an FTC lawsuit over privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/trust-busting-as-the-unsexy-answer-to-google-and-facebook/#_ftnref4&quot; name=&quot;_ftn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Republicans were not always anti-antitrust. It was Richard Nixon who in 1974 started the case that would eventually break up AT&amp;amp;T, then the largest company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>If Software Is Funded from a Public Source, Its Code Should Be Open Source</title>
<link>https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-software-funded-public-source-its-code-should-be-open-source</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-software-funded-public-source-its-code-should-be-open-source</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we pay for it, we should be able to use it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because many free software coders have been outsiders and rebels, less attention is paid to the use of open source in government departments than in other contexts. But it's an important battleground, not least because there are special dynamics at play and lots of good reasons to require open-source software. It's unfortunate that the most famous attempt to convert a government IT system from proprietary code to open source—the city of Munich—proved such a difficult experience. Although last year saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/end-of-an-open-source-era-linux-pioneer-munich-confirms-switch-to-windows-10&quot;&gt;a decision to move back to Windows&lt;/a&gt;, that seems to be more a failure of IT management, than of the code itself. Moreover, it's worth remembering that the Munich project began back in 2003, when it was a trailblazer. Today, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/linux-to-windows-10-why-did-munich-switch-and-why-does-it-matter&quot;&gt;dozens of large-scale migrations&lt;/a&gt;, as TechRepublic reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notable is perhaps the French Gendarmerie, the country's police force, which has switched 70,000 PCs to Gendbuntu, a custom version of the Linux-based OS Ubuntu. In the same country 15 French ministries have made the switch to using LibreOffice, as has the Dutch Ministry of Defence, while the Italian Ministry of Defence will switch more than 100,000 desktops from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice by 2020 and 25,000 PCs at hospitals in Copenhagen will move from Office to LibreOffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More are coming through all the time. The Municipality of Tirana, the biggest in Albania, has just announced it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2018/11/22/municipality-of-tirana&quot;&gt;moving thousands of desktops to LibreOffice&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/growing-100-2020&quot;&gt;80% of the city of Barcelona's IT investment this year&lt;/a&gt; will be in open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor driving this uptake by innovative government departments is the potential to cut costs by avoiding constant upgrade fees. But it's important not to overstate the &quot;free as in beer&quot; element here. All major software projects have associated costs of implementation and support. Departments choosing free software simply because they believe it will save lots of money in obvious ways are likely to be disappointed, and that will be bad for open source's reputation and future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably as important as any cost savings is the use of open standards. This ensures that there is no lock-in to a proprietary solution, and it makes the long-term access and preservation of files much easier. For governments with a broader responsibility to society than simply saving money, that should be a key consideration, even if it hasn't been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-source advocates have rightly noted that free software is a natural fit for any organization that requires solutions based on open standards, interoperability and re-usable components—key elements of the European Commission's new &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/strategy/decision-making_process/documents/ec_digitalstrategy_en.pdf&quot;&gt;digital strategy&lt;/a&gt;, for example. One of the leaders here is the UK government. In 2014, it announced a new policy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/22/making-things-open-making-things-better&quot;&gt;&quot;Making things open, making things better&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. It achieved this by setting &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/OpenDocument-v1.2.html&quot;&gt;Open Document Format for Office Applications Version 1.2&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/sharing-or-collaborating-with-government-documents&quot;&gt;default format&lt;/a&gt; for sharing or collaborating with UK government documents. It's produced an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2018/04/27/open-document-format-in-government-an-update&quot;&gt;review of how things have gone in the last four years&lt;/a&gt;, which concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot have important documents published in formats which do not meet open standards. Government documents are for everyone. Whether you're using Windows, Mac, GNU/Linux, Chrome OS, iOS, Android, or any other system—you have the right to read what we have written and we will continue on our journey to make documents open and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of open standards is not the only big benefit of moving to open source. Another is transparency. Recently it emerged that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/impact-assessment-shows-privacy-risks-microsoft-office-proplus-enterprise&quot;&gt;Microsoft has been gathering personal information&lt;/a&gt; from 300,000 government users of Microsoft Office ProPlus in the Netherlands, without permission and without documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Covertly, without informing people. Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected, because the data stream is encoded. Similar to this practice in Windows 10, Microsoft has included separate software in the Office software that regularly sends telemetry data to its own servers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to open-source solutions does not guarantee that personal data will not leak out, but it does ensure that the problems, once found, can be fixed quickly by government IT departments—something that isn't the case for closed-source products. This is a powerful reason why public funds should mean open source—or as a site created by the Free Software Foundation Europe puts it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://publiccode.eu&quot;&gt;&quot;If it is public money, it should be public code as well&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site points out some compelling reasons why any government code produced with public money should be free software. They will all be familiar enough to readers of &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt;. For example, publicly funded code that is released as open source can be used by different departments, and even different governments, to solve similar problems. That opens the way for feedback and collaboration, producing better code and faster innovation. And open-source code is automatically available to the people who paid for it—members of the public. They too might be able to offer suggestions for improvement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/fossa/#bugbounty&quot;&gt;find bugs&lt;/a&gt; or build on it to produce exciting new applications. None of these is possible if government code is kept locked up by companies that write it on behalf of taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the natural fit of open source with public computing is evident. Indeed, when you think about it, it seems ridiculous that public money would be used to produce anything but public code. The Basque Country understood that back in 2012 and brought in a law that required all &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/basque-countrys-open-source&quot;&gt;software developed for the government there should be released as open source&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, the Canadian government has made the connection too. Its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249&quot;&gt;Directive on Management of Information Technology&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where possible, use open standards and open source software first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a custom-built application is the appropriate option, by default any source code written by the government must be released in an open format via Government of Canada websites and services designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that this approach is not already the norm is something of a failure on the part of the Free Software community. Perhaps it's time to drop the snobbery about open source in government and put more effort into turning it into the next huge win for the world of free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registered nurse Ebony Monroe of Houston recently went through a period of being quick to anger about every little thing. She didn't realize then what it might mean for her health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you had told me in the beginning that my irritability was related to depression, I would probably be livid,&quot; Monroe says with a laugh. &quot;I did not think irritability aligned with depression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's not alone. Many people — including physicians — associate depression with feelings of hopelessness, sadness and a lack of motivation or concentration, but not anger. Some researchers say that's a problem, given that there appears to be a strong link between irritability and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res690308758&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;

Try Naming It To Tame It&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pick up what is often called the &quot;bible of psychiatry,&quot; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm&quot;&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, you'll find that the list of core symptoms for major depression doesn't include anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not included at all in the adult classification of depression,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/doctor.aspx?id=16784&quot;&gt;Dr. Maurizio Fava&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he points out that irritability — a reduced control over one's temper that results in angry outbursts — &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; listed as a core symptom of depression for children and adolescents. It has never made sense to him that it's not included for adults. &quot;Why would someone who happens to be irritable and angry when depressed as an adolescent suddenly stop being angry at age 18?&quot; he asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger is an emotional and physical feeling that makes people want to warn, intimidate or attack a person who is perceived as threatening. Fava says a depressed adult with lots of anger is often assumed to have bipolar disorder or a personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We see in our clinics patients who are labeled as having other diagnoses because people think, 'Well, you shouldn't be so angry if you are depressed,' &quot; says Fava. The diagnosis matters because it affects the kind of treatment people get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when he was trained decades ago, Fava says, he was taught that in depression, anger is projected inward — that depressed people would be angry at themselves but not at others. That didn't match what he was seeing in a lot of his patients with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res690308822&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage688620302&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/29/688620302/from-fruit-fly-to-stink-eye-searching-for-angers-animal-roots&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2019\/01\/29\/688620302\/from-fruit-fly-to-stink-eye-searching-for-angers-animal-roots&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/28/anger_2_final_4.1_sq-7fd3395345877ba0b94b519c5a27b11cec41dba8-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/28/anger_2_final_4.1_sq-7fd3395345877ba0b94b519c5a27b11cec41dba8-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;From Fruit Fly To Stink Eye: Searching For Anger's Animal Roots&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would say 1 in 3 patients would report to me that they would lose their temper, they would get angry, they would throw things or yell and scream or slam the door,&quot; says Fava. Afterward, these people would be filled with remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fava thinks these &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10418810&quot;&gt;anger attacks&lt;/a&gt;&quot; may be a phenomenon that is similar to panic attacks. His &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9840194&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that this kind of anger subsided in the majority of patients treated with antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry has carefully studied how anxiety and depressed mood are experienced by patients, notes Fava, but anger has been relatively neglected. &quot;I don't think that we have really examined all the variables and all the levels of anger dysregulation that people experience,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That view is shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mzimmerm&quot;&gt;Dr. Mark Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at Brown University. &quot;The field has not sufficiently attended to problems with anger,&quot; says Zimmerman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most frequently used scales to evaluate whether or not medications work for treating depression don't have any anger-specific items,&quot; he notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Zimmerman says clinicians frequently see increased anger in people who come to doctors seeking help. &quot;Irritability is not that much less frequent than sadness and anxiety in patients who are presenting for psychiatric treatment,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman and some colleagues recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-06653-007&quot;&gt;surveyed&lt;/a&gt; thousands of patients who were making their first visit to the Rhode Island Hospital's outpatient psychiatric practice. All were asked about the level of anger they had felt or expressed in the preceding week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two-thirds of individuals reported notable irritability and anger,&quot; he says, &quot;and approximately half reported it at a moderate or severe level.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another large &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1737169&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by a different research group looked at more than 500 people who had been diagnosed with major depression. It found that more than half showed &quot;overt irritability/anger,&quot; and that this anger and irritability appeared to be associated with more severe, chronic depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monroe, the nurse, was lucky enough to have a concerned friend who gently suggested that maybe she should talk to someone. &quot;The way that she approached me decreased that wall of anger and anxiety,&quot; says Monroe, &quot;and that's when I decided to seek the help.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monroe came to realize that traumatic events from her childhood had left her depressed and full of unresolved anger. With nowhere for that anger to go, she was lashing out at loved ones like her sister and husband. &quot;So they caught the back end of my irritability when, in fact, they had nothing to do with the source of it,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a year of counseling, her life has improved a lot, Monroe says. She now works with a group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.familyaware.org/&quot;&gt;Families for Depression Awareness&lt;/a&gt; to help others recognize the signs of depression. Its list of symptoms that families should watch for includes &quot;picking fights, being irritable, critical, or mean.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res690310000&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage674212217&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/12/18/674212217/a-new-way-to-get-college-students-through-a-psychiatric-crisis-and-back-to-schoo&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2018\/12\/18\/674212217\/a-new-way-to-get-college-students-through-a-psychiatric-crisis-and-back-to-schoo&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/06/final_02_sq-b04b3bba33302e2d2f072ca5d0bee921cbf258de-s100-c15.jpeg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/06/final_02_sq-b04b3bba33302e2d2f072ca5d0bee921cbf258de-s100.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;A New Way To Get College Students Through A Psychiatric Crisis — And Back To School&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, people with depression can have a hard time recognizing this in their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I called up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure2.convio.net/dabsa/site/SPageServer/?pagename=home&quot;&gt;Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to ask about anger, I reached its communications person, Kevin Einbinder. He initially thought to himself, &quot;I'm sure somebody else certainly deals with anger, but I don't have anger issues associated with depression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he started reflecting on his life with depression over the past three decades. &quot;I thought of all the people in my life who have interacted with me — my family, the counselors, psychiatrists, even employers, significant others,&quot; he says, &quot;and I realized that anger was an underlying factor in all those relationships.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, he used to use caustic, sarcastic humor to put people down. &quot;This really drove people away,&quot; says Einbinder. He also recalls sending angry emails late at night after lying awake and ruminating about things that had happened during the day. A counselor helped him see why this wasn't such a good way to handle problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, he and his caregivers never focused on anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, he says, he really wishes they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that would have provided a tremendous amount of context for what's adding to my depression and in helping me, early on in my life, with more effective coping mechanisms,&quot; Einbinder says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With medication and therapy, he is doing much better now. Einbinder hopes that sharing his experiences will help people understand that if they're dealing with depression and anger, &quot;they're not alone and there's loads of resources out there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cheap Chinese electric cars are coming to the US and Europe</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1541380/the-cheapest-chinese-electric-cars-are-coming-to-the-us-and-europe/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1541380/the-cheapest-chinese-electric-cars-are-coming-to-the-us-and-europe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;China already sells more electric vehicles than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1489228/beyond-the-tesla-bubble-the-future-of-electric-cars-is-being-scripted-in-china/&quot;&gt;rest of the world combined&lt;/a&gt;. And there’s a long list of the categories you can choose from—including large buses, sports cars, two-wheeled motorcycles, and zippy scooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;One of the hottest categories in that list is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-giant-market-for-tiny-cars-1537538585&quot;&gt;tiny cars&lt;/a&gt;.” These mini-vehicles can cost as little as $1,000 and, in China at least, you don’t even need a driver’s license to use them. The catch? Their top speed is less than 40 miles per hour, they run on cheap lead-acid batteries, and they have little to no crash protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;That’s not much of a concern for Chinese users, who are buying these low-speed electric vehicles (LSEVs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1495191/to-master-electric-car-manufacturing-china-started-with-bikes/&quot;&gt;like hot cakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atlas-embed atlas-chart&quot; data-id=&quot;B1v3ADrVE&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;400&quot; role=&quot;text&quot; aria-label=&quot;Embedded chart from TheAtlas.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_B1v3ADrVE.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Four-year-old electric vehicle maker Kaiyun Motors thinks that it can tempt Americans and Europeans to buy into the craze. “Mini-electric vehicles are more than enough to meet consumers’ daily needs,” Wang Chao, founder of Kaiyun, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-24/a-5-000-electric-pickup-truck-from-china-wants-to-enter-u-s&quot;&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; (paywall). &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;There is a huge market out there around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Kaiyun will start selling its “Pickman” electric pickup in the US, Germany, and Italy as soon as next month.  The base Chinese model sells for 16,800 yuan ($2,500). The US version will start at $8,950, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/auto/new-half-ton-electric-pickup-costs-just-5700&quot;&gt;Fox News reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;These are not snazzy, high-end vehicles, and their marketing isn’t either. A promotional video for the Pickman features a young, hoodie-wearing Chinese narrator plainly explaining the car’s unique features. The pickup comes in six colors, boasts off-road capability, and can fit a “family of three,” according to the video. It has a range of 120 km (75 miles) on a single charge. The battery takes up to ten hours to charge. The Pickman’s top speed is 45 km per hour (28 miles per hour), and it has a payload capacity of 450 kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;For comparison, top-end electric cars like Tesla Model S can go for more than 480 km (300 miles) on a single charge, can fast charge lithium-ion batteries to 100% in 75 mins, and boast top speeds of 240 km per hour (150 miles per hour). The top model costs more than $90,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;And if we compare within Pickman’s category, the gasoline version of the Ford F-150 pickup starts at $28,000 and its upcoming electric version is rumored to start at $70,000. The Pickman can’t do everything that a Ford F-150 can do—such as travel at a top speed of 160 km per hour (100 miles per hour) and carry a payload as much as 1,000 kg. But it still has potential for use on farms or construction sites, where the car can be used in the day and put to charge at night at a lower cost than a gas-guzzling truck.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox 66 to block automatically playing audible video and audio</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/firefox-66-to-block-automatically-playing-audible-video-and-audio/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/firefox-66-to-block-automatically-playing-audible-video-and-audio/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it annoying when you click on a link or open a new browser tab and audible video or audio starts playing automatically?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that unsolicited volume can be a great source of distraction and frustration for users of the web. So we are making changes to how Firefox handles playing media with sound. We want to make sure web developers are aware of this new &lt;em&gt;autoplay blocking&lt;/em&gt; feature in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the release of Firefox 66 for desktop and Firefox for Android, Firefox will block audible audio and video by default. We only allow a site to play audio or video aloud via the &lt;code&gt;HTMLMediaElement&lt;/code&gt; API once a web page has had user interaction to initiate the audio, such as the user clicking on a “play” button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any playback that happens before the user has interacted with a page via a mouse click, printable key press, or touch event, is deemed to be &lt;em&gt;autoplay&lt;/em&gt; and will be blocked if it is potentially audible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muted autoplay is still allowed. So script can set the “muted” attribute on &lt;code&gt;HTMLMediaElement&lt;/code&gt; to true, and autoplay will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to roll out audible autoplay blocking enabled by default, in Firefox 66, scheduled for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox#Firefox_channels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;general release&lt;/a&gt; on 19 March 2019. In Firefox for Android, this will replace the existing block autoplay implementation with the same behavior we’ll be using in Firefox on desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some sites on which users want audible autoplay audio and video to be allowed. When Firefox for Desktop blocks autoplay audio or video, an icon appears in the URL bar. Users can click on the icon to access the site information panel, where they can change the “Autoplay sound” permission for that site from the default setting of “Block” to “Allow”. Firefox will then allow that site to autoplay audibly. This allows users to easily curate their own whitelist of sites that they trust to autoplay audibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/01/doorhanger1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-33155 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/01/doorhanger1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;512&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox expresses a blocked &lt;code&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt; call to JavaScript by rejecting the promise returned by &lt;code&gt;HTMLMediaElement.play()&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;NotAllowedError&lt;/code&gt;. All major browsers which block autoplay express a blocked play via this mechanism. In general, the advice for web authors when calling &lt;code&gt;HTMLMediaElement.play()&lt;/code&gt;, is to &lt;em&gt;not assume&lt;/em&gt; that calls to &lt;code&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt; will always succeed, and to always handle the promise returned by &lt;code&gt;play()&lt;/code&gt; being rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to avoid having your audible playback blocked, you should only play media inside a click or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;keyboard event&lt;/a&gt; handler, or on mobile in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/touchend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;touchend event&lt;/a&gt;. Another strategy to consider for video is to autoplay muted, and present an “unmute” button to your users. Note that muted autoplay is also currently allowed by default in all major browsers which block autoplay media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also allowing sites to autoplay audibly if the user has previously granted them camera/microphone permission, so that sites which have explicit user permission to run WebRTC should continue to work as they do today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, we’re also working on blocking autoplay for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Web Audio&lt;/a&gt; content, but have not yet finalized our implementation. We expect to ship with autoplay Web Audio content blocking enabled by default sometime in 2019. We’ll let you know!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Has Quietly Dropped Ban on Personally Identifiable Web Tracking (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When Google bought the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin said that privacy would be the company’s “number one priority when we contemplate new kinds of advertising products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick’s massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand – literally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/archive/20160325-20160628/&quot;&gt;crossing out the lines&lt;/a&gt; in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits “may be” combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change is enabled by default for new Google accounts. Existing users were prompted to opt-in to the change this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is a sea change for Google and a further blow to the online ad industry’s longstanding contention that web tracking is mostly anonymous. In recent years, Facebook, offline data brokers and others have increasingly sought to combine their troves of web tracking data with people’s real names. But until this summer, Google held the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that DoubleClick data wasn’t being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand,” said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy,” he said. “That wall has just fallen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville emailed a statement describing Google’s change in privacy policy as an update to adjust to the “smartphone revolution”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” Faville wrote. She added that the change “is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3145771-Google-Statement.html&quot;&gt;Read Google’s entire statement&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing Google users were prompted to opt-into the new tracking this summer through a request with titles such as “Some new features for your Google account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “new features” received little scrutiny at the time. Wired wrote that it “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/06/latest-ad-tracking-move-google-gets-opt-right/&quot;&gt;gives you more granular control&lt;/a&gt; over how ads work across devices.” In a personal tech column, the New York Times also described the change as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/technology/personaltech/changing-your-google-account-settings.html&quot;&gt;new controls&lt;/a&gt; for the types of advertisements you see around the web.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting web browsing habits to personally identifiable information has long been controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy advocates raised a ruckus in 1999 when DoubleClick purchased a data broker that assembled people’s names, addresses and offline interests. The merger could have allowed DoubleClick to combine its web browsing information with people’s names. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/closing_letters/doubleclick-inc./doubleclick.pdf&quot;&gt;an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;, DoubleClick sold the broker at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the controversy, the nascent online advertising industry formed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.networkadvertising.org/&quot;&gt;Network Advertising Initiative&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 to establish ethical codes. The industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2000/07/federal-trade-commission-issues-report-online-profiling&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; to provide consumers with notice when their data was being collected, and options to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most online ad tracking remained essentially anonymous for some time after that. When Google bought DoubleClick in 2007, for instance, the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20060901003537/http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/dart_adserving.asp&quot;&gt;privacy policy stated&lt;/a&gt;: “DoubleClick’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Google changed its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services - such as Gmail and search. But it kept data from DoubleClick – whose tracking technology is enabled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/#data&quot;&gt;half of the top 1 million&lt;/a&gt; websites – separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the era of social networking has ushered in a new wave of identifiable tracking, in which services such as Facebook and Twitter have been able to track logged-in users when they shared an item from another website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Facebook announced that it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/its-complicated-facebooks-history-of-tracking-you&quot;&gt;track its users by name across the Internet&lt;/a&gt; when they visit websites containing Facebook buttons such as “Share” and “Like” – even when users don’t click on the button. (Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads&quot;&gt;how you can opt&lt;/a&gt; out of the targeted ads generated by that tracking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline data brokers also started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/why-online-tracking-is-getting-creepier&quot;&gt;merge their mailing lists with online shoppers&lt;/a&gt;. “The marriage of online and offline is the ad targeting of the last 10 years on steroids,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.liveramp.com/2014/03/07/rampup-2014-data-convergence-mobile-display/#COOAOD&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Scott Howe, chief executive of broker firm Acxiom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To opt-out of Google’s identified tracking, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols&quot;&gt;Activity controls&lt;/a&gt; on Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://myaccount.google.com/&quot;&gt;My Account page&lt;/a&gt;, and uncheck the box next to “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services.&quot; You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/465&quot;&gt;delete past activity&lt;/a&gt; from your account.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla Raises Concerns Over Facebook’s Lack of Transparency</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/01/31/mozilla-raises-concerns-over-facebooks-lack-of-transparency/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/01/31/mozilla-raises-concerns-over-facebooks-lack-of-transparency/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today Denelle Dixon, Mozilla’s Chief Operating Officer, sent a letter to the European Commission surfacing concerns about the lack of publicly available data for political advertising on the Facebook platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has come to our attention that Facebook has prevented third parties from conducting analysis of the ads on their platform. This impacts our ability to deliver transparency to EU citizens ahead of the EU elections. It also prevents any developer, researcher, or organization to develop tools, critical insights, and research designed to educate and empower users to understand and therefore resist targeted disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla strongly believes that transparency cannot just be on the terms with which the world’s largest, most powerful tech companies are most comfortable. To have true transparency in this space, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/introducing-the-ad-archive-api/&quot;&gt;Ad Archive API&lt;/a&gt; needs to be publicly available to everyone. This is all the more critical now that third party transparency tools have been blocked. We appreciate the work that Facebook has already done to counter the spread of disinformation, and we hope that it will fulfill its promises made under the Commission’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/code-practice-disinformation&quot;&gt;Code of Practice&lt;/a&gt; and deliver transparency to EU citizens ahead of the EU Parliamentary elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mozilla-letter-to-EU-Commission-on-Facebook-transparency-31-01-19-1.pdf&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s letter to European Commission on Facebook Transparency 31 01 19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
