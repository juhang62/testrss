<title>Its butterfly keyboard design has failed, but Apple has yet to admit its mistake</title>
<link>https://theoutline.com/post/7315/apple-keyboards-still-suck-insanely-bad?zd=1&amp;zi=qklqjspx</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theoutline.com/post/7315/apple-keyboards-still-suck-insanely-bad?zd=1&amp;zi=qklqjspx</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, in a discussion about Apple’s terrible butterfly keyboard design with a source who wished not to be identified and who definitely does not work for Apple, they noted I had bought a 2017 MacBook Pro and gotten rid of it after a little more than a year due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=cseimgyt&quot;&gt;the now-notorious problems they have&lt;/a&gt; with something as simple as “a piece of dust” causing stuck or dead keys. “So, just curious, why did you buy another one?” she asked, referring to the 2018 MacBook Air I’d gotten six months after selling the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have an answer ready, but was impressed that she asked, because I felt largely like an idiot who deserved it. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/4277/dont-buy-the-new-macbook-pros-even-on-sale-in-my-opinion&quot;&gt;selling back&lt;/a&gt; my MacBook Pro &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/20/apple-mac-trade-in-partner-phobio/&quot;&gt;to Apple&lt;/a&gt; for about two-thirds of what I paid, my 2013 MacBook Pro (which I kept around even after buying the new Pro; yes, I have a lot of computers) that I returned to using started to show signs of age. It stopped recognizing its battery, even as the keyboard still worked flawlessly. I cast around to every other possible laptop solution — Chromebooks, Windows laptops, a Surface — before deciding I was too married to the Apple ecosystem to leave it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pettier side of me felt I couldn’t sit by and watch Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2018/07/19/apple-confirms-2018-mbp-keyboard-prevents-debris/&quot;&gt;claim to have fixed a problem&lt;/a&gt; I sensed it had not substantially addressed at all. It wasn’t enough to read about it; I had to go back in and continue to personally suffer the badness of their cursed keyboard design in order to live out a kind of truth, even if it meant certain annoyance and a waste of my money and time. Fueled by equal parts irrational hope I knew I shouldn’t trust and deep skepticism to which I should have listened, I bought the 2018 MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, a couple months into owning this computer, the keys started to act up. As before, problems would come and go; the E or B key would be unresponsive for a day or so before whatever was jamming them up mysteriously went away. The spacebar was the worst offender. For a long while it doubled spaces from a single keypress, but only sometimes. Finally, it seemed to get something lodged under it big or annoying enough that it couldn’t shake itself loose, and I had to pound it to get a space out of it; for two days, my sentencescame outlikethis. I made a Genius Bar appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After verifying my problem, the Genius issued her judgment: “So the keyboard on this computer is very sensitive,” she said. “And when debris goes underneath the keyboard, it can become unresponsive. So I’m just going to clean it out, I’m going to take it to the back and blow air in it and we’ll see if it gets better. Ok?” Apple’s suggested fix of cleaning its easily fallible keyboard with canned air theoretically doesn’t require any special equipment or put the computer in a sensitive position, it’s not clear why Apple’s service people aren’t allowed to just do it out in the open. The Genius took it away, and a few minutes later brought it back, demonstrating its now-functional spacebar and slightly more responsive keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It took 1hr+ on the phone to arrange a MacBook Pro keyboard repair (purchased from Apple with AppleCare).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they say “We’re aware that a small number of users are having issues...” with Mac keyboards, that smacks of knowing minimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s HARD to report and get fixed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ETXQng6QDE&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ETXQng6QDE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1. “Apple never does X” rarely precludes them from doing something. They often surprise us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. I don’t think they’ve ever had a product flaw of the magnitude and severity of the butterfly keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have ample motivation to correct this years-long mistake. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7cEfQrJw3z&quot;&gt;https://t.co/7cEfQrJw3z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1115329327443390465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 8, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her how she cleans out the keyboards when people bring them in. She positioned the monitor at a right angle and stood up the computer on its side, and mimed a back-and-forth sweeping spraying motion from the left side (now top end) of the keyboard down to the right (now bottom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does Apple sell canned air? No, she said; she recommended Best Buy or Staples. She told me not to eat over the computer, watching me for a reaction to this somehow insanely unrealistic yet also eminently reasonable prospect. No one aims to take meals over their computer; I’d go as far to say no one ever does it except out of necessity. And when that necessity arises, it doesn’t seem like an unreasonable ask that the computer would be able to tolerate a few crumbs being scattered on it. But I suppose I am in the wrong for expecting my $1,600 computer to be able to cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear at this point that I am extremely not alone in having this problem; developer Marco Arment &lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2017/11/24/fixing-the-macbook-pro&quot;&gt;has written&lt;/a&gt; extensively about it, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; Joanna Stern recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/graphics/apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-macbook-keyboard-problem/&quot;&gt;wrote an entire column&lt;/a&gt; with authentically dropped e’s and r’s that were the result of her new (broken) MacBook Air keyboard. (Stern, notably, actually managed to get a real apology out of the company, unlike me. But Apple has yet to match those words with tangible action, like, for instance, making notebooks with working keyboards and offering them as replacements to all of the people who unwittingly bought computers that were bound to break.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote a few months ago, the latest redesigns of the butterfly keyboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/6409/the-new-and-improved-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=ekk2cqad&quot;&gt;have failed to address the responsiveness problems&lt;/a&gt;; posts from Apple customers on support forums about dead or repeating keys have kept up at a very steady pace. What’s changed is that Apple has lured &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-macbook-air-review-your-next-laptop-has-arrived-three-years-late-1541502000&quot;&gt;a whole generation of loyal MacBook Air fans, like Stern&lt;/a&gt;, into subjecting themselves to this hamstrung version of a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Genius claimed that if this incident occurred multiple times, I might be eligible for a full top-case replacement, like I got with the first computer that had this problem back in September 2017. She gamely checked the replacement program page to see if the MacBook Air was listed as eligible (it is not; the model is less than a year old and so covered by Apple’s standard warranty). But she avowed that the Airs seemed prone to the same issues as all the other computers that were now covered, and would likely be added to the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.4237288135593&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What year is yours? I’m still happy as a clam with my 2014 MBP. But I’d have upgraded last year if not for the keyboard concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
— John Gruber (@gruber) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1100554184540213248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 27, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.5454545454545&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’m really hoping my 11-inch MacBook Air lasts long enough for Apple to fix all of its keyboards. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/oHuxaM7hV3&quot;&gt;https://t.co/oHuxaM7hV3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Dan Moren (@dmoren) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmoren/status/1100553448511234048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 27, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple made its reputation on support; the Genius Bar, at which customers could get in-person help right in any of the retail stores was in stark contrast to 15 years ago, when the best help you could get for any Windows computer was a tech-support phone line staffed by remote call centers. Even then, that setup was meant to deal more with hardware problems and not, say, viruses or corrupt software. Apple Geniuses, by contrast, handled everything seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, and Apple appears to be buckling a little under the weight of its operation. The Genius appointment-making page has slowly evolved from pointing people directly to in-person appointments to encouraging phone or remote support. A couple of years ago, it started offering support appointments with third-party service providers through the same interface that it offers ones with the Genius Bar, an endorsement of operations outside its normally airtight vertical integration I couldn’t have even imagined 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple still claims that only a “small percentage” of people experience trouble with their keyboards. But having now heard the idea of a “sensitive” keyboard, I’m not sure I will ever get over it. No one has had to think this hard about keyboards in decades, at least before Apple went in and messed with them. Now the complaints are reaching critical mass and I have Microsoft emailing me offering to fly me out to its Redmond campus so it can walk me through its “seven elements that every keyboard needs to create a great typing experience.” I have a hard time imagining what those seven elements are, because I get stuck at two: 1. Produces the characters 2. That I intended to type. These two attributes are also, incidentally, what the biggest and most-valuable tech companies in the world are somehow grappling with anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;9.5138888888889&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Maybe it’s because I am getting old and cranky, but my late model Apple phone and laptop are harder to use, less efficient, less fun— inferior products compared to earlier versions. (Except for the camera.) For me Apple is going backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
— Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1117221529606082560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of fairness, the Genius-sanctioned canned-air cleaning worked, at least for now. It would likely not resolve the problem of debris that is actually stuck, or broken plastic pieces inside the assembly. But I dread the Overton window shift that Apple now appears to be attempting to push, which is that its customers and their crumbs and dust and bad habits are to blame, and should bend themselves around the “sensitive” keyboard, keep canned air (not supplied by Apple itself) on hand at all times, as if this is a problem we’ve always had, and not one Apple singlehandedly created with a nearsighted design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am stupid for buying another one of these computers, but only as stupid as any of us are for learning to love these dumb tech products on their merits, becoming beholden to the system, and then having a big commitment out of which to dig ourselves (actually not very stupid at all). I’m far more inclined to subscribe to a different argument, which is that Apple is the stupid one for not only trying to reinvent a solution to the extremely solved problem of how to make a working keyboard, but continuing to pretend that, four years and four iterations later, it hasn’t utterly failed. The company declined to comment on the record for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Instagram hides Like counts in leaked design prototype</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/instagram-no-like-counter/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/instagram-no-like-counter/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;“We want your followers to focus on what you share, not how many likes your posts get. During this test, only the person who share a post will see the total number of likes it gets.” That’s how &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;instagram&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; describes a seemingly small design change test with massive potential impact on users’ well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding Like counts could reduce herd mentality, where people just Like what’s already got tons of Likes. &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/jane-manchun-wong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;jane-manchun-wong&quot;&gt;It&lt;/a&gt; could reduce the sense of competition on Instagram, since users won’t compare their own counts with those of more popular friends or superstar creators. And it could encourage creators to post what feels most authentic rather than trying to rack of Likes for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout size-full wp-image-1814711 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ig-hide-like-count.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;674&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ig-hide-like-count.png 3240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ig-hide-like-count.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ig-hide-like-count.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ig-hide-like-count.png?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ig-hide-like-count.png?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ig-hide-like-count.png?resize=50,33 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design change test was spotted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1118970853654290432&quot;&gt;Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, the prolific reverse engineering expert and frequent TechCrunch tipster whose spotted tons of Instagram features before they’re officially confirmed or launched. Wong discovered the design change test in Instagram’s Android code and was able to generate the screenshots above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see on the left that the Instagram feed post lacks a Like count, but still shows a few faces and a name of other people who’ve Liked it. Users are alerted that only they’ll see their post’s Like counts, and anyone else won’t. Many users delete posts that don’t immediately get ‘enough’ Likes or post to their fake ‘Finstagram’ accounts if they don’t think they’ll be proud of the hearts they collect. Hiding Like counts might get users posting more since they’ll be less self-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Instagram confirmed to TechCrunch that this design is an internal prototype that’s not visible to the public yet. A spokesperson told us: “We’re not testing this at the moment, but exploring ways to reduce pressure on Instagram is something we’re always thinking about.” Other features we’ve reported on in the same phase, such as video calling, soundtracks for Stories, and the app’s time well spent dashboard all went on to receive official launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Wong has also recently spotted several other Instagram prototypes lurking in its Android code. Those include &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1118983262834049024&quot;&gt;chat thread stickers for Direct messages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1118519762340810752&quot;&gt;augmented reality filters for Direct Video calls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/instagram-watch-party/&quot;&gt;simultaneous co-watching&lt;/a&gt; of recommended videos through Direct, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1118955819876249601&quot;&gt;karaoke-style lyrics&lt;/a&gt; that appear synced to soundtracks in Stories, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1117142922745352192&quot;&gt;emoji reactions to feed posts&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1113512183395000321&quot;&gt;shopping bag&lt;/a&gt; for commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that there’s no plan to hide follower counts on user profiles, which are the true measure of popularity but also serve a purpose of distinguishing great content creators and assessing their worth to marketers. Hiding Likes could just put more of a spotlight on follower and comment counts. And even if users don’t see Like counts, they still massively impact the feed’s ranking algorithm, so creators will still have to battle for them to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1814740&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-1814740&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1814740 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Instagram-No-Like-Number-Close-Up.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;716&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Instagram-No-Like-Number-Close-Up.png 716w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Instagram-No-Like-Number-Close-Up.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Instagram-No-Like-Number-Close-Up.png?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Instagram-No-Like-Number-Close-Up.png?resize=680,274 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Instagram-No-Like-Number-Close-Up.png?resize=50,20 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1814740&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Close-up of Instagram’s design for feed posts without Like counters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change matches a growing belief that Like counts can be counter-productive or even harmful to users’ psyches. Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom told me back in 2016 that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/instagram-stories/&quot;&gt;getting away from the pressure of Like counts was one impetus for Instagram launching Stories&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, Twitter began testing a design which hides retweet counts behind an extra tap to similarly discourage inauthentic competition and herd mentality. And Snapchat has never shown Like counts or even follower counts, which has made it feel less stressful but also less useful for influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narcissism, envy spiraling, and low self-image can all stem from staring at Like counts. They’re a constant reminder of the status hierarchies that have emerged from social networks. For many users, at some point it stopped being fun and started to feel more like working in the heart mines. If Instagram rolls the feature out, it could put the emphasis back on sharing art and self-expression, not trying to win some popularity contest.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Instagram hides Like counts in leaked design prototype</og:title>
<og:description>“We want your followers to focus on what you share, not how many likes your posts get. During this test, only the person who share a post will see the total number of likes it gets.” That’s how Instagram describes a seemingly small design change test with massive potential impact …</og:description>

<title>Mozilla WebThings</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/introducing-mozilla-webthings/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla IoT team is excited to announce that after two years of development and seven quarterly software updates that have generated significant interest from the developer &amp;amp; maker community, Project Things is graduating from its early experimental phase and from now on will be known as Mozilla WebThings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-33421 alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/mozilla_webthings_wordmark.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;126&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/mozilla_webthings_wordmark.png 501w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/mozilla_webthings_wordmark-250x84.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/mozilla_webthings_wordmark-500x168.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/mission/&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;em&gt;“ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla IoT&lt;/a&gt; team’s mission is to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Things&quot;&gt;Web of Things&lt;/a&gt; implementation which embodies those values and helps drive IoT standards for security, privacy and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Mozilla WebThings&lt;/a&gt; is an open platform for monitoring and controlling devices over the web, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway&quot;&gt;WebThings Gateway&lt;/a&gt; – a software distribution for smart home gateways focused on privacy, security and interoperability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org/framework&quot;&gt;WebThings Framework&lt;/a&gt; – a collection of reusable software components to help developers build their own web things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/webthings_gateway_main_menu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33423&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/webthings_gateway_main_menu.png&quot; alt=&quot;WebThings Gateway UI&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/webthings_gateway_main_menu.png 800w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/webthings_gateway_main_menu-250x150.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/webthings_gateway_main_menu-768x461.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/webthings_gateway_main_menu-500x300.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to a future in which Mozilla WebThings software is installed on commercial products that can provide consumers with a trusted agent for their “smart”, connected home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WebThings Gateway 0.8 release is available to download from today. If you have an existing Things Gateway it should have automatically updated itself. This latest release includes new features which allow you to privately log data from all your smart home devices, a new alarms capability and a new network settings UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to know how many times the door was opened and closed while you were out? Are you curious about energy consumption of appliances plugged into your smart plugs? With the new logs features you can privately log data from all your smart home devices and visualise that data using interactive graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/logging.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33420&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/logging.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logs UI&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/logging.png 1024w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/logging-250x166.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/logging-768x510.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/logging-500x332.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to enable the new logging features go to the main menu ➡ Settings ➡ Experiments and enable the “Logs” option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/experiment_settings.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33419&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/experiment_settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Experiment Settings&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/experiment_settings.png 800w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/experiment_settings-250x150.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/experiment_settings-768x461.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/experiment_settings-500x300.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll then see the Logs option in the main menu. From there you can click the “+” button to choose a device property to log, including how long to retain the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/add_log.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33418&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/add_log.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add log UI&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/add_log.png 800w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/add_log-250x150.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/add_log-768x461.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/add_log-500x300.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time series plots can be viewed by hour, day, or week, and a scroll bar lets users scroll back through time. This feature is still experimental, but viewing these logs will help you understand the kinds of data your smart home devices are collecting and think about how much of that data you are comfortable sharing with others via third party services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If booting WebThings Gateway from an SD card on a Raspberry Pi, please be aware that logging large amounts of data to the SD card may make the card wear out more quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alarms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home safety and security are among the big potential benefits of smart home systems. If one of your “dumb” alarms is triggered while you are at work, how will you know? Even if someone in the vicinity hears it, will they take action? Do they know who to call? WebThings Gateway 0.8 provides a new alarms capability for devices like smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms or burglar alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/alarm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft wp-image-33424&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/alarm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alarm Capability&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/alarm.png 800w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/alarm-250x150.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/alarm-768x461.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/alarm-500x300.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can now check whether an alarm is currently active, and configure rules to notify you if an alarm is triggered while you’re away from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Network Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous releases, moving your gateway from one wireless network to another when the previous Wi-Fi access point was still active could not be done without console access and command line changes directly on the Raspberry Pi. With the 0.8 release, it is now possible to re-configure your gateway’s network settings from the web interface. These new settings can be found under Settings ➡ Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/network_settings-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33427&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/network_settings-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Network Settings UI&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/network_settings-1.png 800w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/network_settings-1-250x150.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/network_settings-1-768x461.png 768w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/network_settings-1-500x300.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can either configure the Ethernet port (with a dynamic or static IP address) or re-scan available wireless networks and change the Wi-Fi access point that the gateway is connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also excited to share that we’ve been working on a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://openwrt.org/&quot;&gt;OpenWrt&lt;/a&gt;-based build of WebThings Gateway, aimed at consumer wireless routers. This version of WebThings Gateway will be able to act as a wifi access point itself, rather than just connect to an existing wireless network as a client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/gateway.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-33425&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/gateway.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;306&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/gateway.png 651w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/gateway-250x188.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/gateway-500x376.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of a new phase of development of our gateway software, as it evolves into a software distribution for consumer wireless routers. Look out for further announcements in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with a refresh of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;Mozilla IoT website&lt;/a&gt;, we have made a start on some online user &amp;amp; developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org/docs/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; for the WebThings Gateway and WebThings Framework. If you’d like to contribute to this documentation you can do so via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla-iot/docs/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all the contributions we’ve received so far from our wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.mozilla.org/community&quot;&gt;Mozilla IoT community&lt;/a&gt;. We look forward to this new and exciting phase of the project!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Super Mario Bros. has been released for the Commodore 64</title>
<link>https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=71262</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=71262</guid>
<description>DESCRIPTION&lt;p&gt;This is a Commodore 64 port of the 1985 game SUPER MARIO BROS. for the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System. It contains the original version that was released in Japan and United States, as well as the European version. It also detects and supports a handful of turbo functionalities, and has 2 SID support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disk-image contains 2 programs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUPER M. BROS.64 - the game (everything in one file)&lt;br/&gt;SMB.64 DOCS - this manual&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cartridge-file is also provided. It only contains the game and can be used with a C64GS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VSP (VARIABLE SCREEN POSITIONING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This port relies on the VSP-technique for scrolling. If you experience crashes while playing the game, this is most likely the issue. You may find out if your computer is prone to crashing by running VSP Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://csdb.dk/release/?id=120810&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://csdb.dk/release/?id=120810&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, there are a number of things to try (some options cheaper than others):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Try another C64.&lt;br/&gt;- Use an emulator instead.&lt;br/&gt;- Use a C64 Reloaded motherboard - they are designed to be VSP-safe.&lt;br/&gt;- Use a Turbo Chameleon - because of how it works, VSP glitches will not alter the Chameleons memory, thus preventing the game from crashing. This port will also benefit from its turbo functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPTION MENU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the game starts, an option menu will let you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- select a version of the game.&lt;br/&gt;- disable turbo (if detected).&lt;br/&gt;- configure a second SID-chip.&lt;br/&gt;- see the background (based on Shigeru Miyamotos artwork that was used for the Japanese and European release).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The option menu is (just like this manual) controlled using a joystick (or gamepad) in either control port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of these options will now be described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VERSIONS AND TIMING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original game was released in two versions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Japanese/US-release - the original for NTSC, 60 Hz video systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- European-release - adjusted for PAL, 50 Hz video systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This port will try to run the game at the intended speed (as well as having the sound in the correct pitch); this means you can play either version on any type of C64. It also means that the Japanese/US-release will not play 20% slower on a PAL-system. Likewise, the European-release will not play 20% faster on an NTSC-system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program will automatically detect your hardware (including any turbo functionality). Based on this, it will suggest the best version for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind the suggested version is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- If you play on a stock C64 (PAL, Drean or any NTSC) without any turbo functionality, the European-release will give you the least slowdowns, since the original game-engine is tuned for a 50 Hz refresh-rate which uses less CPU-cycles per second than the original Japanese/US-release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- If turbo functionality is detected, the version aimed for your video-system will give you the smoothest scrolling. This means: Japanese/US-release on any NTSC C64, European-release on PAL and Drean C64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can override the suggested version, if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPATIBILITY AND TURBO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VSP issues aside, this port should be able to run on all regional C64 models. PAL, NTSC (new and old) and Drean (PAL-N) are all supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the NES-processor is clocked (roughly 70%) faster than a stock C64 there can be slowdowns during gameplay. A pixel indicates this on the time-watch graphics in the status bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This port will try to detect and use any kind of turbo functionality, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Commodore 128 (2 MHz in the border)&lt;br/&gt;- C64 DTV&lt;br/&gt;- Schnedler Systems Turbo Master CPU (untested)&lt;br/&gt;- Swisscomp Turbo Processor (untested)&lt;br/&gt;- Rossmoeller Flash 8 (untested)&lt;br/&gt;- CMD SuperCPU Accelerator (untested)&lt;br/&gt;- Icomp Turbo Chameleon 64&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can disable the detected turbo functionality if you experience problems with it enabled (or wish to see how the game performs without it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 SID SUPPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- This port emulates 4 channels of the NES APU (audio processing unit): 2 pulse channels, 1 triangle channel and 1 noise channel. The SID-chip has 3 voices, so this is handled by sharing 1 SID-voice for the triangle and noise channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- If a second SID-chip is configured, the program will instead dedicate 2 APU-channels to each SID-chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the option menu you are able to configure and test your SID-setup. You can use the following addresses for the second SID-chip: $D420, $D500, $DE00 and $DF00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the test you should be able to hear 2 tones being played simultaneously for 2 seconds. The first tone has a lower pitch and fades out. The second tone has a higher pitch and fades in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- If a second SID-chip has been configured, the higher pitched tone should be playing on that SID, otherwise they will both be playing on the first SID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONTROLLERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is controlled using joystick (or gamepad) in either control port and supports 2 button joysticks (using POT X, like the C64GS joystick).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joystick used to start a game will control Mario. If a 2 player game is selected, the other joystick will control Luigi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can press F1 or F3 to toggle between the 4 modes for control port 1 or 2 respectively. A message on the screen will display what mode you have selected. These modes are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mode 1 - Up &amp;gt; Jump (Default)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mode 2 - Up &amp;gt; Jump, buttons swapped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mode 3 - Standard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mode 4 - Standard, buttons swapped&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mapping scheme is by default setup for 1 button joysticks, where pushing up will trigger jumping (and swimming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the C64, this is the most common way to control your character in platform games. Examples: Bubble Bobble, The Great Giana Sisters, Mayhem in Monsterland, Turrican, Wonder Boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a joystick which supports 2 individual buttons, the second button will also trigger jumping (and swimming) in mode 1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the physical layout of your joystick, you can change the control scheme to swap the action of the buttons (mode 2 and 4) so that they correspond physically with a NES-controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference of a NES-controller:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The A-button (placed to the right) is jump (and swim)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The B-button (placed to the left) is throw fireballs (and accelerate)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2 button joysticks it is also possible to use mode 3 and 4 which disables the UP &amp;gt; Jump-mapping. Do not use these modes on 1 button joysticks as you will not be able to either jump or throw fireballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEY DESCRIPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;- - Exit to title-screen (during a game)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RUN/STOP - Pause game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;F1 - Toggle joystick mode for control port 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;F3 - Toggle joystick mode for control port 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;F5 - Decrease SID volume (on some 6581 SID-chips the audio can sound distorted on the highest volume)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;F7 - Increase SID volume&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h4&gt;Tesla Autopilot Crash: Why We Should Worry About a Single Death&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of the crash site showing engine.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI3NzY2Mg.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photo: Jemal Countess/Getty Images This is part of the wreckage of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302, a Boeing 737 Max airliner that crashed on 11 March in Bishoftu, Ethiopia, killing all 157 passengers and crew.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have been a pilot&lt;/strong&gt; for 30 years, a software developer for more than 40. I have written extensively about both aviation and software engineering. Now it’s time for me to write about both together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boeing 737 Max has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/boeing-737-max-deliveries/index.html&quot;&gt;been in the news&lt;/a&gt; because of two crashes, practically back to back and involving brand new airplanes. In an industry that relies more than anything on the appearance of total control, total safety, these two crashes pose as close to an existential risk as you can get. Though airliner passenger death rates have fallen over the decades, that achievement is no reason for complacency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 737 first appeared in 1967, when I was 3 years old. Back then it was a smallish aircraft with smallish engines and relatively simple systems. Airlines (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2012/06/18/the-secrets-of-southwests-continued-success&quot;&gt;especially Southwest&lt;/a&gt;) loved it because of its simplicity, reliability, and flexibility. Not to mention the fact that it could be flown by a two-person cockpit crew—as opposed to the three or four of previous airliners—which made it a significant cost saver. Over the years, market and technological forces pushed the 737 into ever-larger versions with increasing electronic and mechanical complexity. This is not, by any means, unique to the 737. Airliners constitute enormous capital investments both for the industries that make them and the customers who buy them, and they all go through a similar growth process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of those market and technical forces are on the side of economics, not safety. They work as allies to relentlessly drive down what the industry calls “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/casm.asp&quot;&gt;seat-mile costs&lt;/a&gt;”—the cost of flying a seat from one point to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much had to do with the engines themselves. The principle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/carnot.html&quot;&gt;Carnot efficiency&lt;/a&gt; dictates that the larger and hotter you can make any heat engine, the more efficient it becomes. That’s as true for jet engines as it is for chainsaw engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as that. The most effective way to make an engine use less fuel per unit of power produced is to make it larger. That’s why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycoming_O-360&quot;&gt;Lycoming O-360 engine&lt;/a&gt; in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://cessna.txtav.com/&quot;&gt;Cessna&lt;/a&gt; has pistons the size of dinner plates. That’s why marine diesel engines stand three stories tall. And that’s why Boeing wanted to put the huge CFM International LEAP engine in its latest version of the 737.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was just one little problem: The original 737 had (by today’s standards) tiny little engines, which easily cleared the ground beneath the wings. As the 737 grew and was fitted with bigger engines, the clearance between the engines and the ground started to get a little…um, tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;zoom&quot; href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI3ODE4Mg.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration showing the Boeing 737 airliner.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI3ODE4Mg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;magnifier&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustration: Norebbo.com By substituting a larger engine, Boeing changed the intrinsic aerodynamic nature of the 737 airliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various hacks (as we would call them in the software industry) were developed. One of the most noticeable to the public was changing the shape of the engine intakes from circular to oval, the better to clear the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the 737 Max, the situation became critical. The engines on the original 737 had a fan diameter (that of the intake blades on the engine) of just 100 centimeters (40 inches); those planned for the 737 Max have 176 cm. That’s a centerline difference of well over  30 cm (a foot), and you couldn’t “ovalize” the  intake enough to hang the new engines beneath  the wing without scraping the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution was to extend the engine up and well in front of the wing. However, doing so also meant that the centerline of the engine’s thrust changed. Now, when the pilots applied power to the engine, the aircraft would have a significant propensity to “pitch up,” or raise its nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angle of attack is the angle between the wings and the airflow over the wings. Think of sticking your hand out of a car window on the highway. If your hand is level, you have a low angle of attack; if your hand is pitched up, you have a high angle of attack. When the angle of attack is great enough, the wing enters what’s called an aerodynamic stall. You can feel the same thing with your hand out the window: As you rotate your hand, your arm wants to move up like a wing more and more until you stall your hand, at which point your arm wants to flop down on the car door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This propensity to pitch up with power application thereby increased the risk that the airplane could stall when the pilots “punched it” (as my son likes to say). It’s particularly likely to happen if the airplane is flying slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still, because the engine nacelles were so far in front of the wing and so large, a power increase will cause them to actually produce lift, particularly at high angles of attack. So the nacelles make a bad problem worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll say it again: In the 737 Max, the engine nacelles themselves can, at high angles of attack, work as a wing and produce lift. And the lift they produce is well ahead of the wing’s center of lift, meaning the nacelles will cause the 737 Max at a high angle of attack to go to a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; angle of attack. This is aerodynamic malpractice of the worst kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitch changes with power changes are common in aircraft. Even my little Cessna pitches up a bit when power is applied. Pilots train for this problem and are used to it. Nevertheless, there are limits to what safety regulators will allow and to what pilots will put up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitch changes with increasing angle of attack, however, are quite another thing. An airplane approaching an aerodynamic stall cannot, under any circumstances, have a tendency to go further into the stall. This is called “dynamic instability,” and the only airplanes that exhibit that characteristic—fighter jets—are also fitted with ejection seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the aviation community wants an airplane that flies as simply and as naturally as possible. That means that conditions should not change markedly, there should be no significant roll, no significant pitch change, no nothing when the pilot is adding power, lowering the flaps, or extending the landing gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airframe, the hardware, should get it right the first time and not need a lot of added bells and whistles to fly predictably. This has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle&quot;&gt;an aviation canon&lt;/a&gt; from the day the Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Hawk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the 737 Max pitched up a bit too much for comfort on power application as well as at already-high angles of attack. It violated that most ancient of aviation canons and probably violated the certification criteria of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. But instead of going back to the drawing board and getting the airframe hardware right (more on that below), Boeing relied on something called the “Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System,” or MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing’s solution to its hardware problem was software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will leave a discussion of the corporatization of the aviation lexicon for another article, but let’s just say another term might be the “Cheap way to prevent a stall when the pilots punch it,” or CWTPASWTPPI, system. Hmm. Perhaps MCAS is better, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCAS is certainly much less expensive than extensively modifying the airframe to accommodate the larger engines. Such an airframe modification would have meant things like longer landing gear (which might not then fit in the fuselage when retracted), more &lt;a href=&quot;https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/26759/how-does-the-dihedral-angle-work&quot;&gt;wing dihedral&lt;/a&gt; (upward bend), and so forth. All of those hardware changes would be horribly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote xlrg&quot;&gt;“Everything about the design and manufacture of the Max was done to preserve the myth that ‘it’s just a 737.’ Recertifying it as a new aircraft would have taken years and millions of dollars. In fact, the pilot licensed to fly the 737 in 1967 is still licensed to fly all subsequent versions of the 737.” &lt;span class=&quot;pq-attrib&quot;&gt;—Feedback on an earlier draft of this article from a 737 pilot for a major airline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, those changes could be extensive enough to require not only that the FAA recertify the 737 but that Boeing build an entirely new aircraft. Now we’re talking &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; money, both for the manufacturer as well as the manufacturer’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; major selling point of the 737 Max is that it is just a 737, and any pilot who has flown other 737s can fly a 737 Max without expensive training, without recertification, without another type of rating. Airlines—Southwest is a prominent example—tend to go for one “standard” airplane. They want to have one airplane that all their pilots can fly because that makes both pilots and airplanes fungible, maximizing flexibility and minimizing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to money, and in this case, MCAS was the way for both Boeing and its customers to keep the money flowing in the right direction. The necessity to insist that the 737 Max was no different in flying characteristics, no different in systems, from any other 737 was the key to the 737 Max’s fleet fungibility. That’s probably also the reason why the documentation about the MCAS system was kept on the down-low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put in a change with too much visibility, particularly a change to the aircraft’s operating handbook or to pilot training, and someone—probably a pilot—would have piped up and said, “Hey. This doesn’t look like a 737 anymore.” And then the money would flow the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I explained,&lt;/strong&gt; you can do your own angle-of-attack experiments just by putting your hand out a car door window and rotating it. It turns out that sophisticated aircraft have what is essentially the mechanical equivalent of a hand out the window: &lt;a href=&quot;https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2317/how-does-an-alpha-aoa-vane-work&quot;&gt;the angle-of-attack sensor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed this sensor when boarding a plane. There are usually two of them, one on either side of the plane, and usually just below the pilot’s windows. Don’t confuse them with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitot_tube&quot;&gt;pitot&lt;/a&gt; tubes (we’ll get to those later). The angle-of-attack sensors look like wind vanes, whereas the pitot tubes look like, well, tubes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angle-of-attack sensors look like wind vanes because that’s exactly what they are. They are mechanical hands designed to rotate in response to changes in that angle of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pitot tubes measure how much the air is “pressing” against the airplane, whereas the angle-of-attack sensors measure what direction that air is coming from. Because they measure air pressure, the pitot tubes are used to determine the aircraft’s speed through the air. The angle-of-attack sensors measure the aircraft’s direction relative to that air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two sets of angle-of-attack sensors and two sets of pitot tubes, one set on either side of the fuselage. Normal usage is to have the set on the pilot’s side feed the instruments on the pilot’s side and the set on the copilot’s side feed the instruments on the copilot’s side. That gives a state of natural redundancy in instrumentation that can be easily cross-checked by either pilot. If the copilot thinks his airspeed indicator is acting up, he can look over to the pilot’s airspeed indicator and see if it agrees. If not, both pilot and copilot engage in a bit of triage to determine which instrument is profane and which is sacred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago there was a joke that in the future planes would fly themselves, and the only thing in the cockpit would be a pilot and a dog. The pilot’s job was to make the passengers comfortable that someone was up front. The dog’s job was to bite the pilot if he tried to touch anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 737, Boeing not only included the requisite redundancy in instrumentation and sensors, it also included redundant flight computers—one on the pilot’s side, the other on the copilot’s side. The flight computers do a lot of things, but their main job is to fly the plane when commanded to do so and to make sure the human pilots don’t do anything wrong when they’re flying it. The latter is called “envelope protection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just call it what it is: the bitey dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s review what the MCAS does: It pushes the nose of the plane down when the system thinks the plane might exceed its angle-of-attack limits; it does so to avoid an aerodynamic stall. Boeing put MCAS into the 737 Max because the larger engines and their placement make a stall more likely in a 737 Max than in previous 737 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When MCAS senses that the angle of attack is too high, it commands the aircraft’s trim system (the system that makes the plane go up or down) to lower the nose. It also does something else: It pushes the pilot’s control columns (the things the pilots pull or push on to raise or lower the aircraft’s nose) downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 737 Max, like most modern airliners and most modern cars, everything is monitored by computer, if not directly controlled by computer. In many cases, there are no actual mechanical connections (cables, push tubes, hydraulic lines) between the pilot’s controls and the things on the wings, rudder, and so forth that actually make the plane move. And, even where there are mechanical connections, it’s up to the computer to determine if the pilots are engaged in good decision making (that’s the bitey dog again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also important that the pilots get physical feedback about what is going on. In the old days, when cables connected the pilot’s controls to the flying surfaces, you had to pull up, hard, if the airplane was trimmed to descend. You had to push, hard, if the airplane was trimmed to ascend. With computer oversight there is a loss of natural sense in the controls. In the 737 Max, there is no real “natural feel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, the 737 does employ redundant hydraulic systems, and those systems do link the pilot’s movement of the controls to the action of the ailerons and other parts of the airplane. But those hydraulic systems are powerful, and they do not give the pilot direct feedback from the aerodynamic forces that are acting on the ailerons. There is only an artificial feel, a feeling that the computer wants the pilots to feel. And sometimes, it doesn’t feel so great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the flight computer trims the airplane to descend, because the MCAS system thinks it’s about to stall, a set of motors and jacks push the pilot’s control columns forward. It turns out that the flight management computer can put a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of force into that column—indeed, so much force that a human pilot can quickly become exhausted trying to pull the column back, trying to tell the computer that this really, really should not be happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;zoom&quot; href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI3ODE4Mw.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration showing the Boeing 737 anti-stall system.&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/MzI3ODE4Mw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;magnifier&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustration: Norebbo.com The antistall system depended crucially on sensors that are installed on each side of the airliner—but the system consulted only the sensor on one side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, not letting the pilot regain control by pulling back on the column was an explicit design decision. Because if the pilots could pull up the nose when MCAS said it should go down, why have MCAS at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCAS is implemented in the flight management computer, even at times when the autopilot is turned off, when the pilots think they are flying the plane. In a fight between the flight management computer and human pilots over who is in charge, the computer will bite humans until they give up and (literally) die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s the need to keep the very existence of the MCAS system on the hush-hush lest someone say, “Hey, this isn’t your father’s 737,” and bank accounts start to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight management computer is a computer. What that means is that it’s not full of aluminum bits, cables, fuel lines, or all the other accoutrements of aviation. It’s full of lines of code. And that’s where things get dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those lines of code&lt;/strong&gt; were no doubt created by people at the direction of managers. Neither such coders nor their managers are as in touch with the particular culture and mores of the aviation world as much as the people who are down on the factory floor, riveting wings on, designing control yokes, and fitting landing gears. Those people have decades of institutional memory about what has worked in the past and what has not worked. Software people do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 737 Max, only one of the flight management computers is active at a time—either the pilot’s computer or the copilot’s computer. And the active computer takes inputs &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; from the sensors on its own side of the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the two computers disagree, the solution for the humans in the cockpit is  to look across the control panel to see  what the other instruments are saying and then sort it out. In the Boeing system, the flight  management computer does not “look  across” at the other instruments. It  believes only the instruments on its side. It doesn’t go old-school. It’s modern. It’s software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means is that if a particular angle-of-attack sensor goes haywire—which happens all the time in a machine that alternates from one extreme environment to another, vibrating and shaking all the way—the flight management computer just believes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets even worse. There are several other instruments that can be used to determine things like angle of attack, either directly or indirectly, such as the pitot tubes, the artificial horizons, etc. All of these things would be cross-checked by a human pilot to quickly diagnose a faulty angle-of-attack sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pinch, a human pilot could just look out the windshield to confirm visually and directly that, no, the aircraft is not pitched up dangerously. That’s the ultimate check and should go directly to the pilot’s ultimate sovereignty. Unfortunately, the current implementation of MCAS denies that sovereignty. It denies the pilots the ability to respond to what’s before their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like someone with narcissistic personality disorder, MCAS gaslights the pilots. And it turns out badly for everyone. “Raise the nose, HAL.” “I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the MCAS system, the flight management computer is blind to any other evidence that it is wrong, including what the pilot sees with his own eyes and what he does when he desperately tries to pull back on the robotic control columns that are biting him, and his passengers, to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old days, the FAA had armies of aviation engineers in its employ. Those FAA employees worked side by side with the airplane manufacturers to determine that an airplane was safe and could be certified as airworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As airplanes became more complex and the gulf between what the FAA could pay and what an aircraft manufacturer could pay grew larger, more and more of those engineers migrated from the public to the private sector. Soon the FAA had no in-house ability to determine if a particular airplane’s design and manufacture were safe. So the FAA said to the airplane manufacturers, “Why don’t you just have your people tell us if your designs are safe?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airplane manufacturers said, “Sounds good to us.” The FAA said, “And say hi to Joe, we miss him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus was born the concept of the “Designated Engineering Representative,” or DER. DERs are people in the employ of the airplane manufacturers, the engine manufacturers, and the software developers who certify to the FAA that it’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is not quite as sinister a conflict of interest as it sounds. It is in nobody’s interest that airplanes crash. The industry absolutely relies on the public trust, and every crash is an existential threat to the industry. No manufacturer is going to employ DERs that just pencil-whip the paperwork. On the other hand, though, after a long day and after the assurance of some software folks, they might just take their word that things will be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is astounding that no one who wrote the MCAS software for the 737 Max seems even to have raised the possibility of using multiple inputs, including the opposite angle-of-attack sensor, in the computer’s determination of an impending stall. As a lifetime member of the software development fraternity, I don’t know what toxic combination of inexperience, hubris, or lack of cultural understanding led to this mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do know that it’s indicative of a much deeper problem. The people who wrote the code for the original MCAS system were obviously terribly far out of their league and did not know it. How can they can implement a software fix, much less give us any comfort that the rest of the flight management software is reliable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Boeing produced&lt;/strong&gt; a dynamically unstable airframe, the 737 Max. That is big strike No. 1. Boeing then tried to mask the 737’s dynamic instability with a software system. Big strike No. 2. Finally, the software relied on systems known for their propensity to fail (angle-of-attack indicators) and did not appear to include even rudimentary provisions to cross-check the outputs of the angle-of-attack sensor against other sensors, or even the other angle-of-attack sensor. Big strike No. 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the above should have passed muster. None of the above should have passed the “OK” pencil of the most junior engineering staff, much less a DER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not a big strike. That’s a political, social, economic, and technical sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that, during the timeframe between the first 737 Max crash and the most recent 737 crash, I’d had the occasion to upgrade and install a brand-new digital autopilot in my own aircraft. I own a 1979 Cessna 172, the most common aircraft in history, at least by production numbers. Its original certification also predates that of the 737’s by about a decade (1955 versus 1967).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new autopilot consists of several very modern components, including redundant flight computers (dual Garmin G5s) and a sophisticated communication “bus” (a Controller Area Network bus) that lets all the various components talk to one another, irrespective of where they are located in my plane. A CAN bus derives from automotive “drive by wire” technology but is otherwise very similar in purpose and form to the various ARINC buses that connect the components in the 737 Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My autopilot also includes electric pitch trim. That means it can make the same types of configuration changes to my 172 that the flight computers and MCAS system make to the 737 Max. During the installation, after the first 737 Max crash, I remember remarking to a friend that it was not lost on me that I was potentially adding a hazard similar to the one that brought down the Lion Air crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my new autopilot also implements “envelope protection,” the envelope being the graph of the performance limitations of an aircraft. If my Cessna is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being flown by the autopilot, the system nonetheless constantly monitors the airplane to make sure that I am not about to stall it, roll it inverted, or a whole host of other things. Yes, it has its own “bitey dog” mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the similarities between my US $20,000 autopilot and the multimillion-dollar autopilot in every 737 are direct, tangible, and relevant. What, then, are the differences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, the installation of my autopilot required paperwork in the form of a “Supplemental Type Certificate,” or STC. It means that the autopilot manufacturer and the FAA both agreed that my 1979 Cessna 172 with its (Garmin) autopilot was so significantly different from what the airplane was when it rolled off the assembly line that it was &lt;em&gt;no longer the same Cessna 172.&lt;/em&gt; It was a different aircraft altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to now carrying a new (supplemental) aircraft-type certificate (and certification), my 172 required a very large amount of new paperwork to be carried in the plane, in the form of revisions and addenda to the aircraft operating manual. As you can guess, most of those addenda revolved around the autopilot system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular note in that documentation, which must be studied and understood by anyone who flies the plane, are various explanations of the autopilot system, including its command of the trim control system and its envelope protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are instructions on how to detect when the system malfunctions &lt;em&gt;and how to disable the system, immediately.&lt;/em&gt; Disabling the system means pulling the autopilot circuit breaker; instructions on how to do that are strewn throughout the documentation, repeatedly. Every pilot who flies my plane becomes intimately aware that it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as any other 172.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big difference between what pilots who want to fly my plane are told and what pilots stepping into a 737 Max are (or were) told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difference is between the autopilots in my system and that in the 737 Max. All of the CAN bus–interconnected components constantly do the kind of instrument cross-check that human pilots do and that, apparently, the MCAS system in the 737 Max does not. For example, the autopilot itself has a self-contained attitude platform that checks the attitude information coming from the G5 flight computers. If there is a disagreement, the system simply goes off-line and alerts the pilot that she is now flying manually. It doesn’t point the airplane’s nose at the ground, thinking it’s about to stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest difference is in the amount of physical force it takes for the pilot to override the computers in the two planes. In my 172, there are still cables linking the controls to the flying surfaces. The computer has to press on the same things that I have to press on—and its strength is nowhere near as great as mine. So even if, say, the computer thought that my plane was about to stall when it wasn’t, I can easily overcome the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my Cessna, humans still win a battle of the wills every time. That used to be a design philosophy of every Boeing aircraft, as well, and one they used against their archrival Airbus, which had a different philosophy. But it seems that with the 737 Max, Boeing has changed philosophies about human/machine interaction as quietly as they’ve changed their aircraft operating manuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 737 Max saga teaches us not only about the limits of technology and the risks of complexity, it teaches us about our real priorities. Today, safety doesn’t come first—money comes first, and safety’s only utility in that regard is in helping to keep the money coming. The problem is getting worse because our devices are increasingly dominated by something that’s all too easy to manipulate: software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware defects, whether they are engines placed in the wrong place on a plane or &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/heroic-failures/the-space-shuttle-a-case-of-subjective-engineering&quot;&gt;O-rings&lt;/a&gt; that turn brittle when cold, are notoriously hard to fix. And by hard, I mean expensive. Software defects, on the other hand, are easy and cheap to fix. All you need to do is post an update and push out a patch. What’s more, we’ve trained consumers to consider this normal, whether it’s an update to my desktop operating systems or the patches that get posted automatically to my Tesla while I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1990s, I wrote an article comparing the relative complexity of the Pentium processors of that era, expressed as the number of transistors on the chip, to the complexity of the Windows operating system, expressed as the number of lines of code. I found that the complexity of the Pentium processors and the contemporaneous Windows operating system was roughly equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the time when early Pentiums were affected by what was known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emery.com/1e/pentium.htm&quot;&gt;FDIV bug&lt;/a&gt;. It affected only a tiny fraction of Pentium users. Windows was also affected by similar defects, also affecting only fractions of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the effects on the companies were quite different. Where Windows addressed its small defects with periodic software updates, in 1994 Intel recalled the (slightly) defective processors. It cost the company $475 million—more than $800 million in today’s money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the relative ease—not to mention the lack of tangible cost—of software updates has created a cultural laziness within the software engineering community. Moreover, because more and more of the hardware that we create is monitored and controlled by software, that cultural laziness is now creeping into hardware engineering—like building airliners. Less thought is now given to getting a design correct and simple up front because it’s so easy to fix what you didn’t get right later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time a software update gets pushed to my Tesla, to the Garmin flight computers in my Cessna, to my Nest thermostat, and to the TVs in my house, I’m reminded that none of those things were complete when they left the factory—because their builders realized they didn’t have to be complete. The job could be done at any time in the future with a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inlay pullquote xlrg&quot;&gt;“I’m a software developer turned network engineer and have written airliner avionics software in the past. It was interesting how many hoops we had to jump through to get an add-on board for the computer certified, while software certifications were nil (other than “cannot run on Windows,” “must be written in C++”). This was, admittedly, nearly 10 years ago, and I hope that things have changed since.” &lt;span class=&quot;pq-attrib&quot;&gt;—Anonymous, personal correspondence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boeing is in the process&lt;/strong&gt; of rolling out a set of software updates to the 737 Max flight control system, including MCAS. I don’t know, but I suspect that those updates will center on two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having the software “cross-check” system indicators, just as a human pilot would. Meaning, if one angle-of-attack indicator says the plane’s about to stall, but the other one says it’s not so, at least hold off judgment about pushing the nose down into the dirt and maybe let a pilot or two know you’re getting conflicting signals.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backing off on the “shoot first, ask questions later” design philosophy—meaning, looking at multiple inputs.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the life of me, I do not know why those two basic aviation design considerations, bedrocks of a mind-set that has served the industry so well until now, were not part of the original MCAS design. And, when they were not, I do not know or understand what part of the DER process failed to catch the fundamental design defect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I suspect that it all has to do with the same thing that brought us from Boeing’s initial desire to put larger engines on the 737 and to avoid having to internalize the cost of those larger engines—in other words, to do what every child is taught is impossible: get a free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on simplicity comes from the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/shrink-the-targets&quot;&gt;Charles Perrow&lt;/a&gt;, a sociologist at Yale University whose 1984 book, &lt;em&gt;Normal Accidents: Living With High-Risk Technologies&lt;/em&gt;, tells it all in the very title. Perrow argues that system failure is a normal outcome in any system that is very complex and whose components are “tightly bound”—meaning that the behavior of one component immediately controls the behavior of another. Though such failures may seem to stem from one or another faulty part or practice, they must be seen as inherent in the system itself. They are “normal” failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this problem more acutely felt than in systems designed to augment or improve safety. Every increment, every increase in complexity, ultimately leads to decreasing rates of return and, finally, to negative returns. Trying to patch and then repatch such a system in an attempt to make it safer can end up making it less safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the root of the old engineering axiom “Keep it simple, stupid” (KISS) and its aviation-specific counterpart: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/genius-colin-chapman-simplify-then-add-lightness%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;Simplify, then add lightness.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original FAA Eisenhower-era certification requirement was a testament to simplicity: Planes should not exhibit significant pitch changes with changes in engine power. That requirement was written when there was a direct connection between the controls in the pilot’s hands and the flying surfaces on the airplane. Because of that, the requirement—when written—rightly imposed a discipline of simplicity on the design of the airframe itself. Now software stands between man and machine, and no one seems to know exactly what is going on. Things have become too complex to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot get the parallels between the 737 Max and the space shuttle Challenger out of my head. The Challenger accident, another textbook case study in normal failure, came about not because people didn’t follow the rules but because they did. In the Challenger case, the rules said that they had to have prelaunch conferences to ascertain flight readiness. It didn’t say that a significant input to those conferences couldn’t be the political considerations of delaying a launch. The inputs were weighed, the process was followed, and a majority consensus was to launch. And seven people died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 737 Max case, the rules were also followed. The rules said you couldn’t have a large pitch-up on power change and that an employee of the manufacturer, a DER, could sign off on whatever you came up with to prevent a pitch change on power change. The rules didn’t say that the DER couldn’t take the business considerations into the decision-making process. And 346 people are dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that MCAS, originally added in the spirit of increasing safety, has now killed more people than it could have ever saved. It doesn’t need to be “fixed” with more complexity, more software. It needs to be removed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Keeping master green at scale</title>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant monolithic source-code repositories are one of the fundamental pillars of the back end infrastructure in large and fast-paced software companies. The sheer volume of everyday code changes demands a reliable and efficient change management system with three uncompromisable key requirements—always green master, high throughput, and low commit turnaround time. Green refers to a master branch that always successfully compiles and passes all build steps, the opposite being red. A broken master (red) leads to delayed feature rollouts because a faulty code commit needs to be detected and rolled backed. Additionally, a red master has a cascading effect that hampers developer productivity—developers might face local test/build failures, or might end up working on a codebase that will eventually be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the design and implementation of SubmitQueue. It guarantees an always green master branch at scale: all build steps (e.g., compilation, unit tests, UI tests) successfully execute for every commit point. SubmitQueue has been in production for over a year, and can scale to thousands of daily commits to giant monolithic repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
