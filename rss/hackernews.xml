<description>&lt;p&gt;I lost my daughter Aisha to suicide Feb 1st of this year. I send you my heartfelt condolences as only a parent, who has been through this, to another can share. I am glad to see you continue to honor his memory. I can only imagine how difficult July 11th is for you üòû&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Not only will Apple Silicon make better Macs, it will force Microsoft to polish its Windows on ARM act, both hardware and software. In turn, this will cause PC OEMs to reconsider their allegiance to x86 silicon‚Ä¶and that will have serious consequences for the old Wintel partnership.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;e544&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Why should Intel worry about Apple‚Äôs decision to base future Macs on homegrown Apple Silicon SoC (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;System on a Chip&lt;/a&gt;) devices? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/09/pc-shipments-q2-2020/&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dataquest and IDC estimates&lt;/a&gt;, Apple owns no more than 7% of the PC market. Furthermore, Apple doesn‚Äôt buy the expensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Xeon&lt;/a&gt; chips, used in millions of Cloud servers, that represent a growing proportion of Intel‚Äôs revenue. And the company is a headache: It makes demands and complaints way out of proportion with the amount of revenue it generates. Losing Apple is more symbol than substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;03bd&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Not so fast. The impact on Intel ‚Äî and the entire industry ‚Äî will be felt beyond Apple‚Äôs small share of the PC market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3d0b&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Apple isn‚Äôt simply dropping a proudly designed homegrown CPU in place of an Intel chip on Mac motherboards. Moving to Apple Silicon is an expensive undertaking that affects hardware and software engineering, developer relationships, marketing‚Ä¶ If the switch to Apple Silicon were a mere CPU replacement, billions of dollars would burn in a bonfire of vanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bf21&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;No. Apple sees its SoC as a means to make the Mac &lt;em class=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, ‚Äúbetter‚Äù is a dangerously vague adjective that needs some evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8ffe&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;We‚Äôll start with power dissipation. My MacBook Pro gets hot‚Ä¶&lt;em class=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hot. Apple doesn‚Äôt specify the exact chip, but it appears to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/i7-processors/i7-8559u.html&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this Intel iCore 7 processor&lt;/a&gt; that has a 28 Watt TDP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/438898/what-is-tdp-for-cpus-and-gpus/&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Thermal Design Power&lt;/a&gt;; think of it as a ‚Äúpower budget‚Äù).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;415d&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Let‚Äôs compare this with the latest iPad Pros that feature an A12Z Apple processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;146c&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/so-just-how-powerful-are-apples-new-laptop-chips-gonna-1844134011&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Geekbench tests&lt;/a&gt;, A12Z performance matches or exceeds my MacBook Pro. Apple doesn‚Äôt disclose the TDP for the A12Z processor, but we can rely on an indirect number, the iPad Pro‚Äôs 18W power adapter output. This gives us an idea of what to expect from Apple Silicon in future Macs: Significantly lower TDP without losing processing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c179&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Next, throughput. Given what we see with today‚Äôs A12Z, one can‚Äôt imagine tomorrow‚Äôs Apple Silicon Macs providing less than a 25% throughput advantage against corresponding x86 PCs. Admittedly, these are speculative, broad strokes assumption for Apple Silicon Macs ‚Äî think faster, svelter laptops &lt;em class=&quot;hc&quot;&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; lasting 10 hours on a battery charge. If not, once again, why bother burning the billions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;77e0&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Next comes the matter of software, one that Apple took pains to handle at last month‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2020/&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WWDC&lt;/a&gt; by demonstrating native versions of big standards (Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop‚Ä¶) and showing off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macobserver.com/news/wwdc2020-rosetta-2-apple-silicon-macs-virtualization/&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rosetta 2 emulator&lt;/a&gt;. More concretely, Apple immediately shipped large numbers of its DTK (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Transition_Kit_(2020)&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Developer Transition Kit&lt;/a&gt;) to help third-party developers port their apps. First impressions of the kit, which provides an Apple Silicon Mac prototype running an A12Z processor inside a Mac mini box, are promising: The hardware is fast and the software tools are more mature than one might have expected at this early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eb7a&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;We‚Äôll know more when Apple Silicon Macs ship in a few months, but it appears that the hardware and software transition seems to have been carefully planned and executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0395&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;So how will this affect Intel and the industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7937&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;In 2012, Microsoft started the move away from Intel‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;x86&lt;/a&gt; processors with its first Surface machine running on an ARM &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SoC&lt;/a&gt; engine. It didn‚Äôt work too well. But Microsoft persisted and, late last year, came up with the Surface Pro X powered by another ARM-based SoC and running Windows on ARM. It was an improvement, but many reviewers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950487/microsoft-surface-pro-x-7-review-comparison-specs-photos&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;still weren‚Äôt charmed&lt;/a&gt;. To cite but one problem, Microsoft‚Äôs bread and butter apps didn‚Äôt run in native mode. This was made even more embarrassing when Office on Apple Silicon was demonstrated at last months‚Äôs WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;30d0&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;This leaves Microsoft with a choice: Either forget Windows on ARM and concede modern PCs to Apple, or forge ahead, fix app compatibility problems and offer an ARM-based alternative to Apple‚Äôs new Macs. It‚Äôs a false dilemma, of course. Microsoft will forge ahead‚Ä¶with repercussions for the rest of the Windows PC industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;140e&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Specifically, what are Dell, HP, Asus, and others going to do if Apple offers materially better laptops and desktops and Microsoft continues to improve Windows on ARM Surface devices? In order to compete, PC manufacturers will have to follow suit, they‚Äôll ‚Äúgo ARM‚Äù because, all defensive rhetoric aside, Apple and Microsoft will have made the x86 architecture feel like what it actually is: old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ba3e&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;This won‚Äôt happen overnight and there will be an interesting mess of x86 and ARM SoC machines fighting it out in the marketplace. Large organizations need continuity and would balk at the prospect of servicing two kinds of Windows machines and apps. As usual, they‚Äôll downplay Apple‚Äôs advantage and curse Microsoft for causing trouble. But if the newer machines are actually better, rogue members within these organizations will sneak in new devices and software, they always do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3cda&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;We now come to Intel‚Äôs reaction. Not what they‚Äôll say when the trouble really starts, which could be soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;539a&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Intel execs know they missed the Smartphone 2.0 revolution because of culture blindness. They couldn‚Äôt bear to part with the high margins generated by the x86 cash cow; they couldn‚Äôt see that lower margins could be supported by unimaginable volume. Now, Intel is facing a more serious problem: The x86 commands high margins not because of the chip, but because of the Intel/Windows duopoly, meaning that, all other things being equal, chips not running Windows get lower margins than an x86 CPU. Now, that union, that advantage is about to disappear. Intel will face ARM-based SoCs running Windows on ARM with applications, in PC-like quantities, at lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b956&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;This leaves Intel with one path: if you can‚Äôt beat them, join them. Intel will re-take an ARM license (it sold its &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XScale&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ARM-based XScale business&lt;/a&gt; to Marvell in 2006) and come up with a competitive ARM SoC offering for PC OEMs. Margins will inevitably suffer as the ARM-based SoC field is filled with sharp competitors such as Qualcomm and Nvidia, sure to be joined by arch-enemy AMD and others, all ushering in a new era of PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4bf4&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;I‚Äôve avoided discussing Intel‚Äôs high-margin server chips and if/when/how they will be affected by more power-efficient ARM-based chips such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/&quot; class=&quot;co fs in io ip iq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;AWS Graviton&lt;/a&gt;. I don‚Äôt know enough about the specifics of Intel‚Äôs monster (and electricity-hungry) Xeon chips powering forests of Cloud servers to form an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d8f3&quot; class=&quot;gi gj as gk b gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz ha di eh&quot;&gt;Wintel‚Äôs passing is a heavy-enough topic for today.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US citizens warned they face arbitrary arrest in China</title>
<link>https://m.dw.com/en/us-citizens-warned-they-face-arbitrary-arrest-in-china/a-54144205</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://m.dw.com/en/us-citizens-warned-they-face-arbitrary-arrest-in-china/a-54144205</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The US State Department has warned US citizens in China of an increased risk of arbitrary¬†detention by¬†authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department specifically cautioned against the threat of deportation or detainment &quot;for sending private electronic messages critical&quot; of the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;US citizens may be detained without access to US consular services or information about their alleged crime,&quot; the advisory, published on Saturday, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit bans and long interrogations were also mentioned as potential threats to US citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department described the rules as &quot;arbitrary enforcement of local laws for purposes other than maintaining law and order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tensions mounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between the US and China have hit rock bottom recently¬†over the coronavirus, trade and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump told reporters Friday that the relationship with China had been &quot;severely¬†damaged.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more:&lt;/em&gt;¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/sierens-china-trump-keeps-threats-to-china-over-hong-kong-vague/a-53674678&quot;&gt;Sieren's China: Trump keeps threats to China over Hong Kong vague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has been vocally critical of the controversial security law pushed on Hong Kong in June. The legislation bans subversive acts and speech against the¬†Chinese government made anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dw.com/en/complete-decoupling-from-china-remains-an-option-says-trump/a-53866003&quot;&gt;Trump has also repeatedly blamed China&lt;/a&gt; for their handling of the coronavirus crisis and what he describes as their failure to communicate accurate information early in the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also come under fire for reports of human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang provinces in the west of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials have threatened retaliation for US sanctions on Chinese officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Washington¬†announced¬†visa bans and an assets freeze on three officials, including Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party chief in Xinjiang and architect of Beijing's hardline policies against restive minorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia and Canada are among the other countries that also issued travel warnings over fears of arbitrary detentions. China has been accused of arbitrarily detaining foreign citizens who disagree with officials.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Future of Online Identity Is Decentralized</title>
<link>https://yarmo.eu/post/future-online-identity-decentralized</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://yarmo.eu/post/future-online-identity-decentralized</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Online identity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity&quot;&gt;Online¬†identity&lt;/a&gt; refers to the concept of &quot;being&quot; in the digital world. As an internet user, you exist. You create accounts on websites. You write on social media and blogs. You post photos. All this online activity has in common that one and the same person performed these actions; it defines your &quot;online¬†identity&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, your &quot;online¬†identity&quot; is not &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; representative of your &quot;social¬†identity&quot; in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may choose to use your own name or a pseudonym. You may choose to publish personally identifiable information or not. You may choose to remain truthful to your social identity or deceive. In short, you may choose for authenticity or for anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authenticity versus anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authenticity and anonymity aren't mutually exclusive and that is the beauty of the internet. In the physical realm, you are (mostly) limited to a single social identity. In the digital space, there are no such restrictions. While you can't embody multiple persons in the offline world, you can have several identities online. In fact, you can even have multiple accounts on the same platform, opting for a different balance between authenticity and anonymity for each one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymity has its downsides, creating psychological artifacts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect&quot;&gt;online¬†disinhibition&lt;/a&gt; and facilitating &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying&quot;&gt;cyberharassment&lt;/a&gt;. However, even though we are far from completely overcoming these challenges, the internet that allows us to remain anonymous is still the one we should want and fight for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidation of identity and internet corporations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the possibility for anonymity could solve the problem of online toxicity. Large internet corporations like Google and Facebook allow all to create an account on condition that some personally identifiable information is revealed, usually a phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit is that it deters most from repeatably creating new accounts when older accounts have been flagged or banned due to improper behavior. These companies gain the function of &quot;identity provider&quot;: they manage your online identity that can be used to login in different locations of the internet. We all know many websites that offer a &quot;Google login&quot; or &quot;Facebook login&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a problem: handling the entire online identity of a single person is too much responsibility for any corporation or organization, especially if it is in their interest to gain intimate individual knowledge and sell it (Google) or use it to manipulate moods and influence decision making (Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That phone number that was once used to prevent online toxicity is now the first of many pieces of personally identifiable information that these corporations will seek and use to figure out who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have nothing to hide&quot;? Great. The internet corporations will still make money hand over fist by selling your personality, your preferences, your buying patterns and your vote. And not just yours. That of entire populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that profits are just the tip of the iceberg. Governments all around the world are also interested in knowing what their citizens think, say and do for very different motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going decentralized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is relatively simple. When you create a new account and get to choose between &quot;Google¬†login&quot;, &quot;Facebook¬†login&quot; and &quot;Email¬†login&quot;, pick &quot;Email¬†login&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of not giving away any more personal data and tracking possibilities outweigh the inconvenience of having to fill in your email address and a password, especially when using a password manager. As tempting as the alternative is, making these changes will improve your life and ultimately, when enough people join these efforts, that of the world population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different problem arises: how to prove online identity when decentralized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decentralized online identity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are no longer relying on an identity provider to manage your entire online identity, you lose the one common thing all your accounts on different platforms had: if two accounts on different online platforms are created by the same Google or Facebook account, we can safely assume they belong to the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this &quot;trust by proxy&quot; is lost when the accounts on those platforms were created without identity provider. And whether authentic or anonymous, it can sometimes be extremely useful to know and trust that separate accounts on the internet belong to the same person, even when not knowing who this person is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The username is not sufficient to identify accounts across platforms. If you are &quot;Alice&quot; on one website, chances are you might need to be &quot;Alice123&quot; on the next one. And what if someone close to you is contacted by an &quot;Aliss&quot; requesting an amount of money to be transferred because they believe you to be in some sort of trouble? A poor attempt at impersonation, I know‚Ä¶ Don't worry, a real bad actor will put in more effort and make a much more convincing act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proving decentralized online identity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if not only your online identity is decentralized, but also the tool to prove said online identity? This would mean that you wouldn't need to depend on a single company or entity to prove your identity across platforms. Decentralized identity, decentralized proofs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such solutions are already being deployed in industry, for example by firms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://indicio.tech/&quot;&gt;Indicio.tech&lt;/a&gt; which focus on blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built for individuals, I recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://keyoxide.org&quot;&gt;Keyoxide&lt;/a&gt; which uses cryptographic keypairs to accomplish decentralized identity verification. While it doesn't (and shouldn't!) link an account to a person in the physical realm, it links accounts across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you trust an account on one platform, you can trust any other account on any other platform as long as they are both verified by &quot;identity proofs&quot; stored in the same keypair. Whether you choose authenticity or anonymity, decentralized identity proofs allow you to build a cross-platform online identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my &lt;a href=&quot;https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d&quot;&gt;Keyoxide profile&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, I link to several &quot;authentic&quot; accounts but I could easily generate a new keypair void of personal data that links to several anonymous accounts. The accounts don't need to be authentic to create an online persona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the accounts listed in the link above belong to me. No one else could claim these accounts. Here's how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identity proofs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &quot;identity proof&quot; is nothing more than a link to an account A on some platform P stored inside your keypair K. If a &quot;proof verification tool&quot; such as Keyoxide follows this link and discovers some piece of data linking back to keypair K (which is only possible if keypair K and account A on platform P belong to the same person), the account is verified. If this proof verification is done for several accounts on different platforms, it is beyond reasonable doubt that the same person owns said accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No bad actor could claim one of your accounts: the piece of data that links back is specific to your keypair, not the bad actor's keypair. And the bad actor also couldn't insert a proof inside your keypair as long as your keypair isn't compromised. Only you, the owner of the keypair, can add new proofs. But the entire world can read and verify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These identity proofs are decentralized because Keyoxide doesn't store them, your cryptographic keypair does. Keyoxide simply reads the keys and verifies the proofs. When you remove a proof from your keypair, Keyoxide will no longer have access to it. You own your proofs and your online identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the proofs are readable by everyone and are not specifically designed for Keyoxide. Anyone can use any tool or create new ones to verify these proofs and developers are encouraged to enrich this field with additional tools and services. Let's build a decentralized identity ecosystem we can all trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online identity beyond today's internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initiatives like &lt;a href=&quot;https://inrupt.com/solid&quot;&gt;Solid&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee&quot;&gt;Sir Tim Berners-Lee&lt;/a&gt; are paving the way for a new internet where all data is owned by the user and shared with platforms with consent and restrictions. This would solve the online identity problem: you get the benefits of a &quot;pseudo centralized&quot; account while maintaining full ownership over all account-related data stored on a decentralized platform. Social media would be allowed to see some data, messaging platforms some other data. But there would still be one single account to rule all the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On today's internet, the best we can do is make fully separated accounts, link them using technologies like decentralized online identity proofs and create our own online personas, with our own open tools that ensure we maintain ownership over them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Just Too Efficient</title>
<link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient</guid>
<description>&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;On a Spring 2019 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/Liking-Beijing&quot;&gt;walk in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; I saw two street sweepers at a sunny corner. They were beat-up looking and grizzled but probably younger than me. They‚Äôd paused work to smoke and talk. One told a story; the other‚Äôs eyes widened and then he laughed so hard he had to bend over, leaning on his broom. I suspect their jobs and pay were lousy and their lives constrained in ways I can‚Äôt imagine. But they had time to smoke a cigarette and crack a joke. You know what that‚Äôs called? Waste, inefficiency, a suboptimal outcome. Some of the brightest minds in our economy are earnestly engaged in stamping it out. They‚Äôre winning, but everyone‚Äôs losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve felt this for years, and there‚Äôs plenty of evidence:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Item:&lt;/em&gt; Every successful little store with a personality morphs into a chain because that‚Äôs more efficient. The personality becomes part of the brand and thus rote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Item:&lt;/em&gt; I go to a deli fifteen minutes away to buy bacon, rashers cut from the slab while I wait, because they‚Äôre better. Except when I can‚Äôt, in which case I buy a waterlogged plastic-encased product at the supermarket; no standing or waiting! It‚Äôs obvious which is more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Item:&lt;/em&gt; I‚Äôve learned, when I have a problem with a tech vendor, to seek out the online-chat help service; there‚Äôs annoying latency between question and answers as the service rep multiplexes me in with lots of other people‚Äôs problems, but at least the dialog starts without endless minutes on hold; a really super-efficient process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Item:&lt;/em&gt; Speaking of which, it seems that when you have a problem with a business, the process for solving it each year becomes more and more complex and opaque and irritating and (for the business) efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Item, item, item; as the world grows more efficient it grows less flavorful and less human. Because the more efficient you are, the less humans you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-1&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;The end-game&lt;/span&gt; ¬∑ Efficiency, taken to the max, can get very dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest investing a few minutes in reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/&quot;&gt;Behind the Smiles&lt;/a&gt; by Will Evans. Summary: Certain (not all) Amazon warehouses seem to have per-employee injury rates that are significantly higher than the industry average, as in twice as high or more. Apparent reason: It‚Äôs not they‚Äôre actually dangerous places to work, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôve maximized efficiency and reduced waste to the point where people are picking and packing and shipping &lt;em&gt;every minute&lt;/em&gt; they‚Äôre working, never stopping. And a certain proportion of human bodies simply can‚Äôt manage that. They break down under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robots matter, but not in the way you might think. The idea was that robotized warehouses should reduce stress and strain because they bring the pick-and-pack to the employees, rather than the people having to walk around to where the items are. But apparently robots correlate with &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; injury rates. &lt;cite&gt;Behind the Smiles&lt;/cite&gt; quotes employee Jonathan Meador: ‚Äú‚ÄòBefore robots, it was still tough, but it was manageable,‚Äô he said. Afterward, ‚Äòwe were in a fight that we just can‚Äôt win.‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs important to realize that Amazon isn‚Äôt violating any rules, nor even (on the surface) societal norms. Waste is bad, efficiency is good, right? They‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs taught in every business school; maximizing efficiency is one of the greatest gifts of the free market. Amazon is really extremely good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it‚Äôs good, until it isn‚Äôt any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-2&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Efficiency and weakness&lt;/span&gt; ¬∑ Let‚Äôs hand the mike over to Bruce Schneier. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/07/the_security_va.html&quot;&gt;The Security Value of Inefficiency&lt;/a&gt; he makes one of those points that isn‚Äôt obvious until you hear it. Quoting briefly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAll of the overcapacity that has been squeezed out of our healthcare system; we now wish we had it. All of the redundancy in our food production that has been consolidated away; we want that, too. We need our old, local supply chains&lt;span class=&quot;dashes&quot;&gt;‚Äâ‚Äî&lt;/span&gt;‚Äânot the single global ones that are so fragile in this crisis. And we want our local restaurants and businesses to survive, not just the national chains.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce is pointing out that overoptimizing efficiency doesn‚Äôt just burn people out, it also too often requires cutting into what you later realize were prudent safety margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-3&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;How hard should people work?&lt;/span&gt; ¬∑ Today, we assume the forty-hour week without thanking the generations of socialists and unionists in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day&quot;&gt;Eight-hour-day movement&lt;/a&gt;, whose struggle started around 1817 and didn‚Äôt bear global fruit until the middle of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there‚Äôs nothing axiomatic about forty hours. Twenty years ago, France &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35-hour_workweek&quot;&gt;introduced a 35-hour workweek&lt;/a&gt;. Their economy still functions. And John Maynard Keynes, approximately the most influential economist in the history of the world, predicted his grandchildren would enjoy a 15-hour workweek. It seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2015/08/13/432122637/keynes-predicted-we-would-be-working-15-hour-weeks-why-was-he-so-wrong&quot;&gt;he was wrong&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/the-misunderstood-15-hour-work-week-of-john-maynard-keynes-9d4561c96ab6&quot;&gt;maybe only partly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course Keynes himself worked like a madman. As did I, for most of my career. Because some jobs are just jobs, but others are vocations; people doing what they love, and who‚Äôd really rather be working than not. Nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideologists of Capitalism think that every business should try to make every job a vocation, that people should be delighted with their work, with the benefit (for the capitalist) that you don‚Äôt have to hire that many. One famous example of this thinking is at UPS, the delivery company, whose leaders wanted the delivery people to ‚Äúbleed brown‚Äù. Here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://isreview.org/issues/58/rev-ups.shtml&quot;&gt;an interesting take&lt;/a&gt; on the UPS story, in which the ‚Äúbleeding brown‚Äù notion didn‚Äôt catch on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while there‚Äôs nothing wrong with vocations&lt;span class=&quot;dashes&quot;&gt;‚Äâ‚Äî&lt;/span&gt;‚ÄâI‚Äôm lucky and blessed to have found one&lt;span class=&quot;dashes&quot;&gt;‚Äâ‚Äî&lt;/span&gt;‚Äâmost jobs are just jobs. Whether it be a job or a vacation, work should at least leave time for a smoke break in the sun at the corner (or its 21st-century equivalent). And it‚Äôs perfectly possible that Keynes‚Äô prediction could come true, in certain future economic configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;But, wealth!&lt;/span&gt; ¬∑ If we all work less, we‚Äôll be poorer, right? Because the total cash output of the economy is a (weird, nonlinear) function of the amount of work that gets put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds like it should be important, until you ask basic questions like ‚Äúhow much money is there, and who has it?‚Äù The answers, pretty clearly, are ‚ÄúToo much‚Äù and ‚ÄúAn inefficiently small number of very wealthy people.‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/the-1-percent-dont-know-what-to-do-with-money-2019-6&quot;&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; has a nice take on the problem, highlighting the evidence for and consequences of there being just too much money around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, interest rates stay low, governments can borrow more or less for free, and all sorts of crazily doomed shit is getting investment funding. There is really no evidence anywhere of a global shortage of money, and plenty for the existence of a surplus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-8&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Stop and think&lt;/span&gt; ¬∑ Specifically, do it when something is annoying you; at work, or in your personal interaction with a big organization. Could this be explained by someone, somewhere, trying to be more efficient? In my life, the answer is almost always ‚Äúyes‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;p-9&quot; class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Cracks&lt;/span&gt; ¬∑ ‚ÄúThere is a crack in everything, that‚Äôs how the light gets in‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/835076/leonard-cohens-anthem-the-story-of-the-line-there-is-a-crack-in-everything-thats-how-the-light-gets-in/&quot;&gt;sang Leonard Cohen&lt;/a&gt;. And there need to be cracks in the surface of work, in the broader organizational fabric that operates the world. Because that‚Äôs where the humanity happens. You can be like the people who optimize warehouses and call the gaps ‚Äúwaste‚Äù. But that path, followed far enough, leads to a world that we really don‚Äôt want to be living in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard to think of a position more radical than being ‚Äúagainst efficiency‚Äù. And I‚Äôm not. Efficiency is a good, and like most good things, has to be bought somehow, and paid for. There is a point where the price is too high, and we‚Äôve passed it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Do not remain nameless to yourself (1966)</title>

<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Above: Richard Feynman in 1984&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, nine years after gaining his Ph.D. with a dissertation titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/167/1/Mano_k_1955.pdf&quot;&gt;The Self-Energy of the Scalar Nucleon&lt;/a&gt;, physicist Koichi Mano wrote a congratulatory letter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman&quot;&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/a&gt;, the man who had originally taught him at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology&quot;&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, joint-recipient of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize in Physics&lt;/a&gt; for his pioneering work in quantum electrodynamics. Feynman replied with an enquiry about Mano‚Äôs current job, to which Mano responded that he was ‚Äústudying the Coherence theory with some applications to the propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent atmosphere [‚Ä¶] a humble and down-to-earth type of problem.‚Äù Feynman responded with this letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letter taken from the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://booksofnote.com/book/more-letters-of-note&quot;&gt;More Letters of Note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; book which is available now in all decent, sensible, and wise bookshops. &lt;a href=&quot;http://booksofnote.com/book/more-letters-of-note&quot;&gt;More info here&lt;/a&gt;. Photo by¬†Tamiko Thiel, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RichardFeynman-PaineMansionWoods1984_copyrightTamikoThiel_bw.jpg&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Koichi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a position in the Research Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately your letter made me unhappy for you seem to be truly sad. It seems that the influence of your teacher has been to give you a false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you can really solve easily, no matter how trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take away from yourself these pleasures because you have some erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You met me at the peak of my career when I seemed to you to be concerned with problems close to the gods. But at the same time I had another Ph.D. Student (Albert Hibbs) whose thesis was on how it is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with the problem he wanted to solve. With you I made a mistake, I gave you the problem instead of letting you find your own; and left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant or important to work on (namely those problems you see you may do something about). I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this letter to correct it a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call humble, but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed. For example, experiments on the coefficient of friction on highly polished surfaces, to try to learn something about how friction worked (failure). Or, how elastic properties of crystals depends on the forces between the atoms in them, or how to make electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio knobs). Or, how neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the reflection of electromagnetic waves from films coating glass. The development of shock waves in explosions. The design of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture electrons from the L-orbits, but not the K-orbits. General theory of how to fold paper to make a certain type of child‚Äôs toy (called flexagons). The energy levels in the light nuclei. The theory of turbulence (I have spent several years on it without success). Plus all the ‚Äúgrander‚Äù problems of quantum theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself ‚Äì it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your na√Øve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher‚Äôs ideals are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of luck and happiness.&lt;br/&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;Richard P. Feynman&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub quietly released a new feature at some point in the past few days: profile READMEs. Create a repository with the same name as your GitHub account (in my case that‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/simonw&quot;&gt;github.com/simonw/simonw&lt;/a&gt;), add a &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; to it and GitHub will render the contents at the top of your personal profile page‚Äîfor me that‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw&quot;&gt;github.com/simonw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn‚Äôt resist re-using the trick &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/&quot;&gt;from this blog post&lt;/a&gt; and implementing a GitHub Action to automatically keep my profile README up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw&quot;&gt;github.com/simonw&lt;/a&gt; and you‚Äôll see a three-column README showing my latest GitHub project releases, my latest blog entries and my latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://til.simonwillison.net/&quot;&gt;TILs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;My GitHub profile&quot; src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2020/simonw-github.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm doing this with a GitHub Action in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/simonw/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml&quot;&gt;build.yml&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs configured to run on every push to the repo, on a schedule at 32 minutes past the hour and on the new &lt;code&gt;workflow_dispatch&lt;/code&gt; event which means I get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/&quot;&gt;manual button I can click&lt;/a&gt; to trigger it on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Action runs a Python script called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/simonw/blob/master/build_readme.py&quot;&gt;build_readme.py&lt;/a&gt; which does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hits the GitHub GraphQL API to retrieve the latest release for every one of my 300+ repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hits my blog‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/atom/entries/&quot;&gt;full entries Atom feed&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the most recent posts (using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; Python library)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hits my TILs website‚Äôs Datasette API running &lt;a href=&quot;https://til.simonwillison.net/til?sql=select+title%2C+url%2C+created_utc+from+til+order+by+created_utc+desc+limit+5&quot;&gt;this SQL query&lt;/a&gt; to return the latest TIL links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It then turns the results from those various sources into a markdown list of links and replaces commented blocks in the README that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- recent_releases starts --&amp;gt;
...
&amp;lt;!-- recent_releases ends --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole script is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/simonw/blob/master/build_readme.py&quot;&gt;less than 150 lines of Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GitHub GraphQL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bunch of experience working with GitHub‚Äôs regular REST APIs, but for this project I decided to go with their newer &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/v4/&quot;&gt;GraphQL API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to show the most recent ‚Äúreleases‚Äù for all of my projects. I have over 300 GitHub repositories now, and only a portion of them use the releases feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using REST, I would have to make over 300 API calls to figure out which ones have releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With GraphQL, I can do this instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;query {
  viewer {
    repositories(first: 100, privacy: PUBLIC) {
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
      nodes {
        name
        releases(last:1) {
          totalCount
          nodes {
            name
            publishedAt
            url
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query returns the most recent release (&lt;code&gt;last:1&lt;/code&gt;) for each of the first 100 of my public repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can paste it into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/&quot;&gt;GitHub GraphQL explorer&lt;/a&gt; to run it against your own profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs just one catch: pagination. I have more than 100 repos but their GraphQL can only return 100 nodes at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paginate, you need to request the &lt;code&gt;endCursor&lt;/code&gt; and then pass that as the &lt;code&gt;after:&lt;/code&gt; parameter for the next request. I wrote up how to do this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/master/github/graphql-pagination-python.md&quot;&gt;this TIL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Next steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm pretty happy with this as a first attempt at automating my profile. There‚Äôs something extremely satsifying about having a GitHub profile that self-updates itself using GitHub Actions‚Äîit feels appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs so much more stuff I could add to this: my tweets, my sidebar blog links, maybe even download statistics from PyPI. I‚Äôll see what takes my fancy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a size limit on the README that is displayed on the profile page, so deciding how much information is appropriate is appears to be mainly a case of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building these automated profile pages is pretty easy, so I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what kind of things other nerds come up with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lt. Col. Randy &quot;Laz&quot; Gordon is an accomplished test pilot, engineer, and F-22 Raptor squadron commander who lent his expertise about all things aviation, and especially about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/32594/this-slow-motion-footage-of-an-f-22-maneuvering-is-mesmerizing&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;F-22's incredible fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; flight control system, to students taking &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-687-private-pilot-ground-school-january-iap-2019/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT's Private Pilot Ground School&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. His lecture is astonishingly accessible considering the complexities of the systems and concepts he describes and will give anyone a remarkable appreciation for just how incredible the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/18886/watch-this-f-22-raptor-execute-a-mind-blowing-inverted-summersault-at-altitude&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;super-maneuverable Raptor's&lt;/a&gt;flight control system really is.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon covers so much ground in his talk. He talks about the constant tension between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29218/these-images-of-an-f-22-raptors-crumbling-radar-absorbent-skin-are-fascinating&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;low-observability (stealth)&lt;/a&gt; and aerodynamics that resulted in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/27309/the-only-man-who-flew-both-the-f-22-and-the-yf-23-on-why-the-yf-23-lost&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;F-22's design&lt;/a&gt;, the massive loads the Raptor's powerful flight control system and its huge control surfaces have to instantly counteract, how supersonic flight requires unique flight control concepts, and even how permanent magnetic generators keep power running to the F-22's flight controls just by having the engines windmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is truly an astonishing amount of information in this presentation and it also acts as a great primer for anyone who is new to the concept of fly-by-wire flight control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other interesting tidbits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raptor pilots make sure their hands are off the flight controls and visible when ground crews are working around a running jet because one touch of the stick could cause the 4,000psi hydraulic system to send a control surface into deflection which can decapitate a ground crewman.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the F-22's high altitude capabilities, partially a product of its thrust vectoring capabilities, are known, Gordon notes the aircraft flies at altitudes from 60,000-65,000 feet.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He describes the pressure-sensitive sidestick control concept, which moves less than a half-inch, very well. The concept was pioneered by the F-16, with the YF-16's sidestick not moving at all before changes were made.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flight controls page on the F-22's multi-function-display is really well described here. The level of automation and simple symbology to describe complex issues is remarkable.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The F-22 knows it is about to take off and automatically reconfigures the plane for departure. It does the same upon touchdown.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple other automation flight logic modes, in which the flight control system sets to totally different parameters, exist. This is not uncommon on other fly-by-wire aircraft, like airliners, but the F-22's huge flight envelope makes them far more pronounced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a mode for aerial refueling to give the jet the best fine handling behind the tanker. ¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In aerial combat mode, you put pressure on the stick and it locks in a G-rate for a turn and stays there even if you take your hand off the stick.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When landing, it goes into a pitch command mode, where the pilot simply directs the pitch of the aircraft and it stays there.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large number of limiters are used to make sure the jet is not capable of being structurally overloaded and it even automatically unloads &lt;em&gt;individual parts&lt;/em&gt; of the aircraft during certain maneuvers by using flight control surfaces non-traditionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an F-22 drops a weapon, namely a 1,000lb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/10046/usaf-reaper-drones-can-finally-drop-gps-guided-joint-direct-attack-munitions&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JDAM&lt;/a&gt;, fuel automatically sloshes forward to maintain center of gravity. There is no fuel panel on the jet to command this, it is all part of the control logic.¬†&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the whole video for yourself below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is not formally talked about in the presentation, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/15413/the-future-of-stealth-is-in-morphing-wing-technology-will-the-b-21-feature-it&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we have discussed in the past&lt;/a&gt;, low-observability is also factored into flight control systems on stealthy aircraft. This would be yet another layer to the F-22's flight control programming.&lt;/p&gt;
