&lt;p name=&quot;1df8&quot; id=&quot;1df8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This article is an updated review of tools and software that I use to run my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;live coding stream&lt;/a&gt; each Sunday. If you’re interested in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lessons-from-my-first-year-of-live-coding-on-twitch-41a32e2f41c1&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lessons-from-my-first-year-of-live-coding-on-twitch-41a32e2f41c1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original article&lt;/a&gt;, which offers some advice outside of tools and software, feel free to read it as well! When I wrote the original post, it was intended to be a “lessons learned” post, and I didn’t expect folks to use it as a real guide. Reflecting upon that, I’m going to share my current setup with more attention to detail this time, as I still get questions on a weekly basis from folks looking for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f45d&quot; id=&quot;f45d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A reminder that this is not intended to be a “get started” guide, rather it’s written to share how one particular established streamer runs their show. Keep in mind that everyone runs theirs differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1fa9&quot; id=&quot;1fa9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ll breakdown everything I do and use into sections for easier consumption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;891d&quot; id=&quot;891d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8baa&quot; id=&quot;8baa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Stream design in OBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3e78&quot; id=&quot;3e78&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The thing where I’m not capturing all of my desktop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3672&quot; id=&quot;3672&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Technical settings in OBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7ac5&quot; id=&quot;7ac5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Twitch channel page design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e680&quot; id=&quot;e680&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;15f5&quot; id=&quot;15f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;A caveat:&lt;/strong&gt; I stream on macOS, so there is going to be a bias towards tools and techniques for this operating system. Most tools mentioned by gaming streamers are Windows focused, so I want to share how I stream effectively on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7b92&quot; id=&quot;7b92&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;29f5&quot; id=&quot;29f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Not much has changed, but I’ll list the hardware I use below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5c1f&quot; id=&quot;5c1f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The decisions I made around each item are based upon finding gear that is not too expensive, but still had good reviews online when I researched. I’m simply not interested in the “best of the best”, as I believe that hardware can only do so much for your stream. You do you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4366&quot; id=&quot;4366&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;This is my desk these days (I upgraded from my $30 IKEA table to an Uplift motorised standing desk):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;4f82&quot; id=&quot;4f82&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Stream design in OBS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2ac8&quot; id=&quot;2ac8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://obsproject.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Open Broadcasting Software&lt;/a&gt; to composite my audio and video for streaming to Twitch. There are other packages out there, but I started with this one and still prefer it after trying a couple of other options out briefly. OBS has been solid for me since I began streaming over two and a half years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d324&quot; id=&quot;d324&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A few people have asked me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streamlabs OBS&lt;/a&gt; (SLOBS), however because I stream on macOS as an operating system SLOBS is not available to me as an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0427&quot; id=&quot;0427&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s dig a little deeper into how I have OBS set up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8c6b&quot; id=&quot;8c6b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My OBS scenes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ea83&quot; id=&quot;ea83&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I meticulously organise my scenes in order to make them easy to manage and update. I name everything with prefixes, and delete any sources within them that I am no longer using. I have four main scenes that I use: Standby, Self, Desktop, and Offline. I’ll detail each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;58aa&quot; id=&quot;58aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Standby scene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9a10&quot; id=&quot;9a10&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This scene contains an image telling my stream viewers that I’m about to start. A scrolling text box was added to show that the stream is not “frozen” or buffering. A small comforting detail for those waiting. I often also ensure my music is playing in the background too. The illustration is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emily Griffin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*zw5r8pIRLNZ08WbAP3tRaA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1199&quot; data-height=&quot;1074&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*zw5r8pIRLNZ08WbAP3tRaA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zw5r8pIRLNZ08WbAP3tRaA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b64&quot; id=&quot;1b64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Offline scene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e06&quot; id=&quot;0e06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Similar to the Standby scene, this contains an image and nothing else. I switch to it when my stream is ending in a few seconds, and I’m getting ready to stop everything on the OBS side. My Twitch offline poster uses the same image, so it’s seamless on the channel when the livestream stops. The illustration is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emily Griffin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;6189&quot; id=&quot;6189&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Self scene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b67c&quot; id=&quot;b67c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I call this the “self” or “selfie” scene mostly because it shows myself in most of the video frame (right). I use this scene whenever I want to chit-chat with my viewers candidly (say if a test suite is running and we’re waiting), to open the stream, and also when I’m running through the “show and tell” segment of my stream, so that I can show items up close. I include a chat stream on the left as well, so that the conversation context is not missing should I choose to share this video somewhere other than on Twitch. The chat box is a widget offered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c0b1&quot; id=&quot;c0b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;How it looks live:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*LnNvp77mhXcWpvC5tLeqag.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-height=&quot;280&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LnNvp77mhXcWpvC5tLeqag.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;094f&quot; id=&quot;094f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is by far the most involved and complicated scene I use! It’s the one that is used for the majority of each stream. It has a lot of pieces, but on a basic level it shows my desktop ie. what I’m working on, a webcam feed of me, and a chat box so that context is preserved in the videos when viewed off the Twitch platform. The chat box also serves as an indicator to folks as to the stream delay and how long it takes for me to see and respond their chat message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*qKpJW1jrJ9TwyQsUxaWfZQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1199&quot; data-height=&quot;1074&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*qKpJW1jrJ9TwyQsUxaWfZQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qKpJW1jrJ9TwyQsUxaWfZQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ccfa&quot; id=&quot;ccfa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Here is a list of everything in this scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;f43c&quot; id=&quot;f43c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Header and footer.&lt;/strong&gt; These show details about viewer interactions, the temperature of my study, what music is playing, and my social media handles. I will explain these in more detail later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;808d&quot; id=&quot;808d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Desktop capture.&lt;/strong&gt; I only capture a portion of my entire screen, so that I can have private areas dedicated to managing and moderating my stream live. More on this later. I use vim on stream for my code editor as it looks nice and clean / minimal when side by side with the other parts of the scene layout. In the friendliest tone possible, I literally don’t care what code editor you use, and I don’t care what you think about my choice. If you’re interested, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noopkat/dotfiles&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/noopkat/dotfiles&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my dotfiles are on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2a9f&quot; id=&quot;2a9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Chat box.&lt;/strong&gt; I use an overlay widget for this, offered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;. It’s added via a ‘browser source’ within OBS. I have taken the time to style the chat box to match the aesthetics of my stream overall. The colours and font also match my code editor theme, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://draculatheme.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://draculatheme.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dracula&lt;/a&gt; and Inconsolata. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@suzhinton/customizing-your-livestream-chat-widget-2ff9de49e83f&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@suzhinton/customizing-your-livestream-chat-widget-2ff9de49e83f&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I wrote an article on how I did this&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know more detail. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pixelmator&lt;/a&gt; to draw the blue frame that appears around the chat box, and then imported that as an image source into OBS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d722&quot; id=&quot;d722&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Webcam capture.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s fun to watch a stream featuring the person who is streaming, as it builds more intimacy with viewers. You can see me laughing at your joke, or cursing at a bug I’m encountering in my code. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pixelmator&lt;/a&gt; to draw the blue frame around the webcam source, and then imported that as an image source into OBS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5f07&quot; id=&quot;5f07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Stream alerts.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever someone follows my channel, subscribes, hosts me, or cheers Bits, I want to celebrate that moment. In order to do this, I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt; Alert Box overlay widget imported as a browser source within OBS. In a nutshell, it plays an animation over the top of the stream with the person’s Twitch name in it. I have this source as the very top layer within the scene so that it when it shows an alert, everyone can see it clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;eac7&quot; id=&quot;eac7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Stream Events.&lt;/strong&gt; The alerts mentioned above are momentary, so I have the last 5 events listed in another &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt; widget called Event List. This is really not super necessary and doesn’t add much, so I’m thinking of removing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ef79&quot; id=&quot;ef79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;‘Secret’ overlay.&lt;/strong&gt; This is an image sized and positioned to cover up the desktop capture region of this scene. I use it whenever I have to do something private on my stream, such as rotating API keys, or entering one time passwords on websites. It is set to hidden by default, and I have it linked to a keyboard shortcut to toggle its visibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;cbe8&quot; id=&quot;cbe8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;How it looks live:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8987&quot; id=&quot;8987&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The adorable ‘secret’ illustration is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emily Griffin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d2d2&quot; id=&quot;d2d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You might have also noticed that I have a bunch of scenes showing in the OBS screenshots I have been sharing. There is a very handy tip that I want to share with you which is to use ‘child scenes’ within your main scenes, which OBS allows you to do. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;224e&quot; id=&quot;224e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There’ll be certain sources that you’ll want to group together as one unit, and the easiest method to do this is to create a new scene for them. Doing this will give you two major advantages — you can reuse the sources as a group in multiple scenes without having to duplicate individual sources one by one, and also when you update the child scene, all of your main scenes that use it will instantly get those updates at once. You can also drag and position multiple sources at once if they’re contained in a child scene together. Child scenes aren’t different from main scenes as far as OBS is concerned — I’m just calling them this to differentiate them from each other in functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0500&quot; id=&quot;0500&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My header and footer child scenes look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8144&quot; id=&quot;8144&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pixelmator&lt;/a&gt; to design the header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa8d&quot; id=&quot;fa8d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here is a list of everything in these two scenes and how I do the magical live updating text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;fea8&quot; id=&quot;fea8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Heart / musical note emoji png image sources for aesthetic reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e404&quot; id=&quot;e404&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Live text labels for last follower, last subscriber, and last donation. I run a desktop app from &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt; called “Stream Labels”, which writes each individual stat from your stream to a text file, continually updating upon new stats. When you create a text source in OBS in your scene, you can configure the source to read (and live update) from a text file. I point OBS at the correct text file for each label I’ve chosen to show. It’s a bit tedious to set up, but doing this in a child scene makes this a set and forget endeavor if you want to show them in every scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2031&quot; id=&quot;2031&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The music playing text label is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/noopkat/ea98f5a6ef197e636394ff7b270a16a0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/noopkat/ea98f5a6ef197e636394ff7b270a16a0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;custom AppleScript I wrote&lt;/a&gt; to regularly dump the currently playing song in iTunes to a text file. I set it up to run as a launchd daemon. It’s shown in OBS with the same text file source method as the other stream labels explained above. If you want to know why I use iTunes or how I find and choose my music, I cover that later on in this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2207&quot; id=&quot;2207&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The study temperature text label was a joke back when my study would get really hot in the summers of NYC. I was visibly sweating and my coding ability suffered as the room would grow hotter during each stream. I did this with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noopkat/study-temp&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/noopkat/study-temp&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;browser app that I made&lt;/a&gt; that shows telemetry being sent from a micro-controller sitting on my desk. I am using this web page in OBS as a browser source, but it could also very easily just be another daemon writing to a text file. I should probably make time to convert it one day. If you want to know more about the micro-controller and sensors used, hit me up as that’s a whole other thing not relevant here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;91dd&quot; id=&quot;91dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The webcam and chat box child scenes look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b618&quot; id=&quot;b618&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Another trick you might have noticed is I have created a couple of empty scenes named ‘ — — — — ‘ to act as separators for my scene list. It’s silly but it works really well to separate your main scenes from your child scenes. I have prefixed the names of my main scenes with ‘scene: ‘ and the child scenes are prefixed with ‘group: ‘ so that I can identify them very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3982&quot; id=&quot;3982&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I have use handy prefixes on the names of all of my sources. This just makes them easier to spot by type and makes everything look neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c924&quot; id=&quot;c924&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is all very optional! You don’t have to over architect your scenes in OBS. But I found that these pro tips have really helped me stay organised in OBS. It’s pretty easy to make a mess when you’re first playing around with scenes and sources. Be as organised or disorganised as you want to be — I’m not judging you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;315a&quot; id=&quot;315a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The thing where I’m not capturing all of my desktop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4f0c&quot; id=&quot;4f0c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I don’t capture all of my desktop like a lot of streamers do. This is for one specific reason — I only want to use one monitor screen. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f077&quot; id=&quot;f077&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For a couple of reasons, I have found it to be challenging to use an additional monitor screen to monitor Twitch chat messages, keep an eye on new follow events, etc. My peripheral vision only helps me so much, so having to remember to watch an additional screen while trying to focus on my code showing on my main monitor is a struggle. When I experimented with this setup, I just didn’t look over at the other monitor as often as I should to keep up on viewer activity. I also noticed that every time I looked over to acknowledge a new follower or a funny chat message, my face would be turned away from the webcam, which breaks the personal connection with the viewers I was talking to. It looked kinda disconnected and strange. Imagine if someone physically turned their body away from you every time they talked to you in real life. It feels awkward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dd26&quot; id=&quot;dd26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Capturing only part of my desktop did not make things feel squished, and allowed me to keep all of those viewer activity helpers close enough for me to notice and read very quickly. Your milage may vary, and almost no other streamer agrees with me on this, but this is what works really well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;13eb&quot; id=&quot;13eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So what do I have in the ‘secret’ area of my desktop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;3d3c&quot; id=&quot;3d3c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Twitch chat, popped out into a separate browser window&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;72f2&quot; id=&quot;72f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My ideal setup would use one of those ultra-Wide monitors so that I have more room in the non-capture zone, but this is fine for now. A girl can dream, and maybe even budget for a new monitor soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1bed&quot; id=&quot;1bed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My technical settings within OBS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e11e&quot; id=&quot;e11e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’m going to list the important video and output settings that I have found success with below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e695&quot; id=&quot;e695&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Video settings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;li name=&quot;3a47&quot; id=&quot;3a47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Do not rescale output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a494&quot; id=&quot;a494&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Rate Control: CBR (Twitch performs better with consistent vs. variable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0be0&quot; id=&quot;0be0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Bitrate: 2000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4338&quot; id=&quot;4338&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Keyframe interval: 0&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li name=&quot;6395&quot; id=&quot;6395&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Tune: (none)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;8c43&quot; id=&quot;8c43&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;So why the low output resolution and bitrate, I hear you ask? The answer is very blunt — your stream is not about you, it’s about your viewers. Some of your viewers do not have blazing fast, modern internet connections to watch you in crisp high resolution. I was born and raised in Australia, so I am painfully aware of this and remember waiting 20 minutes just to finish pushing code to a remote SVN service. As long as they can read your code on your video feed, you’re good. Keep things as low as possible in order to prevent buffering delays and intermittent dropped frames on your side as well. Your viewers will thank you by sticking around and returning each stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8efa&quot; id=&quot;8efa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Audio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f6c9&quot; id=&quot;f6c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;This one is going to get complicated. I am streaming on macOS, which introduces some snags when working with audio sources in OBS. If you use Windows to stream — feel free to disregard this entire section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc2e&quot; id=&quot;bc2e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The TLDR is: if you want music and other desktop sounds to play on your stream, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Soundflower&lt;/a&gt; for a really pared back solution to get started with. Soundflower will allow you to use a virtual device to route your desktop sounds to. OBS can then use the Soundflower device as an audio source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b61c&quot; id=&quot;b61c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I personally have a more comprehensive setup, where I route audio to several virtual devices in order to use OBS as an audio mixer for my needs. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;It is entirely optional, please do not feel that this is at all necessary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dfdb&quot; id=&quot;dfdb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Loopback&lt;/a&gt;, which is an audio routing tool that uses software only to help you move audio through virtual devices from various sources. I use two virtual devices in Loopback; one for my music (iTunes), and another for the sound effects I sometimes play on my stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40d5&quot; id=&quot;40d5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The music related device pipes the music playing from iTunes into a virtual device I call ‘Twitch Music’. Here is a screengrab of what it looks like in Loopback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Ag2sN8QPOeO5T69jwZ9mdQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1112&quot; data-height=&quot;612&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Ag2sN8QPOeO5T69jwZ9mdQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Ag2sN8QPOeO5T69jwZ9mdQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e264&quot; id=&quot;e264&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The sound effect related device captures sounds from my Chrome browser windows (Streamlabs alert sounds are the main thing I’m trying to capture) and is also a simple ‘pass-thru’ — it’ll accept any input audio you give to it. I cover how I play my sound effects via this pass-thru in the automation section of this post later on. However, here is a screengrab of what it looks like in Loopback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ba28&quot; id=&quot;ba28&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In OBS I set up an audio source for each of these virtual devices, including Soundflower. Soundflower is capturing the remaining sound that isn’t music or a sound effect (such as error sounds from my computer programs, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;10a2&quot; id=&quot;10a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here is a screengrab of the audio settings in OBS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;baa6&quot; id=&quot;baa6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Setting up these sources separately allows me to control each one individually, just like a mixer in real life. I can individually adjust the volume of my mic, music, sound effects, and misc. desktop sounds at will, which is really handy to have as a feature when streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7408&quot; id=&quot;7408&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s the mixer interface in OBS to show you what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;bd77&quot; id=&quot;bd77&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Last but not least — all of this does not help me to also hear what I need to hear while streaming. I do not want to hear the music, but I do want to hear computer error sounds, and also Streamlabs follow and subscription alerts which help me to notice them and call them out. This is where I use the Audio MIDI Setup application (built into macOS) to solve this problem. I create a multi-output device, and check the boxes to include the audio sources I do want to hear. Just before I stream, I switch to this multi-output device as the output source for my laptop’s audio. This routes the helpful sounds to me, and filters out the sounds I do not want. I call this device ‘Twitch Personal’ so that I remember it’s for my own local use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ea40&quot; id=&quot;ea40&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;If you want to conduct remote video calls with fellow programmers to “pair” with them on your stream, you will absolutely need to do this, or you won’t be able to hear them speaking (only your viewers will hear them).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e8e4&quot; id=&quot;e8e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I randomly source royalty free, creative commons licensed music from sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://freemusicarchive.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://freemusicarchive.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Free Music Archive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bandcamp.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://bandcamp.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p name=&quot;d6a0&quot; id=&quot;d6a0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I use iTunes to play the music on stream because it supports AppleScript, and I have written scripts that automate the music and the song identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a8b5&quot; id=&quot;a8b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I have re-designed my Twitch channel page since I wrote my original post about streaming. The objectives were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e958&quot; id=&quot;e958&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bring a more cohesive look and feel to my channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;71a8&quot; id=&quot;71a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Include myself in some of the assets to create a personal touch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;22b8&quot; id=&quot;22b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Make the channel page look friendly and unique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;2c3a&quot; id=&quot;2c3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I hired &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilywithcurls&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emily Griffin&lt;/a&gt; to create all of the illustrations, panel banners, and emotes that you see on my twitch channel page. It was 100% worth the investment. I knew of Emily because we ran in similar social circles, and I’d also seen her work online so I was certain that her style would be a great fit for that I wanted my channel to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7088&quot; id=&quot;7088&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Put some effort into your panels below the channel video frame. Potential new viewers will often visit your channel’s page when you’re offline, so having a good set of panels to describe your channel and letting them know when your next stream is sets a great first impression and is generally helpful for them when deciding whether to follow up when you’re live. They also help a lot when viewers stumble upon your stream when you’re live, and are not sure what you’re working on or what your stream is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;172f&quot; id=&quot;172f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Stream moderation and privacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;5d9d&quot; id=&quot;5d9d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;AutoMod&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e9b2&quot; id=&quot;e9b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Twitch has a feature called AutoMod, which is really helpful to have moderating your channel’s chat room. There is an entire moderation settings page on Twitch dedicated to different approaches you can use. Here are my main settings that I know to have made a positive difference to chat quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;6b86&quot; id=&quot;6b86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I have my AutoMod set to Level 4 (ie. a lot of moderation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7e20&quot; id=&quot;7e20&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I have a 4 second chat delay instated so that my human moderators (bless them I am not worthy) have a chance to remove any nasty or inappropriate content before everyone else sees it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7d83&quot; id=&quot;7d83&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;All folks wanting to leave chat messages need to have an email address registered with their account first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;96a9&quot; id=&quot;96a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;You have to have been following my channel for a minimum of 30 minutes before you’re allowed to chat in the chat room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;f72b&quot; id=&quot;f72b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;My chat rules are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b830&quot; id=&quot;b830&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Follow the Twitch Community Guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6379&quot; id=&quot;6379&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Be kind!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;b596&quot; id=&quot;b596&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Respect other humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0054&quot; id=&quot;0054&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Include everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ad91&quot; id=&quot;ad91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;No language bashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0d50&quot; id=&quot;0d50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Listen to the moderation team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;a0b8&quot; id=&quot;a0b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.nightbot.tv/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://beta.nightbot.tv/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nightbot&lt;/a&gt; for some of their moderation features, but have turned most of them off since Twitch introduced AutoMod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;73be&quot; id=&quot;73be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Human Mods ❤️&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8494&quot; id=&quot;8494&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I do not know what I’d do without my friendly and cherished human moderators. While not critical when first streaming, once you have built a meaningful following real people as moderators are very key. They are the backbone of the positive community that I have grown around my stream channel. I currently have 15 moderators officially. I’d hazard a guess that on average 3–5 of them are present during my streams, and it varies in numbers and the people depending on the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c02&quot; id=&quot;3c02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I won’t mention them here in fear of putting them on blast, but I want to thank them so much for their very hard and sometimes stressful work when weird / nasty stuff goes down (which is not super often, in all honestly and relief). My AutoMod settings are aggressively set to cut them some slack, and so they only need to step in if things get super weird ❤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e013&quot; id=&quot;e013&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Privacy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d22&quot; id=&quot;1d22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I try to keep a pretty locked down ship privacy-wise. Inevitably, I’ll do something by accident that I shouldn’t have from time to time, but what’s most important is that I mitigate the risks as much as possible, and plan for when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5af0&quot; id=&quot;5af0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I use my secret blocker when needing to enter plain text secrets anywhere in my code as I mentioned earlier in this article. If I accidentally show a secret, such as running git diff or cat on a file I shouldn’t have, I immediately rotate the secret / API key and move on after having a laugh at myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1ef6&quot; id=&quot;1ef6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I am also aware that there are certain techniques folks might use to phish personal information from me on stream. This can be something as innocent as sending me an Amazon product link. On that Amazon product link page, my shipping address zip code is displayed if I’m logged in. This is just one example, but there are many ways for me to be baited into showing details I did not volunteer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b0d9&quot; id=&quot;b0d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One option is to have a separate browser profile where I’m logged out of everything. In all honesty this hasn’t been a super practical option for me. So instead, I use a browser extension called &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en&quot; data-href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Block Site&lt;/a&gt; to schedule blocking of certain websites during the time window that I am streaming in. This extension is actually designed for productivity reasons, but it’s been helpful for me to have peace of mind. I add sites to it regularly when I think of them. I have all of the major shopping/ordering sites covered, as well as email accounts, and the settings pages of many technical tools and websites I use online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1042&quot; id=&quot;1042&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If I’m worried about the contents of a link posted in chat, I just don’t click on it, and ask one of my mods to check it out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4f5&quot; id=&quot;f4f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you want a more detailed discussion, I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSpFT3tZzyM&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSpFT3tZzyM&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy and security while streaming with Tanya Janca on her DevSlop channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5de8&quot; id=&quot;5de8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8aab&quot; id=&quot;8aab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In truth, I don’t have a lot of automation set up to streamline the streaming process, but I’ll outline what I do have because it helps a lot. A few of these automated processes have been mentioned in previous sections of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;b21e&quot; id=&quot;b21e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chat automation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a973&quot; id=&quot;a973&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.nightbot.tv/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://beta.nightbot.tv/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nightbot&lt;/a&gt; not just for moderation, but for setting up special chat commands that will autoreply with commonly asked questions while I’m streaming. This saves me a lot of time and distraction when folks drop in asking things such as “what are you working on?”, “what is that terminal theme you’re using?”, and “can you share your dotfiles?”. FYI, the chat commands set up for these questions are ‘!whatamidoing’, ‘!editor’, and ‘!dotfiles’ respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a16&quot; id=&quot;5a16&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here is what it looks like in the chat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*exDQjeCqvMKVH3O1J3nCMA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;351&quot; data-height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*exDQjeCqvMKVH3O1J3nCMA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1c33&quot; id=&quot;1c33&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;518d&quot; id=&quot;518d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I have keyboard shortcuts set up for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b106&quot; id=&quot;b106&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Switching to specific scenes in OBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d9cb&quot; id=&quot;d9cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Toggling the ‘secret blocker’ on the desktop scene in OBS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8418&quot; id=&quot;8418&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Playing sound effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;43c6&quot; id=&quot;43c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Running an automated setup script before streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;587c&quot; id=&quot;587c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt; for all of these shortcuts, including sending shortcuts directly to OBS because there’s a global keyboard shortcut bug in OBS on macOS so this is how I get around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da06&quot; id=&quot;da06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Remember earlier where I detailed a separate virtual device for sending sound effects to? Here is an example of a macro to do that in Keyboard Maestro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*icdYqfNhEjWSEQA9v75gLw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1044&quot; data-height=&quot;629&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*icdYqfNhEjWSEQA9v75gLw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*icdYqfNhEjWSEQA9v75gLw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;43f0&quot; id=&quot;43f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;One giant AppleScript&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5dca&quot; id=&quot;5dca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I recently captured the entire pre-stream setup process into one AppleScript (and some companion bash scripts). This script is a true time saver every Sunday morning since I made it. This AppleScript does the following for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;9af5&quot; id=&quot;9af5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Opens all of the browser windows I need (streamlabs alerts/events, Twitch chat, etc) after minimising my personal browser window with all my private tabs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a910&quot; id=&quot;a910&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Opens a new iTerm custom window arrangement, perfectly sized and aligned for my Twitch stream, after minimising my personal iTerm window with my day-to-day work in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5ed3&quot; id=&quot;5ed3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Switches my audio output source to ‘Twitch Personal’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3281&quot; id=&quot;3281&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Starts up iTunes, positions it in the bottom right corner, and starts playing my custom Twitch playlist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c621&quot; id=&quot;c621&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Starts up the Stream Labels app and minimises it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0960&quot; id=&quot;0960&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Pops up a dialog asking to update my !whatamidoing Nighbot command reply content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7b5d&quot; id=&quot;7b5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The last step which updates my Nightbot command does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;48de&quot; id=&quot;48de&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hits the Nightbot API and gets the last command reply I used from last week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4d09&quot; id=&quot;4d09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Pre-populates the input field on the dialog with the last reply it fetched, and if I want to change it I can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;90dd&quot; id=&quot;90dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Once I hit ‘Save’, it hits the Nighbot API again to set the command reply to the new one I typed in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;126a&quot; id=&quot;126a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;It’ll then show a macOS notification with the JSON of the Nightbot API response so I can check if it worked ok.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;36e0&quot; id=&quot;36e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I assign a keyboard shortcut to run the AppleScript in Keyboard Maestro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*9tu8Jv7TK7J01I7Nciy8GA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2132&quot; data-height=&quot;1210&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*9tu8Jv7TK7J01I7Nciy8GA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9tu8Jv7TK7J01I7Nciy8GA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7313&quot; id=&quot;7313&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Here is the Nightbot prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;bf18&quot; id=&quot;bf18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And the response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;4a4e&quot; id=&quot;4a4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And I have hosted all of my scripts including this one in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noopkat/twitch-scripts&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/noopkat/twitch-scripts&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repository on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d40c&quot; id=&quot;d40c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Round Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0479&quot; id=&quot;0479&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I have collected all of the tools and resources mentioned in this post into one big list for your convenience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1c17&quot; id=&quot;1c17&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9591&quot; id=&quot;9591&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I hope this has been informative for you. I have tried to share as much detail as possible and address the most common questions I get about my setup. If you have additional questions, let me know. Just keep in mind — this is what works for me. What works for you may be entirely different. Happy streaming!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ICANN Calls for DNSSEC for All Domains Following Domain Hijacking Attempts</title>
<link>https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2019-02-22-en</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2019-02-22-en</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES – 21 February 2019 – The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) believes that there is an ongoing and significant risk to key parts of the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of increasing reports of malicious activity targeting the DNS infrastructure, ICANN is calling for full deployment of the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) across all unsecured domain names. The organization also reaffirms its commitment to engage in collaborative efforts to ensure the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet’s global identifier systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of many entities engaged in the decentralized management of the Internet, ICANN is specifically responsible for coordinating the top-most level of the DNS to ensure its stable and secure operation and universal resolvability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 15 February 2019, in response to reports of attacks against key parts of the DNS infrastructure, ICANN offered a &lt;a href=&quot;/news/announcement-2019-02-15-en&quot;&gt;checklist&lt;/a&gt; of recommended security precautions for members of the domain name industry, registries, registrars, resellers, and related others, to proactively take to protect their systems, their customers’ systems and information reachable via the DNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/a-deep-dive-on-the-recent-widespread-dns-hijacking-attacks/&quot;&gt;Public reports&lt;/a&gt; indicate that there is a pattern of multifaceted attacks utilizing different methodologies. Some of the attacks target the DNS, in which unauthorized changes to the delegation structure of domain names are made, replacing the addresses of intended servers with addresses of machines controlled by the attackers. This particular type of attack, which targets the DNS, only works when DNSSEC is not in use. DNSSEC is a technology developed to protect against such changes by digitally 'signing' data to assure its validity. Although DNSSEC cannot solve all forms of attack against the DNS, when it is used, unauthorized modification to DNS information can be detected, and users are blocked from being misdirected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN has long recognized the importance of DNSSEC and is calling for full deployment of the technology across all domains. Although this will not solve the security problems of the Internet, it aims to assure that Internet users reach their desired online destination by helping to prevent so-called “man in the middle” attacks where a user is unknowingly re-directed to a potentially malicious site. DNSSEC complements other technologies, such as Transport Layer Security (most typically used in HTTPS) that protect the end user/domain communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the coordinator of the top-most level of the DNS, ICANN is in the position to help mitigate and detect DNS-related risks, and to facilitate key discussions together with its partners. The organization believes that all members of the domain name system ecosystem must work together to produce better tools and policies to secure the DNS and other critical operations of the Internet. To facilitate these efforts, ICANN is planning an event for the Internet community to address DNS protection: The first is an open session during the upcoming ICANN64 public meeting on 9-14 March 2019, in Kobe, Japan.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we learn more information, updates may be provided. For information about ICANN64, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://meetings.icann.org/kobe64&quot;&gt;https://meetings.icann.org/kobe64&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About ICANN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICANN's mission is to help ensure a stable, secure, and unified global Internet. To reach another person on the Internet, you need to type an address – a name or a number – into your computer or other device. That address must be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN helps coordinate and support these unique identifiers across the world. ICANN was formed in 1998 as a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with a community of participants from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft’s HoloLens 2: a $3,500 mixed-reality headset for the factory</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;iCUeu7&quot;&gt;I am in a tiny room in a basement somewhere in Microsoft’s Redmond, Washington headquarters, wearing an early version of the HoloLens 2 headset. In front of me is a very real ATV, which is missing a bolt. Not quite at the corner of my vision — but certainly off to the side — I see a glowing indicator pointing to a bucket of the right bolts. I walk over, bend down to look more closely at the shelf, and grab one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1w45dp&quot;&gt;Back at the ATV, a holographic set of instructions hovers above it, telling me what to do and pointing to the exact spot where the bolt needs to go. After a couple of minutes, I’ve successfully fixed the thing — guided by holograms. I tap a holographic button on the guide to close out the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jl8vl5&quot;&gt;This sort of demo is quickly becoming commonplace for tech journalists like myself. But if you read the previous description closely, you’ll find that there are three key pieces of technical innovation hidden in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kwJn52&quot;&gt;Here they are: I saw a hologram off to the side because the field of view in which they can appear is much larger than before. I bent down and didn’t worry about an awkward headset shifting around because it was better balanced on my head. I pushed a button just by pushing a button because I didn’t need to learn a complicated gesture to operate the HoloLens 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EYlRGa&quot;&gt;Those three things might not seem all that remarkable to you, but that’s precisely the point. Microsoft needed to make the HoloLens feel much more natural if it really plans to get people to use it, and it has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HrOYju&quot;&gt;There’s one more unremarkably remarkable thing: even though it was just a demo, I was playing the part of a worker because that’s who the HoloLens 2 is exclusively designed for — workers, not consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;Ira55A&quot;&gt;The Microsoft HoloLens 2 is available for preorder today for $3,500, and it’s expected to ship later this year. However, Microsoft has decided that it is only going to sell to enterprise customers who want to deploy the headset to their workers. As of right now, Microsoft isn’t even announcing a developer kit version of the HoloLens 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hWUug0&quot;&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7868251/microsoft-hololens-hologram-hands-on-experience&quot;&gt;HoloLens we first saw demonstrated four years ago&lt;/a&gt;, the second version is better in nearly every important way. It’s more comfortable, it has a much larger field of view, and it’s better able to detect real physical objects in the room. It features new components like the Azure Kinect sensor, an ARM processor, eye-tracking sensors, and an entirely different display system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nQ1NII&quot;&gt;It has a couple of speakers, the visor flips up, and it can see what your hands are doing more accurately than before. There’s an 8-megapixel front-facing camera for video conferencing, it’s capable of full 6 degrees of tracking, and it also uses USB-C to charge. It is, in short, chock-full of new technology. But after four years, that should be no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;XINjwx&quot;&gt;The biggest complaint about the first HoloLens was simple: you only saw the holograms in a relatively small box, directly in front of you. Turn your head even a little, and they would disappear from your field of view. Worse, their edges would clip out of existence even when you were staring right at them. It was like looking at a digital world through a tiny rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Qxsq7z&quot;&gt;The HoloLens 2 has a field of view that’s twice as big as before. It doesn’t quite fill your entire field of vision — there’s still clipping — but it’s big enough now that you no longer feel constantly annoyed by a letterbox. Microsoft says that each eye has the equivalent of a 2K display in front of it, but it’s better to think of that as a metaphor than a precise spec. The exact spec is that it has a “holographic density of 47 pixels per degree,” which means that the pixel density is high enough to allow you to read 8-point font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PBRxjP&quot;&gt;Typically, when a tech product gets better specs like these, it happens through sheer force of technical iteration: faster processors, bigger batteries, more RAM, and so on. But that strategy wouldn’t have worked for the display on the HoloLens 2. It needed to get lighter, not heavier. So Microsoft had to completely change over to a different kind of display technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lj0z0b&quot;&gt;Lasers and mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;rbXfoe&quot;&gt;Laser-based displays have become the thing to do for computers on your face. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16966530/intel-vaunt-smart-glasses-announced-ar-video&quot;&gt;Intel’s Vaunt project&lt;/a&gt; used lasers, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18223593/focals-smart-glasses-north-review-specs-features-price&quot;&gt;North Focals smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; do, too. Although Microsoft is using some of the same basic components, it’s taken them in a different direction and gone much further in developing what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hBeAjs&quot;&gt;The lasers in the HoloLens 2 shine into a set of mirrors that oscillate as quickly as 54,000 cycles per second so the reflected light can paint a display. Those two pieces together form the basis of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) display. That’s all tricky to make, but the really tricky part for a MEMS display is getting the image that it paints into your eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AKZ03M&quot;&gt;One solution that companies like North have used is a holographic film on the lens to reflect the image directly into your retina. That has lots of drawbacks: a tiny display and low resolution, for two. But the truly problematic part is simply ensuring the display is aimed right into your eye. You have to be custom-fitted for the North glasses, and the image can disappear entirely if they’re misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;uvVx7D&quot;&gt;Microsoft doesn’t want any of those problems, so it turned to the same thing it used on the first HoloLens: waveguides. They’re the pieces of glass in front of your eye that are carefully etched so they can reflect the holograms in front of your eyes. The waveguides on the HoloLens 2 are lighter now because Microsoft is using two sandwiched glass plates instead of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nVP5YH&quot;&gt;When you put the whole system together — the lasers, the mirrors, and the waveguide — you can get a brighter display with a wider field of view that doesn’t have to be precisely aimed into your eyes to work. Zulfi Alam, general manager for Optics Engineering at Microsoft, contends that Microsoft is way out ahead with this system and that waveguides are definitely the way to go for mixed reality. “There’s no competition for the next two or three years that can come close this level of fidelity in the waveguides,” he argues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SBLH6q&quot;&gt;Do you want a wider field of view? Simple. Just increase the angle of the mirrors that reflect the laser light. A wider angle means a bigger image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;R1zrZj&quot;&gt;Do you want brighter images? Simple again. Lasers, not to put too fine a point on it, have light to spare. Of course, you have to deal with the fact that waveguides lose a ton of light, but the displays I saw were set to 500 nits and looked plenty bright to me. Microsoft thinks it could go much brighter in the final version, depending on the power draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FbVNub&quot;&gt;Do you want to see the holograms without getting specifically fitted for your headset? Simple yet again. The waveguide doesn’t require specific fitting or measurement. You can just put the headset on and get going. It also can sit far enough in front of your eyes to allow you to wear whatever glasses you need comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DDbiZa&quot;&gt;Simple, simple, simple, right? In truth, it’s devilishly complex. Microsoft had to create an entirely new etching system for the waveguides. It had to figure out how to direct light to the right place in the waveguides nearly photon by photon. “We are simulating every photon that comes from the laser,” Alam says. The light from the lasers isn’t just reflected; it’s split apart in multiple colors and through multiple “pupils” in the display system and then “reconstituted” into the right spot on the waveguides. “Each photon is calculated where it’s expected to go,” Alam says. That takes a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of computing power, so Microsoft had to develop custom silicon to do all of the calculations on where the photos would go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DrwT8k&quot;&gt;And though alignment is much easier with the waveguide, that doesn’t mean it’s perfect. That’s why there are two tiny cameras on the nose bridge, directed at your eyeballs. They will allow the HoloLens 2 to automatically measure the distance between your pupils and adjust the image accordingly. Those cameras will also allow the HoloLens 2 to vertically adjust the image if it gets tilted or if your eyes are not perfectly even. (They are not. Sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4VhXeJ&quot;&gt;A sort of free benefit of those cameras is that they can also scan your retinas to log you into the HoloLens 2 securely. It runs Windows, after all, and therefore it supports Windows Hello. They also track where you’re looking, which enables some new user interactions I’ll get to below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14249348/mems.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1551080730_8400_49471&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:14249348,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14249348/mems.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A MEMS mirror under a high-speed camera.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;K864PF&quot;&gt;Then there’s power: lasers, oscillating mirrors, and custom chips to handle the computing for all of that must chew through battery. But Alam tells me that even with all of that, it still manages to require less power than the alternative. The mirrors oscillate in resonance, so it takes less energy to move them, sort of like they’re the fastest metronomes ever. Lasers are also less lossy than LEDs, and custom silicon can be optimized to its specific task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UKGbnb&quot;&gt;”Our evolution is toward a form factor that is truly glasses,” Alam says, “and all these are significant steps in this journey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N3eR4o&quot;&gt;All that tech is impressive for sure, but I don’t want to oversell the image quality. What I was using wasn’t a finished product. I did see a tiny halo around some of the holograms, and they sometimes jumped around a bit. Most of the features based on the nose bridge eye scanners weren’t flipped on yet, either. Still, compared to the first HoloLens, what I saw crossed over the line from “cool demo I’d use for 20 minutes and then be annoyed” to “I could see people using this for a few hours if the software was really useful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WFQTgN&quot;&gt;But if you’re going to use a headset for “a few hours,” it needs to be comfortable enough to leave on in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;NSIJgy&quot;&gt;Comfort zone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;2iVAXI&quot;&gt;Here’s how you put the HoloLens 2 on: you put it on like a baseball cap, twist a knob on the back to tighten the headband, and then you’ll start seeing holograms. The end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Q6hXoN&quot;&gt;It’s much less fiddly than the last HoloLens or any other face-mounted display I’ve ever tried. Because of all the work on the display system, you can skip the extra “fuss with the position to make sure you can see the image” step. The body of the thing is simpler, too. It’s a single band that’s held on with minimal pressure on the back of your head and on your forehead. (There’s an optional top strap if you need it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IpKk92&quot;&gt;All of that is nice, but it’s pointless if the headset is uncomfortable to wear. And though I never had it on for more than a 20-minute stint, I think it will hold up for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;H96d2Y&quot;&gt;Microsoft has a “human factors” lab where it loves to show off its collection of dummy human heads and high-speed cameras. Carl Ledbetter, senior director of design for the Microsoft Device Design Team, walked me through all of the prototypes and material Microsoft tried to get into the final product. He explained how Microsoft experimented with different designs and materials, ultimately landing on carbon fiber to save weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;k69KnB&quot;&gt;”The reality is [we have to] fit kids, adults, men, women, and different ethnicities around the world. Everybody’s head is different,” he says. Microsoft has a database of around 600 heads tracking the shape of the cranium, eye depth, the size and relative position of the nose bridge, and other variations. Ledbetter’s team attached sensors to people’s necks to measure muscle strain, to make sure the center of gravity was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rTHo0s&quot;&gt;The result is that the HoloLens 2 has a more forgiving and flexible fit. It simply does a better job of accommodating basic, physical human realities. You can flip the visor up so it’s out of your field of view so you can make eye contact without removing the headset. The memory foam pad that rests on your forehead is removable and cleanable, and the thermals have been completely redesigned so heat is piped away from your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9rnxUW&quot;&gt;All of that really helps, but the most important thing Microsoft did was move the center of gravity right behind your ears instead of up by your eyes. The HoloLens 2 isn’t really much lighter than the original HoloLens. It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; lighter, though, because it’s balanced more naturally on your head. That balance makes a huge difference. The weight of it is less noticeable and should put less strain on your neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rvwfAH&quot;&gt;Ledbetter moved the weight by literally moving the heaviest part: the main processor and battery are now located in a module that sits on the back of the headset, with wires inside the headband running up to the display board and components in the front. That processor, by the way, is an ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon 850, and that’s important because it addresses another basic human reality: we hate when the battery dies, and we hate plugging stuff in. An ARM processor means it can have a smaller battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;4zI5Ap&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you’re going to be on battery, [it’s] hard to find a product that’s not running ARM today.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c1lEDt&quot;&gt;The original HoloLens ran on an Intel processor, and it ran Windows. Since then, Microsoft has done a ton of work to get Windows working well on ARM. Those efforts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128630/qualcomm-snapdragon-8cx-announcement-technology-summit-maui&quot;&gt;slowly coming to fruition on laptops&lt;/a&gt;, but Intel is still the order of the day on those machines where raw speed is usually more important to users than battery life. In general, there’s a tension with Intel. It’s not delivering the lower-power chips that mobile devices demand. Intel even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776668/intel-microsoft-surface-go-arm-processor-choice&quot;&gt;reportedly had to lobby Microsoft to keep the Surface Go&lt;/a&gt; on its chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dpStFQ&quot;&gt;So what about the HoloLens 2? Alex Kipman is the person in charge of the whole HoloLens project. He says that “ARM rules in battery-operated devices. The ARM decision became fairly easy. If you’re going to be on battery, [it’s] hard to find a product that’s not running ARM today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6S4l7q&quot;&gt;When I point out that there are plenty of Windows laptops running on batteries using Intel chips, he becomes blunter. “Intel doesn’t even have an SoC [system on chip] right now for these types of products that run on battery. They did have one, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/23/12602516/microsoft-hololens-holographic-processing-unit-specifications&quot;&gt;previous version [of the HoloLens] had Cherry Trail&lt;/a&gt;, which they discontinued. That decision is a no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kSxaqD&quot;&gt;For workers, not consumers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;G359mv&quot;&gt;The HoloLens 2 is only being sold to corporations, not to consumers. It’s designed for what Kipman calls “first-line workers,” people in auto shops, factory floors, operating rooms, and out in the field fixing stuff. It’s designed for people who work with their hands and find it difficult to integrate a computer or smartphone into their daily work. Kipman wants to replace the grease-stained Windows 2000 computer sitting in the corner of the workroom. It’s pretty much the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15988258/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-factories&quot;&gt;same decision Google made for Google Glass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zvXDrN&quot;&gt;“If you think about 7 billion people in the world, people like you and I — knowledge workers — are by far the minority,” he replies. To him, the workers who will use this are “maybe people that are fixing our jet propulsion engine. Maybe they are the people that are in some retail space. Maybe they’re the doctors that are operating on you in an operating room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OWWGWU&quot;&gt;He continues, saying it’s for “people that have been, in a sense, neglected or haven’t had access to technology [in their hands-on jobs] because PCs, tablets, phones don’t really lend themselves to those experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;iQdJkd&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m here to tell you that it’s still not a consumer product.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xGbxn0&quot;&gt;Fair enough. That’s completely in fitting with Microsoft’s new focus on serving corporate and enterprise needs instead of trying to crank out hit consumer products. That was one of my takeaways when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17324920/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-windows-10-build-2018&quot;&gt;interviewed CEO Satya Nadella last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it holds true today. As I wrote then, it’s “a different kind of Microsoft than what we’re used to thinking of. It’s a little less flashy, yes, but it has the benefit of being a lot more likely to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2el8td&quot;&gt;Besides, Kipman argues, even the HoloLens 2 isn’t good enough to be a real mass-market consumer technology product. “This is the best, highest watermark of what can be achieved in mixed reality and I’m here to tell you that it’s still not a consumer product,” he says, then continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DQhlUT&quot;&gt;Why is it not a consumer product? It’s not as immersive as you want it to be. It’s more than twice as immersive as the previous one, [but it’s] still not immersive enough for that consumer off the street to go use it. It’s still not comfortable enough … I would say that until these things are way more immersive than the most immersive product, way more comfortable than the most comfortable product, and at or under $1,000, I think people are kidding themselves in thinking that these products are ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fM9Woc&quot;&gt;Kipman says that Microsoft has not participated in the consumer hype cycle for these types of products. “We were not the company that hyped VR. We are certainly not the company that hyped AR. And since we merged the two into the mixed reality and AI efforts, we haven’t hyped either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UXpUYe&quot;&gt;That’s not exactly true. We have seen plenty of demos from Microsoft showing off games — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/17/8794971/microsoft-hololens-minecraft-project-xray-hands-on-e3-2015&quot;&gt;including &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — and other consumer applications for the HoloLens. So this move to the enterprise market is absolutely a pivot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jrQ4lV&quot;&gt;But it’s a pivot that’s part and parcel with Microsoft’s larger corporate strategy. And just because it’s no longer being positioned as a consumer product doesn’t mean that it’s not an important product — one that Microsoft appears to be committed to and is developing software for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;REPa36&quot;&gt;A better interface on your face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;74NLYT&quot;&gt;The first HoloLens required users to learn awkward gestures with names like “Air Tap” and “Bloom.” You had to make these really specific hand gestures because that’s all the first HoloLens’ sensors could detect and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4l4VjX&quot;&gt;The HoloLens 2 can detect and understand much more because of a new array of sensors for reading the room called the Azure Kinect. “Kinect” because that’s the brand for Microsoft’s cameras that can scan rooms, “Azure” because seemingly everything the company does these days is somehow connected to its cloud service and as a further signal that this is a business product, not an Xbox add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QPtywU&quot;&gt;“HoloLens 1 is just one big mesh. It’s like dropping a blanket over the real world,” Kipman says. “With HoloLens 2, we go from spatial mapping to semantic understanding of spaces. You understand what’s a couch, what is a human sitting on the couch, what’s the difference between a window and a wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Z8qo6E&quot;&gt;I can’t speak to how well Kinect is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; able to identify objects — Microsoft didn’t demo any of that for us — but it theoretically works because the Azure Kinect sees the room at a higher resolution and because it is hooked up to cloud services that help it figure out what things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ty41aT&quot;&gt;There’s one aspect where I can definitively say that the higher fidelity is real: it’s able to identify my hand and what it’s doing much more easily. It can track up to 25 points of articulation on both hands in space, which means that you shouldn’t need to use the Air Tap gesture to interact with holograms anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14249742/grabit.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1551080731_8445_49477&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:14249742,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14249742/grabit.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resizing a hologram with a natural gesture. Footage does not show actual Field of View.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9HyjIV&quot;&gt;In one demo, I paced around a room looking at various holograms that were set up on tables. As I reached my hands in, a box appeared around each one with little grab handles on the edges and corners. I could just reach in and grab the whole box and move the hologram around. I could also just grab one edge to rotate it, or two to resize it. When there was a button, I could stick my finger out and push it. I doubt that it’s accurate enough to, say, let you type on a virtual QWERTY keyboard, but it’s a big step up over the first generation, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MLWP4E&quot;&gt;Eye tracking also comes into play in how you interact with holograms. The HoloLens 2 can detect where you’re looking and use that information as a kind of user interface. There were demos where I just stared at a little bubble to make it pop into holographic fireworks, but the most useful one was an auto-scroller. The closer to the bottom of the page I got, the faster the words scrolled, but then it stopped when I looked back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Gz4APh&quot;&gt;I didn’t see the full top-level user interface, so I don’t know if that’s changing. But one thing absolutely isn’t: it still runs Windows. It utilizes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/12/12450512/microsoft-windows-10-major-update-redstone-2-features&quot;&gt;shared code in Windows OneCore&lt;/a&gt;, which means you won’t get a traditional Windows desktop shell, but you will be able to run any Universal Windows App on it. It also has the necessary drivers to let you connect a keyboard and a mouse to it over Bluetooth if you really want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;z6RTmE&quot;&gt;Chaitanya Sareen, the principal group program manager for Microsoft Mixed Reality, explains that they’re trying to “make the machine work around the person versus the other way around.” Sareen calls this “instinctual interaction” as opposed to “intuitive,” since it can piggyback off of what we already do with real objects in the world. “Is anyone born saying ‘There’s going to be a close button [in the upper corner of a window]’? No,” he says. “A lot of interfaces we use are learned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;KJRYUs&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is anyone born saying, ‘there’s going to be a close button’? No.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HoecuW&quot;&gt;Sareen is still thinking through some of the details of what the user interface will be, but the goal is to use many of the natural gestures you picked up as a toddler instead of making you learn a whole new interface language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;btp3Ji&quot;&gt;Microsoft is also making new software tools available to developers. One of the most important, Dynamic 365 Guides, will be a mixed reality app with templates to create instructions for repairing real-world things like that ATV. Other tools depend on Microsoft’s cloud services. One is Azure Remote Rendering that lets the HoloLens offload some compute load to the cloud. It exists because the HoloLens 2 can only store and render a limited kind of detail for something like a 3D render of an engine locally. With Remote Rendering, some of the detail can come in real time from the cloud, so it displays potentially infinite levels of detail, allowing you to model and interact with the smallest parts of a holographic machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UTyo5g&quot;&gt;Finally, there’s Azure Spatial Anchors. It lets you pin holograms to real places in the world. At a basic level, it’s not all that different from what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17418614/arkit-update-multiplayer-announced-apple-wwdc-2018&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/cloud-anchors/overview-android&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are already doing in augmented reality: letting multiple devices see and interact with the same virtual object. Microsoft’s ambitions are much grander, though: it wants to create the infrastructure for a “world scale” set of holograms, and it’s building tools that let developers use that infrastructure across platforms, including iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Mvq6rS&quot;&gt;Solving that requires more than just GPS location and object recognition. Kipman talks a lot about distinguishing between identically boring conference rooms that are in the same spot on different floors. Tracking objects in space using optics is famously difficult. Walk in a circle around a building, and your position will drift, so the computer won’t put your ending point at the starting point. It’s a little fuzzy about how far along Microsoft has actually gotten toward solving these problems, but it’s actively working on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;5dyw9Y&quot;&gt;Alex Kipman believes we are on the precipice of the “third era of computing.” First came PCs with their open architectures, second came phones with walled garden app stores, and now he hopes mixed reality headsets will swing the pendulum back to openness because Microsoft intends to keep the HoloLens open. The HoloLens works with Microsoft’s cloud services, but it would work with other ecosystems, too. Kipman says the HoloLens and Azure are “loosely coupled, but tightly aligned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hmj3gI&quot;&gt;I could do more than quibble with his summary of the history of computing and point out that there’s also quite a history of underdogs calling for openness, but the larger point stands: Microsoft thinks that mixed reality is going to be a Big Deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YvmD06&quot;&gt;Understanding what Microsoft’s plans lately has required wading through a lot more jargon than it used to. With the HoloLens 2 specifically, expect a lot of discussion about “time-to-value” (how quickly a user can do something useful after getting a device from an employer) and “intelligent edge” (devices with their own computing power nevertheless connected to the cloud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VmumvP&quot;&gt;There’s a cognitive dissonance for regular consumers with all of that talk. Kipman’s protestations to the contrary, there is plenty of hype around the HoloLens 2. It’s just directed at corporations now. Some of it is well-deserved. I think that the HoloLens 2 is a technical marvel. Just because it isn’t being sold as a consumer device doesn’t mean that it’s not also an important piece of technology, something that could change our conception of what a computer should look like.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Workism Is Making Americans Miserable</title>

<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;n his 1930 essay&lt;/span&gt; “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted a 15-hour workweek in the 21st century, creating the equivalent of a five-day weekend. “For the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem,” Keynes wrote, “how to occupy the leisure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This became a popular view. In a 1957 &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/09/22/96028167.html?action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;amp;pgtype=article&amp;amp;pageNumber=315&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, the writer Erik Barnouw &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/09/22/issue.html?action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that, as work became easier, our identity would be defined by our hobbies, or our family life. “The increasingly automatic nature of many jobs, coupled with the shortening work week [leads] an increasing number of workers to look not to work but to leisure for satisfaction, meaning, expression,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These post-work predictions weren’t entirely wrong. By some counts, Americans work much less than they used to. The average work year has shrunk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2015/7/9/8920297/jeb-bush-work-longer&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;more than 200 hours&lt;/a&gt;. But those figures don’t tell the whole story. Rich, college-educated people—especially men—work more than they did many decades ago. They are reared from their teenage years to make their passion their career and, if they don’t have a calling, told not to yield until they find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economists of the early 20th century did not foresee that work might evolve from a means of material production to a means of identity production. They failed to anticipate that, for the poor and middle class, work would remain a necessity; but for the college-educated elite, it would morph into a kind of religion, promising identity, transcendence, and community. Call it workism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.             &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE GOSPEL OF WORK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline of traditional faith in America has coincided with an explosion of &lt;a href=&quot;http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qgaupm7hKcsOP4xRwj4Yw2UAAAFo448sRgEAAAFKAU5_5ns/https:/www.amazon.com/Seven-Types-Atheism-John-Gray/dp/0374261091/ref=sr_1_1?creativeASIN=0374261091&amp;amp;linkCode=w61&amp;amp;imprToken=QlhicLhXQnkox7pVyasQHg&amp;amp;slotNum=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1544158830&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=seven%20types%20of%20atheism%20john%20gray&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Din%5Bp%5Dcjpe76jo30001usy6u4e4jip4%5Bi%5DTgPFGk%5Bz%5Dm%5Bd%5DD%5Br%5Dgoogle.com&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;new atheisms&lt;/a&gt;. Some people worship &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/irl/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-cult/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;beauty&lt;/a&gt;, some worship &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/andrew-sullivan-americas-new-religions.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;political identities&lt;/a&gt;, and others worship their children. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://bulletin-archive.kenyon.edu/x4280.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;everybody worships something&lt;/a&gt;. And workism is among the most potent of the new religions competing for congregants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is workism? It is the belief that work is not only necessary to economic production, but also the centerpiece of one’s identity and life’s purpose; and the belief that any policy to promote human welfare must &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; encourage more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo industrious&lt;/em&gt; is not new to the American landscape. The American dream—that hoary mythology that hard work always guarantees upward mobility—has for more than a century made the U.S. obsessed with material success and the exhaustive striving required to earn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdppercapita-vs-annual-hours-worked&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;No large country&lt;/a&gt; in the world as productive as the United States averages more hours of work a year. And the gap between the U.S. and other countries is growing. Between 1950 and 2012, annual hours worked per employee fell by about 40 percent in Germany and the Netherlands—but by only 10 percent in the United States. Americans “work longer hours, have shorter vacations, get less in unemployment, disability, and retirement benefits, and retire later, than people in comparably rich societies,” wrote Samuel P. Huntington in his 2005 book &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=6xiYiybkE8kC&amp;amp;pg=PA31&amp;amp;lpg=PA31&amp;amp;dq=tend+to+view+leisure+with+ambivalence+and+at+times+guilt,+disdain+those+who+do+not+work,+and+see+the+work+ethic+as+a+key+element+of+what+it+means+to+be+American.&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=6bywCAoy3d&amp;amp;sig=IfmLAPhgoxALGz1xYsVtVcpeR8A&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiKwsKD_ubfAhUNZd8KHcKsAv4Q6AEwAHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=tend%20to%20view%20leisure%20with%20ambivalence%20and%20at%20times%20guilt%2C%20disdain%20those%20who%20do%20not%20work%2C%20and%20see%20the%20work%20ethic%20as%20a%20key%20element%20of%20what%20it%20means%20to%20be%20American.&amp;amp;f=false&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Are We?: The Challenges to America’s National Identity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group has led the widening of the workist gap: rich men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the highest-earning men actually worked fewer hours per week than middle-class and low-income men, according to a survey by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/SR/SR397bw.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;Minneapolis Fed&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s changed. By 2005, the richest 10 percent of married men had the &lt;em&gt;longest&lt;/em&gt; average workweek. In that same time, college-educated men reduced their leisure time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/the-free-time-paradox-in-america/499826/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;more than any other group&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it is fair to say that elite American men have transformed themselves into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/too-many-elite-american-men-are-obsessed-with-work/479940/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;the world’s premier workaholics&lt;/a&gt;, toiling longer hours than both poorer men in the U.S. and rich men in similarly rich countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift defies economic logic—and economic history. The rich have always worked less than the poor, because they could afford to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/08/aristocratic-18th-century-england-was-one-long-picnic/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;The landed gentry of preindustrial Europe&lt;/a&gt; dined, danced, and gossiped, while serfs toiled without end. In the early 20th century, rich Americans used their ample downtime to buy weekly movie tickets and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/tch_wjec/usa19101929/3culturesocietychanges5.shtml&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;dabble in sports&lt;/a&gt;. Today’s rich American men can afford vastly more downtime. But they have used their wealth to buy the strangest of prizes: more work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps long hours are part of an arms race for status and income among the moneyed elite. Or maybe the logic here isn’t economic at all. It’s emotional—even spiritual. The best-educated and highest-earning Americans, who can have whatever they want, have chosen the office for the same reason that devout Christians attend church on Sundays: It’s where they feel most themselves. “For many of today’s rich there is no such thing as ‘leisure’; in the classic sense—work is their play,” the economist Robert Frank &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2007/03/21/the-workaholic-rich/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. “Building wealth to them is a creative process, and the closest thing they have to fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workism may have started with rich men, but the ethos is spreading—across gender and age. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/does-it-matter-where-you-go-college/577816/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;2018 paper&lt;/a&gt; on elite universities, researchers found that for women, the most important benefit of attending a selective college isn’t higher wages, but more hours at the office. In other words, our elite institutions are minting coed workists. What’s more, in a recent Pew Research report on the epidemic of youth anxiety, 95 percent of teens &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/02/20/most-u-s-teens-see-anxiety-and-depression-as-a-major-problem-among-their-peers/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “having a job or career they enjoy” would be “extremely or very important” to them as an adult. This ranked higher than any other priority, including “helping other people who are in need” (81 percent) or getting married (47 percent). Finding meaning at work beats family and kindness as the top ambition of today’s young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Americans worship workism, its leaders consecrate it from the marble daises of Congress and enshrine it in law. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF2_1_Parental_leave_systems.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;Most&lt;/a&gt; advanced countries give new parents paid leave; but the United States guarantees no such thing. Many advanced countries ease the burden of parenthood with national policies; but U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF3_1_Public_spending_on_childcare_and_early_education.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'None'&quot;&gt;public spending&lt;/a&gt; on child care and early education is near the bottom of international rankings. In most advanced countries, citizens are guaranteed access to health care by their government; but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'None'&quot;&gt;majority of insured Americans&lt;/a&gt; get health care through—where else?—their workplace. Automation and AI may soon threaten the labor force, but America’s welfare system has become more work-based in the past 20 years. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which replaced much of the existing welfare system with programs that made benefits contingent on the recipient’s employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The religion of work isn’t just a cultist feature of America’s elite. It’s also the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;H&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;ere’s a fair&lt;/span&gt; question: Is there anything wrong with hard, even obsessive, work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humankind has not yet invented itself out of labor. Machine intelligence isn’t ready to run the world’s factories, or care for the sick. In every advanced economy, most prime-age people who can work &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;—and in poorer countries, the average workweek is even longer than in the United States. Without work, including nonsalaried labor like raising a child, most people tend to feel miserable. Some evidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'20',r'None'&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that long-term unemployment is even more wrenching than losing a loved one, since the absence of an engaging distraction removes the very thing that tends to provide solace to mourners in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with work, when work must be done. And there is no question that an elite obsession with meaningful work will produce a handful of winners who hit the workist lottery: busy, rich, and deeply fulfilled. But a culture that funnels its dreams of self-actualization into salaried jobs is setting itself up for collective anxiety, mass disappointment, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'21',r'None'&quot;&gt;inevitable burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past century, the American conception of work has shifted from &lt;em&gt;jobs&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;careers&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;callings&lt;/em&gt;—from necessity to status to meaning. In an agrarian or early-manufacturing economy, where tens of millions of people perform similar routinized tasks, there are no delusions about the higher purpose of, say, planting corn or screwing bolts: It’s just a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the professional class and corporate bureaucracies in the early 20th century created the modern journey of a career, a narrative arc bending toward a set of precious initials: VP, SVP, CEO. The upshot is that for today’s workists, anything short of finding one’s vocational soul mate means a wasted life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve created this idea that the meaning of life should be found in work,” says Oren Cass, the author of the book &lt;em&gt;The Once and Future Worker&lt;/em&gt;. “We tell young people that their work should be their passion. ‘Don’t give up until you find a job that you love!’ we say. ‘You should be changing the world!’ we tell them. That is the message in commencement addresses, in pop culture, and frankly, in media, including &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our desks were never meant to be our altars. The modern labor force evolved to serve the needs of consumers and capitalists, not to satisfy tens of millions of people seeking transcendence at the office. It’s hard to self-actualize on the job if you’re a cashier—one of the most common occupations in the U.S.—and even the best white-collar roles have long periods of stasis, boredom, or busywork. This mismatch between expectations and reality is a recipe for severe disappointment, if not outright misery, and it might explain why rates of depression and anxiety in the U.S. are “substantially higher” than they were in the 1980s, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11205-014-0647-1&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'22',r'None'&quot;&gt;a 2014 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of being an observant Christian, Muslim, or Zoroastrian is that these God-fearing worshippers put their faith in an intangible and unfalsifiable force of goodness. But work is tangible, and success is often falsified. To make either the centerpiece of one’s life is to place one’s esteem in the mercurial hands of the market. To be a workist is to worship a god with firing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.             &lt;strong&gt;THE MILLENNIAL WORKIST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Millennial generation—born in the past two decades of the 20th century—came of age in the roaring 1990s, when workism coursed through the veins of American society. On the West Coast, the modern tech sector emerged, minting millionaires who combined utopian dreams with a do-what-you-love ethos. On the East Coast, President Clinton grabbed the neoliberal baton from Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and signed laws that made work the nucleus of welfare policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Anne Helen Petersen wrote in a viral &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'23',r'None'&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; on “Millennial burnout” for &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;—building on ideas Malcolm Harris addressed in his book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Kids-These-Days-Capital-Millennials/dp/0316510866&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'24',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids These Days&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Millennials were honed in these decades into machines of self-optimization. They passed through a childhood of extracurricular overachievement and checked every box of the success sequence, only to have the economy blow up their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s inadvisable to paint 85 million people with the same brush, it’s fair to say that American Millennials have been collectively defined by two external traumas. The first is student debt. Millennials are the most educated generation ever, a distinction that should have made them rich and secure. But rising educational attainment has come at a steep price. Since 2007, outstanding student debt has grown by almost $1 trillion, roughly tripling in just 12 years. And since the economy cratered in 2008, average wages for young graduates have stagnated—making it even harder to pay off loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second external trauma of the Millennial generation has been the disturbance of social media, which has amplified the pressure to craft an image of success—for oneself, for one’s friends and colleagues, and even for one’s parents. But literally &lt;em&gt;visualizing&lt;/em&gt; career success can be difficult in a services and information economy. Blue-collar jobs produce tangible products, like coal, steel rods, and houses. The output of white-collar work—algorithms, consulting projects, programmatic advertising campaigns—is more shapeless and often quite invisible. It’s not glib to say that the whiter the collar, the more invisible the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the physical world leaves few traces of achievement, today’s workers turn to social media to make manifest their accomplishments. Many of them spend hours crafting a separate reality of stress-free smiles, postcard vistas, and Edison-lightbulbed working spaces. “The social media feed [is] evidence of the fruits of hard, rewarding labor and the labor itself,” Petersen writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among Millennial workers, it seems, overwork and “burnout” are outwardly celebrated (even if, one suspects, they’re inwardly mourned). In a recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'25',r'None'&quot;&gt;Why Are Young People Pretending to Love Work?&lt;/a&gt;,” the reporter Erin Griffith pays a visit to the co-working space WeWork, where the pillows urge &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Do what you love&lt;/span&gt;, and the neon signs implore workers to &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;hustle harder&lt;/span&gt;. These dicta resonate with young workers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/14/millennials-work-purpose-linkedin-survey&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'26',r'None'&quot;&gt;As&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlmoore/2014/10/02/millennials-work-for-purpose-not-paycheck/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'27',r'None'&quot;&gt;several studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/10/26/five-things-millennial-workers-want-more-than-a-fat-paycheck/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'28',r'None'&quot;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;, Millennials are meaning junkies at work. “Like all employees,” one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236453/paycheck-purpose-drives-millennials.aspx&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'29',r'None'&quot;&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; survey concluded, “millennials care about their income. But for this generation, a job is about more than a paycheck, it’s about a purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this gospel—&lt;em&gt;Your dream job is out there, so never stop hustling&lt;/em&gt;—is that it’s a blueprint for spiritual and physical exhaustion. Long hours don’t make anybody more productive or creative; they make people &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'30',r'None'&quot;&gt;stressed, tired and bitter&lt;/a&gt;. But the overwork myths survive “because they justify the extreme wealth created for a small group of elite techies,” Griffith &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'31',r'None'&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something slyly dystopian about an economic system that has convinced the most indebted generation in American history to put “purpose over paycheck.” Indeed, if you were designing a &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt; labor force that encouraged overwork without higher wages, what might you do? Perhaps you’d persuade educated young people that income comes second; that no job is just a job; and that the only real reward from work is the ineffable glow of purpose. It is a diabolical game that creates a prize so tantalizing yet rare that almost nobody wins, but everybody feels obligated to play forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.             &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIME FOR HAPPINESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the right time for a confession. I am the very thing that I am criticizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am devoted to my job. I feel most myself when I am fulfilled by my work—including the work of writing an essay about work. My sense of identity is so bound up in my job, my sense of accomplishment, and my feeling of productivity that bouts of writer’s block can send me into an existential funk that can spill over into every part of my life. And I know enough writers, tech workers, marketers, artists, and entrepreneurs to know that my affliction is common, especially within a certain tranche of the white-collar workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some workists, moreover, seem deeply fulfilled. These happy few tend to be intrinsically motivated; they don’t need to share daily evidence of their accomplishments. But maintaining the purity of internal motivations is harder in a world where social media and mass media are so adamant about externalizing all markers of success. There’s &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;’ list of this, and &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;’s list of that; and every Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn profile is conspicuously marked with the metrics of accomplishment—followers, friends, viewers, retweets—that inject all communication with the features of competition. It may be getting harder each year for purely motivated and sincerely happy workers to opt out of the tournament of labor swirling around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workism offers a perilous trade-off. On the one hand, Americans’ high regard for hard work may be responsible for its special place in world history and its reputation as the global capital of start-up success. A culture that worships the pursuit of extreme success will likely produce some of it. But extreme success is a falsifiable god, which rejects the vast majority of its worshippers. Our jobs were never meant to shoulder the burdens of a faith, and they are buckling under the weight. A staggering 87 percent of employees are not engaged at their job, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'32',r'None'&quot;&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;. That number is rising by the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution to this epidemic of disengagement would be to make work less awful. But maybe the better prescription is to make work less &lt;em&gt;central.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can start with public policy. There is new enthusiasm for universal policies—like universal basic income, parental leave, subsidized child care, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/family-fun-pack/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'33',r'None'&quot;&gt;a child allowance&lt;/a&gt;—which would make long working hours less necessary for all Americans. These changes alone might not be enough to reduce Americans’ devotion to work for work’s sake, since it’s the rich who are most devoted. But they would spare the vast majority of the public from the pathological workaholism that grips today’s elites, and perhaps create a bottom-up movement to displace work as the centerpiece of the secular American identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a deeper level, Americans have forgotten an old-fashioned goal of working: It’s about buying free time. The vast majority of workers are happier when they spend more hours with family, friends, and partners, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/19-048_a3814174-e598-46af-ae70-0c81cdffdb9e.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'34',r'None'&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Ashley Whillans, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. In one study, she concluded that the happiest young workers were those who said around the time of their college graduation that they preferred careers that gave them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/19-048_a3814174-e598-46af-ae70-0c81cdffdb9e.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'35',r'None'&quot;&gt;time away from the office&lt;/a&gt; to focus on their relationships and their hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How quaint that sounds. But it’s the same perspective that inspired the economist John Maynard Keynes to predict in 1930 that Americans would eventually have five-day weekends, rather than five-day weeks. It is the belief—the faith, even—that work is not life’s product, but its currency. What we choose to buy with it is the ultimate project of living.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Paul Graham on the Transition to Meat Substitutes</title>
<link>https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1099648817601921024</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1099648817601921024</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;People have little loyalty to meat per se. If you made something that was cheaper and tasted better, most carnivores would switch. Once that shift started, social pressure against eating meat would grow rapidly. It would seem, and in fact would be, perverse.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Discord Scaled Elixir to 5M Concurrent Users (2017)</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;6572&quot; id=&quot;6572&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;From the beginning, Discord has been an early adopter of Elixir. The Erlang VM was the perfect candidate for the highly concurrent, real-time system we were aiming to build. We developed the original prototype of Discord in Elixir; that became the foundation of our infrastructure today. Elixir’s promise was simple: access the power of the Erlang VM through a much more modern and user-friendly language and toolset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4725&quot; id=&quot;4725&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fast forward two years, and we are up to nearly &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;five million concurrent users&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;millions of events per second&lt;/strong&gt; flowing through the system. While we don’t have any regrets with our choice of infrastructure, we did have to do a lot of research and experimentation to get here. Elixir is a new ecosystem, and the Erlang ecosystem lacks information about using it in production (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erlang-in-anger.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.erlang-in-anger.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erlang in Anger&lt;/a&gt; is awesome). What follows is a set of lessons learned and libraries created throughout our journey of making Elixir work for Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5a75&quot; id=&quot;5a75&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Message Fanout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8989&quot; id=&quot;8989&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;While Discord is rich with features, most of it boils down to pub/sub. Users connect to a WebSocket and spin up a session process (a GenServer), which then communicates with remote Erlang nodes that contain guild (internal for a “Discord Server”) processes (also GenServers). When anything is published in a guild, it is fanned out to every session connected to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*R4RGQCxpeFo2gZB41Zbu9w.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1226&quot; data-height=&quot;920&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*R4RGQCxpeFo2gZB41Zbu9w.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*R4RGQCxpeFo2gZB41Zbu9w.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e854&quot; id=&quot;e854&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When a user comes online, they connect to a guild, and the guild publishes a presence to all other connected sessions. Guilds have a lot of other logic behind the scenes, but here’s a simplified example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;4ea3&quot; id=&quot;4ea3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This was a fine approach when we originally built Discord to groups of 25 of less. However, we have been fortunate enough to have “good problems” arise as &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;people started using Discord for large scale groups&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually we ended up with many Discord servers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;/r/Overwatch&lt;/a&gt; with up to 30,000 concurrent users. During peak hours, we began to see these processes fail to keep up with their message queues. At a certain point, we had to manually intervene and turn off features that generated messages to help cope with the load. We had to figure this out before it became a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6b9f&quot; id=&quot;6b9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We began by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alco/benchfella&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/alco/benchfella&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; hot paths within the guild processes and quickly stumbled onto an obvious culprit. Sending messages between Erlang processes was not as cheap as we expected, and the reduction cost — Erlang unit of work used for process scheduling — was also quite high. We found that the wall clock time of a single &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;send/2&lt;/code&gt; call could range from 30μs to 70us due to Erlang de-scheduling the calling process. This meant that during peak hours, publishing an event from a large guild could take anywhere from 900ms to 2.1s! Erlang processes are effectively single threaded, and the only way to parallelize the work is to shard them. That would have been quite an undertaking, and we knew there had to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c8ad&quot; id=&quot;c8ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We knew we had to somehow distribute the work of sending messages. Since spawning processes in Erlang is cheap, our first guess was to just spawn another process to handle each publish. However, each publish could be scheduled at a different time, and Discord clients depend on linearizability of events. That solution also wouldn’t scale well because the guild service was also responsible for an ever-growing amount of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c22&quot; id=&quot;0c22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Inspired by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ostinelli.net/boost-message-passing-between-erlang-nodes/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.ostinelli.net/boost-message-passing-between-erlang-nodes/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about boosting performance of message passing between nodes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hammerandchisel/manifold&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/hammerandchisel/manifold&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Manifold&lt;/a&gt; was born. Manifold distributes the work of sending messages to the remote nodes of the PIDs (Erlang process identifier), which guarantees that the sending processes at most only calls &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;send/2&lt;/code&gt; equal to the number of involved remote nodes. Manifold does this by first grouping PIDs by their remote node and then sending to &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;Manifold.Partitioner&lt;/code&gt; on each of those nodes. The partitioner then consistently hashes the PIDs using &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;:erlang.phash2/2&lt;/code&gt;, groups them by number of cores, and sends them to child workers. Finally, those workers send the messages to the actual processes. This ensures the partitioner does not get overloaded and still provides the linearizability guaranteed by &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;send/2&lt;/code&gt;. This solution was effectively a drop-in replacement for &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;send/2&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;adfa&quot; id=&quot;adfa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;An awesome side-effect of Manifold was that we were able to not only distribute the CPU cost of fanning out messages, but also reduce the network traffic between nodes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Network Reduction on 1 Guild Node&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;edd4&quot; id=&quot;edd4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Manifold is available on our GitHub, so give it a spin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discordapp/manifold&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/discordapp/manifold&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/discordapp/manifold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4e58&quot; id=&quot;4e58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fast Access Shared Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;968f&quot; id=&quot;968f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Discord is a distributed system achieved through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consistent hashing&lt;/a&gt;. Using this method requires us to create a ring data structure that can be used to lookup the node of a particular entity. We want that to be fast, so we chose the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismoos/hash-ring&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismoos/hash-ring&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;library by Chris Moos&lt;/a&gt; via a Erlang C port (process responsible for interfacing with C code). It worked great for us, but as Discord scaled, we started to notice issues when we had bursts of users reconnecting. The Erlang process responsible for controlling the ring would start to get so busy that it would fail to keep up with requests to the ring, and the whole system would become overloaded. The solution at first seemed obvious: run multiple processes with the ring data to better utilize all the machine’s cores to answer the requests. However, we noticed that this was a hot path. Could we do better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*UcM21Vu8CeoYLKuYIn-d5A.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1226&quot; data-height=&quot;930&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*UcM21Vu8CeoYLKuYIn-d5A.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*UcM21Vu8CeoYLKuYIn-d5A.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cbc8&quot; id=&quot;cbc8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s break down the cost of this hot path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;2c9c&quot; id=&quot;2c9c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A user can be in any number of guilds, but an average user is in 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3303&quot; id=&quot;3303&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;An Erlang VM responsible for sessions can have up to 500,000 live sessions on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;30a6&quot; id=&quot;30a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;When a session connects, it has to lookup the remote node for each guild it is interested in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;c8ec&quot; id=&quot;c8ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The cost of communicating with another Erlang process using request/reply is about 12μs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;c9e2&quot; id=&quot;c9e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If the session server were to crash and restart, it would take about 30 seconds just for the cost of lookups on the ring. That does not even account for Erlang de-scheduling the single process involved in the ring for other processes’ work. Could we remove this cost completely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6d9d&quot; id=&quot;6d9d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The first thing people do in Elixir when they want to speed up data access is to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;http://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ETS&lt;/a&gt;. ETS is a fast, mutable dictionary implemented in C; the tradeoff is that data is copied in and out of it. We couldn’t just move our ring into ETS because we were using a C port to control the ring, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hammerandchisel/ex_hash_ring&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/hammerandchisel/ex_hash_ring&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we converted the code to pure Elixir&lt;/a&gt;. Once that was implemented, we had a process whose job was to own the ring and constantly copy it into ETS so other processes could read directly from ETS. This noticeably improved performance, but ETS reads were about 7μs, and we were still spending 17.5 seconds on looking up values in the ring. The ring data structure is actually fairly large, and copying it in and out of ETS was the majority of the cost. We were disappointed; in any other language we could easily just have a shared value that was safe to read. There had to be a way to do this in Erlang!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef87&quot; id=&quot;ef87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After doing some research, we found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb/blob/master/src/mochiglobal.erl&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb/blob/master/src/mochiglobal.erl&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mochiglobal&lt;/a&gt;, a module that exploits a feature of the VM: if Erlang sees a function that always returns the same constant data, it puts that data into a read-only shared heap that processes can access without copying the data. mochiglobal takes advantage of this by creating an Erlang module with one function at runtime and compiling it. Since the data is never copied, the lookup cost decreases to 0.3us, bringing the total time down to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;750ms&lt;/strong&gt;! There’s no such thing as a free lunch though; the cost of building a module with a data structure as large as the ring at runtime can take up to a second. The good news is that we rarely change the ring, so it was a penalty we were willing to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d55&quot; id=&quot;5d55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We decided to port mochiglobal to Elixir and add some functionality to avoid creating atoms. Our version is called FastGlobal and is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/discordapp/fastglobal&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/discordapp/fastglobal&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/discordapp/fastglobal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;aaf1&quot; id=&quot;aaf1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Limited Concurrency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14fc&quot; id=&quot;14fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;After solving the performance of the node lookup hot path, we noticed that the processes responsible for handling &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;guild_pid&lt;/code&gt; lookup on the guild nodes were getting backed up. The inherent back pressure of the slow node lookup had previously protected these processes. The new problem was that nearly 5,000,000 session processes were trying to stampede ten of these processes (one on each guild node). Making this path faster wouldn’t solve the problem; the underlying issue was that the call of a session process to this guild registry would timeout and leave the request in the queue of the guild registry. It would then retry the request after a backoff, but perpetually pile up requests and get into an unrecoverable state. Sessions would block on these requests until they timed out while receiving messages from other services, causing them to balloon their message queues and eventually OOM the whole Erlang VM resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://status.discordapp.com/incidents/dj3l6lw926kl&quot; data-href=&quot;https://status.discordapp.com/incidents/dj3l6lw926kl&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cascading service outages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;52c3&quot; id=&quot;52c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We needed to make session processes smarter; ideally, they wouldn’t even try to make these calls to the guild registry if a failure was inevitable. We didn’t want to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;circuit breaker&lt;/a&gt; because we didn’t want a burst in timeouts to result in a temporary state where no attempts are made at all. We knew how we would solve this in other languages, but how would we solve it in Elixir?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a4f6&quot; id=&quot;a4f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In most other languages, we could use an atomic counter to track outstanding requests and bail early if the number was too high, effectively implementing a semaphore. The Erlang VM is built around coordinating through communication between processes, but we knew we didn’t want to overload a process responsible for doing this coordination. After some research we stumbled upon &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;:ets.update_counter/4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; which performs atomic conditional increment operations on a number inside an ETS key. Since we needed high concurrency, we could also run ETS in &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;write_concurrency&lt;/code&gt; mode but still read the value out, since &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;:ets.update_counter/4&lt;/code&gt; returns the result. This gave us the fundamental piece to create our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hammerandchisel/semaphore&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/hammerandchisel/semaphore&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Semaphore&lt;/a&gt; library. It is extremely easy to use and performs really well at high throughput:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;decb&quot; id=&quot;decb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This library has proved instrumental in protecting our Elixir infrastructure. A similar situation to the aforementioned cascading outages occurred as recently as last week, but there were no outages this time. Our presence services crashed due to an unrelated issue, but the session services did not even budge, and the presence services were able to rebuild within minutes after restarting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;d27e&quot; id=&quot;d27e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6717&quot; id=&quot;6717&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Choosing to use and getting familiar with Erlang and Elixir has proven to be a great experience. If we had to go back and start over, we would definitely choose the same path. We hope that sharing our experiences and tools proves useful to other Elixir and Erlang developers, and we hope to continue sharing as we progress on our journey, solving problems and learning lessons along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tracking my phone&amp;#039;s silent connections</title>
<link>https://kushaldas.in/posts/tracking-my-phone-s-silent-connections.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kushaldas.in/posts/tracking-my-phone-s-silent-connections.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My phone has more friends than me. It talks to more peers (computers) than the number of human beings I talk on an average. In this age of smartphones and mobile apps for A-Z things, we are dependent on these technologies. However, at the same time, we don’t know much of what is going on in the computers equipped with powerful cameras, GPS device, microphone we are carrying all the time. All these apps are talking to their respective servers (or can we call them masters?), but, there is no easy way to track them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions bothered me for a long time: I wanted to see the servers my phone is connecting to, and I want to block those connections as I wish. However, I never managed to work on this. A few weeks ago, I finally sat down to start working to build up a system by reusing already available open source projects and tools to create the system, which will allow me to track what my phone is doing. Maybe not in full details, but, at least shed some light on the network traffic from the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initial trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to create a wifi hotspot at home using a Raspberry Pi and then started capturing all the packets from the device using standard tools (&lt;code&gt;dumpcap&lt;/code&gt;) and later reading through the logs using Wireshark. This procedure meant that I could only capture when I am connected to the network at home. What about when I am not at home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next round&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I took a bit different approach. I chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/trailofbits/algo&quot;&gt;algo&lt;/a&gt; to create a VPN server. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/&quot;&gt;WireGuard&lt;/a&gt;, it became straightforward to connect my iPhone to the VPN. This process also allows capturing all the traffic from the phone very easily on the VPN server. A few days in the experiment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kashhill&quot;&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; started posting her experiment named &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/life-without-the-tech-giants-1830258056&quot;&gt;Life Without the Tech Giants&lt;/a&gt;, where she started blocking all the services from 5 big technology companies. With her help, I contacted &lt;a href=&quot;https://dhruvmehrotra.info&quot;&gt;Dhruv Mehrotra&lt;/a&gt;, who is a technologist behind the story. After talking to him, I felt that I am going in the right direction. He already posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/want-to-really-block-the-tech-giants-heres-how-1832261612&quot;&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; on how they did the blocking, and you can try that at home :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking at the data after 1 week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After capturing the data for the first week, I moved the captured pcap files into my computer. Wrote some Python code to put the data into a SQLite database, enabling me to query the data much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Domain Name System (DNS) data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System&quot;&gt;Domain Name System&lt;/a&gt; (DNS) is a decentralized system which helps to translate the human memory safe domain names (like kushaldas.in) into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like 192.168.1.1 ). Computers talk to each other using these IP addresses, we, don’t have to worry to remember so many names. When the developers develop their applications for the phone, they generally use those domain names to specify where the app should connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I plot all the different domains (including any subdomain) which got queried at least 10 times in a week, we see the following graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kushaldas.in/images/dns_queries.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice is how the phone is trying to find servers from Apple, which makes sense as this is an iPhone. I use the mobile Twitter app a lot, so we also see many queries related to Twitter. Lookout is a special mention there, it was suggested to me by my friends who understand these technologies and security better than me. The 3rd position is taken by Google, though sometimes I watch Youtube videos, but, the phone queried for many other Google domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many queries to Akamai CDN service, and I could not find any easy way to identify those hosts, the same with Amazon AWS related hosts. If you know any better way, please drop me a note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a lot of data analytics related companies were also queried. &lt;code&gt;dev.appboy.com&lt;/code&gt; is a major one, and thankfully algo already blocked that domain in the DNS level. I don’t know which app is trying to connect to which all servers, I found about a few of the apps in my phone by searching about the client list of the above-mentioned analytics companies. Next, in coming months, I will start blocking those hosts/domains one by one and see which all apps stop working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking at data flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of DNS queries is an easy start, but, next I wanted to learn more about the actual servers my phone is talking to. The paranoid part inside of me was pushing for discovering these servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we put all of the major companies the phone is talking to, we get the following graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kushaldas.in/images/all_companies.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is leading the chart by taking 44% of all the connections, and the number is 495225 times. Twitter is in the second place, and Edgecastcdn is in the third. My phone talked to Google servers 67344 number of times, which is like 7 times less than the number of times Apple itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kushaldas.in/images/selected_companies.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next graph, I removed the big players (including Google and Amazon). Then, I can see that analytics companies like &lt;code&gt;nflxso.net&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mparticle.com&lt;/code&gt; have 31% of the connections, which is a lot. Most probably I will start with blocking these two first. The 3 other CDN companies, Akamai, Cloudfront, and Cloudflare has 8%, 7%, and 6% respectively. Do I know what all things are these companies tracking? Nope, and that is scary enough that one of my friend commented “It makes me think about throwing my phone in the garbage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about encrypted vs unencrypted traffic? What all protocols are being used? I tried to find the answer for the first question, and the answer looks like the following graph. Maybe the number will come down if I try to refine the query and add other parameters, that is a future task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kushaldas.in/images/http_https.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, I am working on creating a set of tools, which then can be deployed on the VPN server, that will provide a user-friendly way to monitor, and block/unblock traffic from their phone. The major part of the work is to make sure that the whole thing is easy to deploy, and can be used by someone with less technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How can you help?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing we need is the knowledge of “How to analyze the data we are capturing?”. It is one thing to make reports for personal user, but, trying to help others is an entirely different game altogether. We will, of course, need all sorts of contributions to the project. Before anything else, we will have to join the random code we have, into a proper project structure. Keep following this blog for more updates and details about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note to self&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not try to read data after midnight, or else I will again think a local address as some random dynamic address in Bangkok and freak out (thank you reverse-dns).&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;I'm Steven Pruitt - Wikipedia user name Ser Amantio di Nicolao - and I was featured on CBS Saturday Morning a few weeks ago due to the fact that I'm the top editor, by edit count, on the English Wikipedia. Here's my user page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s90z9tc-27 kwjyWe&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ser_Amantio_di_Nicolao&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ser_Amantio_di_Nicolao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;Several people have asked me to do an AMA since the piece aired, and I'm happy to acquiesce...but today's really the first time I've had a free block of time to do one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;I'll be here for the next couple of hours, and promise to try and answer as many questions as I can. I know y'all require proof: I hope this does it, otherwise I will have taken this totally useless selfie for nothing:&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;s90z9tc-27 kwjyWe&quot; href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/zJFpqN7&quot;&gt;https://imgur.com/a/zJFpqN7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;Fire away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;Edit: OK, I'm going to start winding things down. I have to step away for a little while, and I'll try to answer some more questions before I go to bed, but otherwise that's that for now. Sorry if I haven't been able to get to your question. (I hesitate to add: you &lt;em class=&quot;s90z9tc-15 kRPwUl&quot;&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; always e-mail me through my user page. I don't bite unless provoked severely.)&lt;/p&gt;
