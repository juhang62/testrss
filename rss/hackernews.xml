<description>&lt;p class=&quot;Text_Body&quot;&gt;Kris Folland grows corn, wheat and soybeans and raises cattle on 2,000 acres near Halma in the northwest corner of Minnesota, so his operation is far from small. But when he last bought a new tractor, he opted for an old one — a 1979 John Deere 4440.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Text_Body&quot;&gt;He retrofitted it with automatic steering guided by satellite, and he and his kids can use the tractor to feed cows, plant fields and run a grain auger. The best thing? The tractor cost $18,000, compared to upward of $150,000 for a new tractor. And Folland doesn’t need a computer to repair it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Text_Body&quot;&gt;“This is still a really good tractor,” said Folland, who owns two other tractors built before 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;#7: But Zed, you say to me, how can a school decrease the number of graduates?

Require 12 hour study days, terrible teachers, shoddy or no curriculum, abusive teachers, vague final projects, or extend the real curriculum past the 3 months.

That'll flush out the &quot;weak&quot; for sure&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The McDonnell Douglas-Boeing merger led to the 737 Max crisis</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1776080/how-the-mcdonnell-douglas-boeing-merger-led-to-the-737-max-crisis/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Late in the summer of 1997, two of the most critical players in global aviation became a single tremendous titan. Boeing, one of the US’s largest and &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1570338/boeings-share-price-has-an-outsized-impact-on-the-dow-jones/&quot;&gt;most important companies&lt;/a&gt;, acquired its longtime plane manufacturer rival, McDonnell Douglas, in what was then the country’s tenth-largest merger. The resulting giant took Boeing’s name. More unexpectedly, it took its culture and strategy from McDonnell Douglas—even its commercial aviation department was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/opinion/mcdonnell-douglas-s-troubles.html?searchResultPosition=1&quot;&gt;struggling to retain customers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Reporting on the deal, the New York Times made an observation that now seems prescient: “The full effect of the proposed merger on employees, communities, competitors, customers and investors will not be known for months, maybe even years.” Nearly 20 years later, one such effect has become the aviation story of the year, or perhaps the decade—the crashes of two 737 Max jets and the loss of 346 lives, not to mention the still-rising associated costs of &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1734220/the-737-max-has-cost-boeing-9-2-billion-and-counting/&quot;&gt;around $10 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;In a clash of corporate cultures, where Boeing’s engineers and McDonnell Douglas’s bean-counters went head-to-head, the smaller company won out. The result was a move away from expensive, ground-breaking engineering and toward what some called a more cut-throat culture, devoted to keeping costs down and favoring upgrading older models at the expense of wholesale innovation. Only now, with the 737 indefinitely grounded, are we beginning to see the scale of its effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;“The fatal fault line was the McDonnell Douglas takeover,” says Clive Irving, author of &lt;em&gt;Jumbo: The Making of the Boeing 747&lt;/em&gt;. “Although Boeing was supposed to take over McDonnell Douglas, it ended up the other way around.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A turbulent path to an uneasy union&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Since the start of the jet age, Boeing had been less a business and more, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/10/02/288426/index.htm&quot;&gt;writer Jerry Useem put it&lt;/a&gt; in Fortune in 2000, “an association of engineers devoted to building amazing flying machines.” For a time, this served it well: An engineers’ company made planes to make its engineers proud, whatever the cost. Employees enjoyed watertight contracts, thanks to an assertive, family-like union, and an attitude to aviation that put design and quality above all else. In the process, it produced some of the world’s greatest planes. The 707, for instance, was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/technology/Boeing-707&quot;&gt;first commercially successful jet&lt;/a&gt;; the 727, launched in 1963, allowed airlines to reach airports in the developing world or with shorter runways. The company’s philosophy, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=f0FQhBbBd-wC&amp;amp;pg=PT49&amp;amp;lpg=PT49&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cgo-for-it-and-damn-the+expenses%E2%80%94but+not+damn+the+quality.%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=bRreE_f2cX&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U3fRZ9yfQa5v8Rv1MYlqBRJhs3_bw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjl97SDjNbmAhXwmeAKHRtPBY0Q6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%E2%80%9Cgo-for-it-and-damn-the%20expenses%E2%80%94but%20not%20damn%20the%20quality.%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;one close observer described it&lt;/a&gt; to researcher Edward Greenberg, was “go-for-it-and-damn-the expenses—but not damn the quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the company, and the US aviation industry more generally, found itself in an especially sweet spot, Greenberg told Quartz. It was “the golden age,” he said, “because the airlines—since the government actually controlled where planes could go, (assigning) landing rights in a variety of places—didn’t have competition on those routes. Any costs that the engineers at Boeing wanted to add to the plane—because it was real cool engineering, or made the plane faster or safer—didn’t matter to the airlines and they could just pass on the costs of all of that in ticket prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;As engineers first, managers second, Boeing’s bosses answered to airlines: The plane that would become the 737, for example, was first ordered in 1964, after Lufthansa boss Gerhard Holtje found a need for a craft that could carry around 100 passengers on short, intercity European routes. By the plane’s third incarnation, in 1981, Boeing was onto a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonnell Douglas was in an out-and-out nosedive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;With the dawn of the 1980s, however, Boeing’s traditional way of doing things seemed increasingly out of touch. Deregulation under US presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan had changed the economics of the industry, Greenberg said. “The idea was that if you had more competition, it would drop prices for consumers. Suddenly, airlines are looking at this and saying, ‘Oh my God, we can’t pass on the cost by continuously raising ticket prices.’ That put pressure back on Boeing, and on Airbus eventually, to become cost-conscious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As costs climbed, the company’s stock price slumped. Everything seemed to point towards one solution: a leaner operation with more digitalization and a new openness to outsourcing and partnering. At the same time, management was desperately searching for more diverse ways to remain financially aloft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;If, figuratively speaking, Boeing was suffering from engine trouble, McDonnell Douglas was in an out-and-out nosedive. The Missouri-based aerospace company was formed in 1967 after the merger of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company. By the 1990s, while its military wing remained robust, its commercial operations were waning. In 1996, Boeing took approximately 60% of the industry’s new commercial aircraft orders. Airbus, the European consortium, lingered far behind it, at 35%. McDonnell Douglas took the remaining 5%. Even its military operations had seen brighter days: The year before the merger, the Pentagon rejected its bid for new fighter jets, turning to Boeing and the Lockheed Martin Corporation instead. Boeing might have been struggling, but McDonnell Douglas seemed destined for failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;In 1996, Boeing acquired Rockwell, a smaller aerospace and defense manufacturer, for around $3 billion. Now, it had its sights on McDonnell Douglas. These decisions, made by Boeing CEO Phil Condit, were made with a close eye on the company’s bottom line ahead of a hotly anticipated commercial-jet boom. An ambitious program of cost-cutting, outsourcing, and digitalization had already begun. For Boeing, acquiring McDonnell Douglas held many attractions. On the one hand, it would be a victory lap of sorts, to finally take over the remnants of its oldest rival. On another, it was a prime opportunity to pick up McDonnell Douglas’ valuable military expertise and diversify its own offerings away from the turbulent commercial aircraft market, with its cycle of booms and busts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;And then there was Airbus. In less than a decade, the European company had more than doubled its annual deliveries—an upwards trajectory Boeing executives feared meant the loss of its position as the foremost commercial plane manufacturer in an increasingly expensive world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atlas-embed atlas-chart&quot; data-id=&quot;Bws8CtU_c&quot; data-width=&quot;640&quot; data-height=&quot;400&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Embedded chart from TheAtlas.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theatlas.com/i/atlas_Bws8CtU_c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chart from TheAtlas.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;After the intended merger was announced, antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic considered their options. Airbus and Boeing were already one another’s only significant competitor. McDonnell Douglas’ very existence served a certain purpose—it appears to have made the market more competitive, in helping to drive down prices—but it remained in the doldrums. Regulators noted McDonnell Douglas “no longer [constituted] a meaningful competitive force in the commercial aircraft market,” and that, without a full line of large and small jets, it had no real plan to stave off the “grim prospect” of collapse. Without a takeover, there is every indication that the company might have failed all by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The honeymoon period?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Eventually, after months of deliberation, regulators approved the match in August of 1997,  with four out of five Federal Trade Commission members ruling that it would not “substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in either defense or commercial aircraft markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Boeing bought the McDonnell Douglas for $14 billion. Shares of both enjoyed a slight bump. Boeing’s new acquisition allowed Condit to move forward on his other key project: diversifying Boeing’s revenue streams. With the lucrative government contracts it picked up with McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell, Boeing’s comparatively fledgling space and defense operations could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;In the eyes of many Boeing employees, McDonnell Douglas executives seemed to do disproportionately well out of the merger: Many were given senior positions following the acquisition, with the company’s head, Harry Stonecipher initially appointed chief operating officer and holding &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=p3DfBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA119&amp;amp;lpg=PA119&amp;amp;dq=harry+stonecipher+phil+condit+compensation+package&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=gW3A0NyNpb&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U0N4nPdb35rW7_tyOeyqFIF94B20w&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNgo76xb_mAhWvq1kKHS4nCWwQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;more than twice the number of shares&lt;/a&gt; in the company as Condit, who remained CEO. Stonecipher and John McDonnell, formerly the chair of McDonnell Douglas’ board, were now the two largest individual shareholders of the merged companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stonecipher eventually became Boeing CEO in 2003, but was pushed out in 2005, after an internal investigation revealed that he was having a consensual, but extramarital relationship with a fellow Boeing executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=f0FQhBbBd-wC&amp;amp;pg=PT69&amp;amp;lpg=PT69&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWe+thought+that+we%E2%80%99d+kill+McDonnell+Douglas+and+we+had+it+on+the+ropes,%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=bRrdG19ZgQ&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U01V_JATTd_Kj5nCtDud2WlSpQ_fQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_xZO7v7_mAhWKnOAKHVNlDkgQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;a 2007 interview&lt;/a&gt;, Ron Woodard, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981213&amp;amp;slug=2788788&quot;&gt;former president of Boeing’s Commercial Airplane&lt;/a&gt; Group, bemoaned the changes the merger brought with it. “We thought that we’d kill McDonnell Douglas and we had it on the ropes,” he said. “I still believe that Harry outsmarted Phil and his gang bought Boeing with Boeing’s money. We were all just disgusted.” More than that, he added, the company had “paid way, way too much money [for McDonnell Douglas] and we’re still paying for it. We wrote off so many tens of billions of dollars for that whole mess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t perform, you don’t stay on the team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Inside the company, there were rumblings of dissatisfaction. A formerly cosy atmosphere, in which engineers ran the show and executives aged out of the company gracefully, was suddenly cut-throat. In 1998, the year after the merger, Stonecipher warned employees they needed to “quit behaving like a family and become more like a team. If you don’t perform, you don’t stay on the team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Everything seemed to be changing—the leadership, the culture, even the headquarters, with a move from Seattle to Chicago in 2001. The new location seems to have been especially disorienting for Boeing employees. “There was something about the locus of the company which was unique, that its whole history had almost been written on the same runway from the beginning, at Boeing Field” in Seattle, says Irving. Even the company’s ethos seemed to have changed, he says: “There was a kind of inherent ethic about how you went about designing and manufacturing and flying planes that carried passengers, as opposed to flying military planes.” For the former, you were serving individuals and airlines, interested primarily in the best way to fly; for the latter, you were playing a small part in the US’ global military operations. Meanwhile, increasing shareholder value, once scarcely a consideration, grew to be more and more of a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Many employees struggled to adjust, or resented what they saw as a changing of the guard, where investors took priority over passengers. “Many of the engineers happened to be the guys who pioneered the 707, and so took the company into the jet age and there was a kind of esprit de corps among them and an integrity of purpose among them,” says Irving. “And they had a collective sense of what the company was meant to do and what its responsibilities were.” Now, a passion for great planes was replaced with “a passion for affordability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Stonecipher seems to have agreed with this assessment. “When people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent, so it’s run like a business rather than a great engineering firm,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-02-29-0402290256-story.html&quot;&gt;told the Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. “It is a great engineering firm, but people invest in a company because they want to make money.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a change in approach led to the 737 Max&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Two decades on, perhaps the most lasting consequence of the change in culture has been in Boeing’s approach to aircraft building. Cutting costs and diversifying revenue ought to have served as an ideal way to subsidize the expensive process of plane development. Instead, with engineers now disempowered and management far away in Chicago, the actual building of new planes in Seattle all but stalled. Boeing would not actually announce even the plans for a new plane until 2003, with the 787 Dreamliner. Throughout this time, Boeing was led by its first chairman without a traditional aviation background: James McNerney had instead spent almost two decades in management at General Electric—now, he was following a tried-and-tested route of cutting, downsizing, and shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;That approach was applied to upgrading the 737, which had become the victim of its own success. In its five-decade history, airlines have cumulatively ordered more than 10,000 of the planes—an aviation rock star. But rather than retiring the plane, and replacing it with the next big thing, Boeing instead opted to keep costs down by tinkering and adjusting the model to fit still more passengers. The version it called the Max, writes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-boeing-bean-counters-courted-the-737-max-disaster&quot;&gt;Irving in the Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;, was the alternative, cheaper solution. “The airlines went for it because the new engines promised higher efficiency and—so it seemed—pilots would find it very simple to move from the [1997 737 Next Gen] to the Max.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of the above should have passed the ‘OK’ pencil.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Pilots have long been aware of the plane’s shortcomings. Writing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/how-the-boeing-737-max-disaster-looks-to-a-software-developer&quot;&gt;engineering industry publication IEEE Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;, pilot and software developer Gregory Travis explains how these repeat redesigns have led to recent tragedies. The plane was designed for a time before machine-aided cargo loading and so sits low to the ground to aid ground crews hauling baggage. But as the planes grew larger, so too have their engines. Instead of being hung under the wing, as in earlier models, the engines have been moved forward and upward, potentially leading to an aerodynamic stall under certain circumstances. “Instead of going back to the drawing board and getting the airframe hardware right, Boeing relied on something called the ‘Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System,’ or MCAS,” he writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;Put very crudely, this was a software fix for a hardware problem—and one that was far from perfect. In Travis’ estimation, the software relied on the wrong systems and sensors, without cross-checking them against other easily accessible information from the plane’s sensors. “None of the above should have passed muster,” he writes. “None of the above should have passed the ‘OK’ pencil of the most junior engineering staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light through the clouds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;For Boeing, here’s the good news: Airlines are mostly quite profitable—and profitable airlines buy airplanes. The global population able to afford to fly is growing at a staggering pace, which should also mean yet more airline purchases. Boeing may not be the absolute world number one any more, but it enjoys a duopoly with Airbus and is still a preferred supplier for a huge number of airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;But there’s no denying that the Max has damaged the company. Boeing has now halted production of the plane altogether; earlier this month, CEO Dennis Muilenberg was very publicly fired by the board. Some 400 planes orders are presently on hold, while 387 already-delivered MAX planes have been grounded for months. Early assurances that recertification by the FAA would be easy to come by are now looking decidedly hollow. In the months since the crashes, longtime Boeing customers, such as United Airlines, have turned to Airbus instead—particularly amid fears passengers will refuse to fly the 737 when it returns to service. Having slumped by about 25% after the initial crashes, Boeing’s share price has since scarcely moved. Meanwhile, progress on new planes, including the proposed 797, has slowed as it continue its efforts to work with the FAA on the Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;There are no easy fixes for Boeing. A company that set the standard for jet-age manufacturing is now facing a crisis that goes to the heart of its identity: its ability to build airplanes. Scrapping the 737 altogether would mean the loss of untold billions—not scrapping it may yet cost even more. But if, as seems apparent, the company’s cost-cutters led it down the path towards this mess, its engineers may be the ones forced to bring it back out into the light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; This story has been updated to reflect that airline deregulation began under US president Jimmy Carter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;More details are emerging about the scale and scope of disgraced data company &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/cambridge-analytica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;cambridge-analytica&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica’s&lt;/a&gt; activities in elections around the world — via a cache of internal documents that’s being released by former employee and self-styled whistleblower, Brittany Kaiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The now &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/cambridge-analytica-shuts-down/&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; data modelling company, which infamously used stolen Facebook data to target voters for President Donald Trump’s campaign in the 2016 U.S. election, was at the center of the data misuse scandal that, in 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/facebooks-scandals-in-2018-effect-on-stock.html&quot;&gt;wiped billions off Facebook’s share price&lt;/a&gt; and contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/&quot;&gt;$5BN FTC fine for the tech giant last summer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However plenty of questions remain, including where, for whom and exactly how Cambridge Analytica and its parent entity SCL Elections operated; as well as how much &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook’s&lt;/a&gt; leadership knew about the dealings of the firm that was using its platform to extract data and target political ads — helped by &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1233579/facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-worked-side-by-side-at-a-trump-campaign-office-in-san-antonio/&quot;&gt;some of Facebook’s own staff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain Facebook employees were referring to Cambridge Analytica as a “sketchy” company as far back as &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/&quot;&gt;September 2015&lt;/a&gt; — yet the tech giant only pulled the plug on platform access after the scandal went global in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica-the-data-analysis-firm-that-worked-for-the-trump-campaign/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook CEO &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;mark-zuckerberg&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; has also continued to maintain that he only personally learned about CA from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data&quot;&gt;December 2015 &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article, which broke the story that Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign was using psychological data based on research covering tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without permission. (It wasn’t until March 2018 that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump&quot;&gt;further investigative journalism&lt;/a&gt; blew the lid off the story — turning it into a global scandal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Cambridge Analytica business development director Kaiser, who had a central role in last year’s Netflix documentary about the data misuse scandal (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/27/the-great-hack-tells-us-that-data-corrupts/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Hack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), began her latest data dump late last week — publishing links to scores of previously unreleased internal documents via a Twitter account called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HindsightFiles&quot;&gt;@HindsightFiles&lt;/a&gt;. (At the time of writing Twitter has placed a temporary limit on viewing the account — citing “unusual activity”, presumably as a result of the volume of downloads it’s attracting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since becoming part of the public CA story Kaiser has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/facebook-your-data-is-your-property-your-permission-your-digital-assets-ownyourdata&quot;&gt;campaigning&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook to grant users property rights over their data. She claims she’s releasing new documents from her former employer now because she’s concerned this year’s US election remains at risk of the same type of big-data-enabled voter manipulation that tainted the 2016 result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m very fearful about what is going to happen in the US election later this year, and I think one of the few ways of protecting ourselves is to get as much information out there as possible,” she told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/04/cambridge-analytica-data-leak-global-election-manipulation&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Democracies around the world are being auctioned to the highest bidder,” is the tagline clam on the Twitter account Kaiser is using to distribute the previously unpublished documents — more than 100,000 of which are set to be released over the coming months, per the newspaper’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The releases are being grouped into countries — with documents to-date covering Brazil, Kenya and Malaysia. There is also a themed release dealing with issues pertaining to Iran, and another covering CA/SCL’s work for Republican John Bolton’s Political Action Committee in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The releases look set to underscore the global scale of CA/SCL’s social media-fuelled operations, with Kaiser &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HindsightFiles/status/1212848706619351060/photo/1&quot;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; that the previously unreleased emails, project plans, case studies and negotiations span at least 65 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spreadsheet of associate officers included in the current cache lists SCL associates in a large number of countries and regions including Australia, Argentina, the Balkans, India, Jordan, Lithuania, the Philippines, Switzerland and Turkey, among others. A second tab listing “potential” associates covers political and commercial contacts in various other places including Ukraine and even China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UK parliamentary committee which investigated online political campaigning and voter manipulation in 2018 — taking evidence from Kaiser and CA whistleblower &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/chris-wylie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;chris-wylie&quot;&gt;Chris Wylie,&lt;/a&gt; among others — urged the government to audit the PR and strategic communications industry, warning in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/179110.htm&quot;&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Recommendation&quot;&gt;how “easy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;Recommendation&quot;&gt;it is for discredited companies to reinvent themselves and potentially &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Recommendation&quot;&gt;use the same data and the same tactics to undermine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Recommendation&quot;&gt;governments, including in the UK”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Data analytics firms have played a key role in elections around the world. Strategic communications companies frequently run campaigns internationally, which are financed by less than transparent means and employ legally dubious methods,” the DCMS committee also concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee’s final report highlighted election and referendum campaigns SCL Elections (and its myriad “associated companies”) had been involved in in around thirty countries. But per Kaiser’s telling its activities — and/or ambitions — appear to have been considerably broader and even global in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents released to date include a case study of work that &lt;span&gt;CA was contracted to carry out in the U.S. for Bolton’s Super PAC — where it undertook what is described as “a personality-targeted digital advertising campaign with three interlocking goals: to persuade voters to elect Republican Senate candidates in Arkansas, North Carolina and New Hampshire; to elevate national security as an issue of importance and to increase public awareness of Ambassador Bolton’s Super PAC”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here CA writes that it &lt;span&gt;segmented “persuadable and low-turnout voter populations to identify several key groups that could be influenced by Bolton Super PAC messaging”, targeting them with online and Direct TV ads — designed to “appeal directly to specific groups’ personality traits, priority issues and demographics”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot; readability=&quot;74.791717417783&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychographic profiling — &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/heres-cambridge-analyticas-plan-for-voters-facebook-data/&quot;&gt;derived from CA’s modelling of Facebook user data&lt;/a&gt; — was used to segment U.S. voters into targetable groups, including for serving microtargeted online ads. The company badged voters with personality-specific labels such as “highly neurotic” — targeting individuals with customized content designed to pray on their fears and/or hopes based on its analysis of voters’ personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of segmenting voters by personality and sentiment was made commercially possible by access to identity-linked personal data — which puts Facebook’s population-scale collation of identities and individual-level personal data squarely in the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cache of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/&quot;&gt;tens of millions of Facebook profiles&lt;/a&gt;, along with responses to a personality quiz app linked to Facebook accounts, which was sold to Cambridge Analytica in 2014, by a company called GSR, and used to underpin its psychographic profiling of U.S. voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In evidence to the DCMS committee &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/kogan-i-dont-think-facebook-has-a-developer-policy-that-is-valid/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; GSR’s co-founder, Aleksandr Kogan, argued that Facebook did not have a “valid” developer policy at the time, since he said the company did nothing to enforce the stated T&amp;amp;Cs — meaning users’ data was wide open to misappropriation and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK’s data protection watchdog also took a dim view. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/uk-watchdog-hands-facebook-500k-fine/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; it issued Facebook with the maximum fine possible, under relevant national law, for the CA data breach — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/&quot;&gt;warned in a report that democracy is under threat&lt;/a&gt;. The country’s information commissioner also called for an “ethical pause” of the use of online microtargeting ad tools for political campaigning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/11/brexit-means-clear-your-cookies-for-democracy/&quot;&gt;No such pause has taken place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile for its part, since the Cambridge Analytica scandal snowballed into &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/legislators-from-ten-parliaments-put-the-squeeze-on-facebook/&quot;&gt;global condemnation of its business&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook has made loud claims to be ‘locking down’ its platform — including saying it would conduct an app audit and “investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information”; “conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity”; and “ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, close to two years later, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/facebook-denies-making-contradictory-claims-on-cambridge-analytica-and-other-sketchy-apps/&quot;&gt;still no final report&lt;/a&gt; from the company on the upshot of this self ‘audit’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while Facebook was slapped with a headline-grabbing FTC fine on home soil, there was in fact no proper investigation; no requirement for it to change its privacy-hostile practices; and blanket immunity for top execs — even for any unknown data violations in the 2012 to 2018 period. So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/&quot;&gt;ummm&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another highly curious detail, GSR’s other co-founder, a data scientist called Joseph Chancellor, was in fact hired by Facebook in late 2015. The tech giant has never satisfactorily explained how it came to recruit one of the two individuals at the center of a voter manipulation data misuse scandal which continues to wreak hefty reputational damage on Zuckerberg and his platform. But being able to ensure Chancellor was kept away from the press during a period of intense scrutiny looks pretty convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

John Bolton PAC was the client. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisinsilico?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@chrisinsilico&lt;/a&gt;’s papers to DCMS committee have the emails about delivering the data to Bolton. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NLagY2PWEG&quot;&gt;https://t.co/NLagY2PWEG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— David Carroll 🦅 (@profcarroll) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/profcarroll/status/1213232646060462082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, the GSR co-founder was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90231904/a-facebook-employee-tied-to-cambridge-analytica-quietly-left-facebook&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to have left Facebook — as quietly, and with as little explanation given, as when he arrived on the tech giant’s payroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Kaiser seems quite right to be concerned that the data industrial complex will do anything to keep its secrets — given it’s designed and engineered to sell access to yours. Even as she has her own reasons to want to keep the story in the media spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms whose profiteering purpose is to track and target people at global scale — which function by leveraging an asymmetrical ‘attention economy’ — have zero incentive to change or have change imposed upon them. Not when the propaganda-as-a-service business remains in such high demand, whether for selling actual things like bars of soap, or for hawking ideas with a far darker purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Products I Wish Existed</title>
<link>http://blog.eladgil.com/2020/01/products-i-wish-existed-2020-edition.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.eladgil.com/2020/01/products-i-wish-existed-2020-edition.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Below is a list of products or startups that I am keeping an eye out for. I skipped listing things I wish existed that can *not* be implemented with today's technology in strong form - for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age&quot;&gt;Young Lady's Illustrated Primer&lt;/a&gt; - although weak forms of this may be possible today.&lt;p&gt;A number of these may also turn out to be terrible businesses, and this is not meant as a &quot;trends&quot; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.eladgil.com/2019/01/interesting-markets-2019-edition.html&quot;&gt;&quot;what's hot&quot; post&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, I would adopt a number of the products myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;A. Software.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Trinet for full-time remote/distributed workers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the move to more and more remote workers and teams a number of companies are struggling with basic payroll and benefits for non-US employees. This is particularly true if the company is a startup or has many small teams around the world. There is a lot of complexity in terms of whether someone is an independent contractor or not, setting up foreign subsidiaries and payments, working with a PEO etc. The product would be a modern, easy to use way to hire and pay remote full time (and part-time) teams. You can think of it as &quot;Trinet v2&quot;. Some of the complexity in the product may be driven by the need to establish foreign entities to hire remote workers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.letsdeel.com/&quot;&gt;Deel&lt;/a&gt; is doing a subset for contractors, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://runahr.com/&quot;&gt;RunaHR&lt;/a&gt; is doing payroll in LATAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. New social network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TikTok is a good reminder for the generational turnover of social products. While most social networks have not proven to be durable over time (Friendster, MySpace, Orkut, ....) the ones that take over generational shifts or new content types and formats have become massive companies. In general, most of the value of a social product is the network and interactions of the people using the product, with the remainder of the value coming from the product software scaffolding itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Places to watch for a new social products may include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generational shifts.&lt;/strong&gt; Every 5-7 years there is room for a new social network to emerge in the next wave of high school and college students. TikTok is a good example of this, following SnapChat in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New content and formats.&lt;/strong&gt; The rise of podcasting and transcription, short form content highlighting, or other approaches may yield the right engagement model for a new social product to emerge. Past versions of this include Instagram for mobile photos and Pinterest for pins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming communities. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discordapp.com/&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2019/06/04/is-fortnite-the-new-social-media-home-for-teens/#14c137b059f9&quot;&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/&quot;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; and others have shown the appetite for social networks in the context of gaming. It is always possible a game or gaming-centric network will make the jump to a broadbased one, assuming its features evolve over time to subsume additional use cases. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verticals.&lt;/strong&gt; There is likely room for additional vertical social networks for very large verticals. Neighborhoods in particular still feel like a large potential opportunity over time with the sets of layered information and commerce that can be attached. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextdoor.com/&quot;&gt;Nextdoor&lt;/a&gt; feels a bit like the Myspace of its vertical in that someone could challenge it - however no Facebook of neighborhoods has arisen to challenge it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High user fatigue.&lt;/strong&gt; In parallel, user fatigue around spam, bots, and outrage culture without any controls built to deal with this may create the opening for a new network. What would be a network which allowed for more thoughtful discourse? Or at least the ability to more actively mute topics, threads, and groups of users while surfacing better content algorithmically?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VR.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not near term, but a Black Sun like network could emerge eventually with a rise in VR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past examples relevant for today?&lt;/strong&gt; Things like IRC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL&quot;&gt;the WELL&lt;/a&gt;, and others captured user behavior in unique ways. One aspect was the highly curated or self organized nature of these communities prior to the Internet being deluged by everyone. There is room for a throwback to these more concentrated, in some sense high end intellectual (and non intellectual) communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of the networks that has the cleanest stand alone use case and potential to be worth $100B, the ones which may be displaced or competed with soonest may include (1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which captures both high velocity news, public discourse, and CRM in a single communication and media network. Twitter has not evolved much as a product with basics still missing a decade plus later. (2) LinkedIn. Github should have been a strong competitor to LinkedIn for engineers and designers. There may be ways to try to take over other specific use cases from the company as a starting point.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. More SaaS and Dev Tools.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is kind of obvious, and I suggest analysis to be done below to find opportunities in this area (see &quot;Software areas for exploration). I have specific ideas I may try to help pull together or test in 2020.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. ADT 2.0: Digital neighborhood watch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The common approach to security cameras is to sell the camera as a DIY installation hardware sales and then charge an attach to cloud storage. However, the traditional path to home security includes &lt;em&gt;services-centric&lt;/em&gt; companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adt.com/&quot;&gt;ADT&lt;/a&gt;. ADT will install the hardware for you, have a person in the middle in case needed for monitoring, and spins off cash like crazy due to its subscription model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a modern next-generation consumer-centric ADT-like model. This model would include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Services model. Part of the purchase includes a technician showing up and doing the installation. There would be no DIY component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscription only. The product would be a hardware/software/services bundle with an up front fee and ongoing subscription as default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network driven. All cameras in a neighborhood would be virtually networked - for example, as a user I could report that someone stole packages from my doorstep and an alert would go out to all my neighbors to their phones to bring their own packages inside. There are interesting network effects available here as well as the potential for a neighborhood social product to be built on top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data exhaust. If you have enough camera density by neighborhood, other things suddenly become interesting adjacent businesses. For example, could you add a pollution sensor to installs and get unique and valuable data? Weather data? There are lots of opportunities here outside of home security once you have an installed base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I have long wanted to fund or incubate a company in this area. Nest and Ring are trying to do things on the consumer side, but not quite there yet. A company to watch in an adjacent area is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flocksafety.com/&quot;&gt;Flock Safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Neighborhood (and corporate?) pollution sensor networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relatedly, the California wildfires have caused me as a parent to look frequently at pollution data. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://patrickcollison.com/pollution&quot;&gt;basal pollution levels&lt;/a&gt; may impact cognitive function. There seems to be room for both home/neighborhood and corporate level pollution sensor networks. One could imagine a service where companies or people buy hardware + analytics for their homes or facilities and then a subscription for people who do not own the hardware but live nearby. An early player in this area is &lt;a href=&quot;https://aclima.io/&quot;&gt;Aclima&lt;/a&gt; which has done &lt;a href=&quot;https://aclima.io/press/aclima-google-scale-air-quality-mapping-to-more-places-around-the-world/&quot;&gt;cool things with Google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Climate product bundle for enterprises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bundled climate change product could be sold to enterprises including carbon offsets, carbon sequestration, solar installations, and other climate services. A number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-google-keeps-power-hungry-operations-carbon-neutral/&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20811981/stripe-carbon-capture-climate-change-pay-negative-emissions&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; adopted climate products early, and given employee interest in the area could lead to faster sales cycle then the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, a friend of mine and I put up a consumer carbon offset site back in 2007 due to concerns with global warming. The idea was to help people buy carbon offsets for their own activities. At the time, we saw very little interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an additional aside, Nuclear is a strong potential solution for climate change but is politically unpopular. Could something be done to address this[1]?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Software-only defense contractor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anduril.com/&quot;&gt;Anduril&lt;/a&gt; is a next-generation defense contractor focused on hardware + software (including machine learning) bundles. There is probably room for an adjacent company focused solely on software-centric machine learning and intelligence applications. Unlike Palantir, which seems to have a services-centric model, this new company would be focused on a more SaaS-centric software-driven model. The rise of machine learning and machine vision as analytical tools opens up the door for a new contractor to emerge to challenge incumbents, and also to provide new applications not available in the pre-ML world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;B. Software areas for exploration:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Global 2000 company IT needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Silicon Valley enterprise startups often focus on the needs of other mid-stage tech companies as customers, rather than the large enterprises that make up much of the business world by revenue. There are probably a dozen $10B+ enterprise software companies to build that are unique to the largest companies of the world that most Silicon Valley founders are never exposed to (UIPath is a good example of a company serving such a need).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would love to see the following analysis:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A map of repetitious tasks, spreadsheets, and manual data extraction by function &lt;/strong&gt;in the Fortune 500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget breakdown of current software spend&lt;/strong&gt;, by function, by line, in the Fortune 500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A view of &lt;strong&gt;what Accenture, CapGemini, and Deloitte keep building &lt;/strong&gt;over and over for large enterprises. Undoubtedly a subset of these custom consulting projects can be turned into SaaS software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tougher analysis to do is to ask &lt;strong&gt;what internal software projects various tech companies are working on&lt;/strong&gt;. If you can get the list from 3-4 companies, you will undoubtedly see a few internal tool or product examples that should be built as a SaaS product for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. More RPA and NoCode.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPA (basically tools anyone can use to create programmatic APIs on top of legacy software) and NoCode/LowCode (letting anyone build an app with a spreadsheet as a database representation) are the biggest shifts in enterprise software since the cloud. In a few years, aspects of RPA and NoCode are likely to be incorporated into an increasing proportion of enterprise applications as a standard tool set. While the early leading apps of this area (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uipath.com/&quot;&gt;UIPath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt;, ...) make great headways, additional players like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://parabola.io/&quot;&gt;Parabola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://retool.com/&quot;&gt;Retool&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simpo.com/&quot;&gt;Simpo&lt;/a&gt; continue to take on additional uses cases. There is a lot more room for new players tackling specific use cases or verticals, or add on apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://rossum.ai/&quot;&gt;Rossum&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.instabase.com/&quot;&gt;Instabase&lt;/a&gt; for NLP and data extraction into NoCode &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/templates&quot;&gt;tables and apps like Airtable&lt;/a&gt;, or RPA apps like UIPath.&lt;p&gt;NoCode and RPA are likely to become more verticalized in terms of both function that uses them, and market served. More companies in these markets will emerge in 2020 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;C. Biotech.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although I am no longer helping to start or invest in biotech (outside of my existing involvements), the following strike me as important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Fertility for everyone (and perhaps saving endangered species in the future)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now possible to take a skin cell from a mouse, turn it into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725251&quot;&gt;induced stem cell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20104&quot;&gt;then convert that stem cell into a sperm or egg&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738627&quot;&gt;implications to society&lt;/a&gt; if someone were to translate this to humans is dramatic. Imagine if any person, of any age, could have a child. Women could decide to push back child bearing dramatically without freezing eggs in advance. Gay couples could have kids together with genes from both sides. There are also nefarious uses - for example if you surreptitiously scrape skin off Kanye's hands in a club you might be able to show up 9 months later with a baby and paternity suit. Ovid Research is working on one aspect of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, for endangered species, a non-commercial effort should be made to freeze cells from every living animal (assuming non-disruptive) and also to create embryonic stem cell or germline lines for future use in potential species rescue or rebirth. Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29973581&quot;&gt;white rhino example&lt;/a&gt; of potential proof of concept approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Longevity basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right now the bar for longevity or anti-aging companies is a high one (cure aging!). While each company starts with a specific targeted indication, I sometimes wonder if people are being too bold in application versus ambition. It would be great to want to cure aging, but start really small. The bar for anti-aging may be too high and too science-centric. Are there simple approaches to help people rapidly with off the shelf or repositioned drugs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think companies could set a lower bar and start by restoring function that dramatically improves lots of people's quality of life. Examples would include eyesight and hearing. For example, many people start to get blurry vision in their 40s, due to a variety of factors including the mix of proteins in the lens of the eye causing hardening and potentially the muscle holding the lens aging. Could a simple approach like rapamycin droplets in the eye reverse aspects of aging and therefore eyesight? Similarly, are there treatments that could restore lost hair in men or have other cosmetic applications?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, if you want to join an anti-aging company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioagelabs.com/&quot;&gt;BioAge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springdiscovery.com/&quot;&gt;Spring Discovery&lt;/a&gt; are the two to watch IMO (I am involved with both, as well as a number of other companies mentioned in this post).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;D. Biotech Areas For Exploration:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Biomarkers for everything (wetware and/or AI and digital)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being able to measure a physiological change or response allows you to both understand a disease and its progression, as well as to create drugs to treat the disease. Major conditions such as Alzheimer's disease &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0348-z&quot;&gt;have traditionally been limited&lt;/a&gt; in drug creation due to an inability to find biomarkers that correspond with disease progression. This means that historically Alzheimer's trials have only been able to recruit people with late stages of the disease for trials. It would be useful to do deep proteomic, metabolomic, and potentially methalomic analysis of people with different diseases to start to develop robust biomarkers for all major diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also &quot;electronic&quot; biomarkers that should be developed and put into use. For example, by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/health/breast-cancer-mammogram-artificial-intelligence.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&quot;&gt;machine learning on pictures&lt;/a&gt; or short videos of children can you tell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2019/05/researchers-using-machine-learning-screen-autism-children/&quot;&gt;where they might be on the autism spectrum&lt;/a&gt;? Or can you tell if someone is developing Alzheimer's or other disorders based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alzheimers.net/9-2-14-alzheimers-gait/&quot;&gt;changes in gait&lt;/a&gt; and phone sensors? There is a wealth of digital data we are not using for diagnosis and treatment. The challenge is taking a one-off research study and translating it into an actual product in widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact Sciences is a good example of a colon cancer biomarker that has decreased the needs for colonoscopies while creating a $10 billion+ company. Unfortunately, like everything in healthcare, the road from a great biomarker to commercial success may be long and difficult. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_Sciences_(company)&quot;&gt;Exact Sciences&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1995, when public in 2001, and had a flat market cap for about a decade before in-licensing and developing its colon cancer screen in 2009-2014. A better product alone in healthcare does not mean success or adoption without the right industry body approvals and insurance reimbursement. However, from a human impact perspective this field holds enormous potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[1] For nuclear - an update on the decades old technology used in current reactors (for example molten core reactors or SMRs) + a PR campaign targeting millennials and GenZ seems valuable to do. Maybe you rebrand the newer safer technology something completely unrelated to nuclear? &quot;Green atomics&quot; or the like? When I last looked at nuclear 5-6 years ago, a big cost to build and deploy was largely NIMBYism driven - cost delays due to protests led to uncertain completion timelines, delays, and financing costs. Am upgrade to current technology + PR campaign might help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;RELATED POSTS:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Markets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Startup life:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>SoftBank has walked away from startups, months after submitting term sheets</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/softbank-walk-away-startups-honor-creator-seismic-8d4adc0c-dcfb-42d3-982e-f422a9963be8.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/softbank-walk-away-startups-honor-creator-seismic-8d4adc0c-dcfb-42d3-982e-f422a9963be8.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;SoftBank Vision Fund has walked away from investing in several startups, months after submitting term sheets worth hundreds of millions of dollars and promising that closing delays were only temporary, Axios has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; This is highly unusual behavior, even for the idiosyncratic SoftBank, and threatens its ability to invest in highly sought-after companies. SoftBank, which has invested record amounts into startups over the past few years, confirmed that it has &quot;regret&quot; over these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;hidden-8d4adc0c-dcfb-42d3-982e-f422a9963be8&quot; class=&quot;&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;&quot;Hurry up and wait&quot; is how numerous sources describe negotiations with SoftBank, saying that the process was time-consuming, expensive, and ultimately fruitless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honor&lt;/strong&gt; is a San Francisco home care company for older adults that's raised over $100 million from firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Naspers, and Thrive Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;It received a term sheet from SoftBank in mid-November, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/05/softbank-vision-fund-2-in-talks-to-invest-150-million-in-honor.html&quot; class=&quot;StoryBody__link--10w8x&quot;&gt;subsequent reports&lt;/a&gt; putting the deal size at around $150 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son gave his blessing during a meeting at his Woodside, Calif. estate with Honor CEO Seth Sternberg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Per a source familiar: &quot;SoftBank kept saying it had to run some 'process stuff' before getting the term sheet fully-signed, but said they wanted to get it funded by year-end, so it started confirmatory due diligence—law firms, background checks, EY going through stuff, etc... There was no reason to think there was going to be a problem.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;SoftBank killed the deal one week before Christmas, telling Honor that Son had changed his mind. Son did not personally communicate his decision or rationale to the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seismic&lt;/strong&gt; is a San Diego-based maker of B2B sales software that's raised over $180 million in VC funding, most recently at a $1 billion valuation, from firms like General Atlantic, Jackson Square Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and JMI Equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;It wasn't looking to raise money but, over the summer, SoftBank came with a term sheet that was hard to refuse. High valuation, an opportunity for early investors to sell some secondary stock, and a promise to take Seismic into Japan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;The two sides struck a deal by early August, with CEO Doug Winter getting Son's initial okay via a phone call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;&quot;It was originally supposed to be the last company in Vision Fund 1, but SoftBank kept dragging its feet so suddenly it's supposed to be the first or second deal in Vision Fund 2,&quot; says a source close to the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Winter traveled to Japan in October for an in-person meeting with Son, after which Seismic was given &quot;three more boxes to check... not substantive things —busywork to make things last longer.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;The deal died shortly thereafter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creator&lt;/strong&gt; is a San Francisco-based developer of hamburger-making robots, whose backers include Google Ventures and Khosla Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;SoftBank signed the company to an exclusive, six-month term sheet for a round that was many multiples of the $25 million it had raised to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;&quot;Totally screwed,&quot; is how one source close to Creator refers to what happened next. Like with the other examples, it was unexplained delay after unexplained delay, and at one point said it wanted to add a co-lead investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;The company pushed back, and SoftBank agreed to wire between $10 million and $15 million as a show of good faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;But the &quot;hurry up and wait&quot; persisted, with multiple sources telling me last month that the original deal was dead. Things may have since changed, however, as a source close to SoftBank says negotiations remain active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company executives and investors&lt;/strong&gt; all declined to speak on the record, when contacted by Axios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; SoftBank's reasons for its reversals are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Some sources believe a driving factor is SoftBank's struggle to raise Vision Fund 2. In short, outside money still hasn't materialized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;Vision Fund 2 so far has done five deals, although that all appears to be via SoftBank Group's $38 billion commitment to the fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;StoryBody__item--1cHYD&quot;&gt;They also think the WeWork debacle played a role, creating a sort of shell shock in Tokyo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying ...&lt;/strong&gt; SoftBank sent Axios the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Quote__root--fHvPf Quote__plain--kY7a_&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Given we’re a fiduciary and investing very large amounts of capital, our investment process is more rigorous than unregulated investors and typical VCs.  There have been a few cases where our process took longer than anticipated, which we regret. We’re always upfront with founders about what to expect and we try to keep them informed every step of the way.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;StoryBody__paragraph--2-Doz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; Time is one of a startup's most valuable assets, and several startups and their CEOs have been robbed of time by SoftBank's actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Always Review Your Dependencies, AGPL Edition</title>
<link>https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/always_review_your_dependencies</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/always_review_your_dependencies</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Before adding a dependency to one of my software projects, I do some basic vetting of the dependency. Among the things I check are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is the code licensed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the authors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any serious unresolved issues in the issue tracker?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a history of serious bugs in the issue tracker?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of code review process is used for pull requests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I do a cursory review of the code. I look for anything blatantly insecure or malicious, and try to get a feel for the quality of the code base. I look for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232420&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Brown M&amp;amp;Ms&lt;/a&gt;&quot; - minor inattention to detail that might indicate a larger problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat the above recursively on transitive dependencies as many times as necessary. I also repeat the cursory code review any time I upgrade a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite a bit of work, but is necessary to avoid falling victim to attacks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;event-stream&lt;/a&gt;. I was recently reminded of yet another reason to review dependencies, as I reviewed Duo's &lt;a href=&quot;https://webauthn.io/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;highly-publicized&lt;/a&gt; Go library for WebAuthn, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;github.com/duo-labs/webauthn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started off poorly when I noticed some Brown M&amp;amp;M's: despite being a library, it was logging messages to stdout, and there were several code smells which indicated inexperience with Go. Sure enough, these minor issues foreshadowed a far larger problem: when I started reviewing the transitive dependency github.com/katzenpost/core/crypto/eddsa, I was greeted with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/katzenpost/core/blob/d5cf686c5a7811418262be381d27b43c1fea2e6c/crypto/eddsa/eddsa.go#L1-L15&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;AGPLv3 license header&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was bad news for most people wanting to use Duo's WebAuthn library. Although Duo had licensed their library under a BSD license, when you linked your application with Duo's library, you'd also be linking with the AGPL-licensed library, creating a &quot;modified&quot; work in the eyes of the (A)GPL, thus subjecting your application to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html#section13&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;section 13 of the AGPL&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you used github.com/duo-labs/webauthn in a public-facing web app, your web app had to be open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most galling thing about this dependency is that it's redundant with &lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of Go's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SubRepositories&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;quasi-standard &quot;x&quot; libraries&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, github.com/duo-labs/webauthn originally used golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519. That changed during a pull request from an external collaborator titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn/pull/25&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Consolidate COSE things to their own area&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. In the process of moving some code from one file to another, this pull request subtly changed the implementation of &lt;code&gt;OKPPublicKeyData.Verify&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the old &lt;code&gt;OKPPublicKeyData.Verify&lt;/code&gt;, which uses golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pygments&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Verify Octet Key Pair (OKP) Public Key Signature&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OKPPublicKeyData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;HasherFromCOSEAlg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;COSEAlgorithmIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PublicKeyData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Algorithm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ed25519&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;XCoord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the new &lt;code&gt;OKPPublicKeyData.Verify&lt;/code&gt;, which uses the AGPL-licensed github.com/katzenpost/core/crypto/eddsa:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pygments&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Verify Octet Key Pair (OKP) Public Key Signature&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;eddsa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PublicKey&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;FromBytes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;XCoord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was zero explanation provided for this change. The pull request was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn/pull/25#issuecomment-472051532&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;reviewed by two Duo employees&lt;/a&gt;, who approved and merged it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: this is why I don't like to accept pull requests that move code around. Even if the new code organization is better, it's usually not worth the time it takes to ensure the pull request isn't doing anything extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn/issues/56&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;filed an issue&lt;/a&gt; about the AGPL-licensed dependency, and the developers &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn/pull/58&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;switched back&lt;/a&gt; to using golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519. Nevertheless, I've decided not to use github.com/duo-labs/webauthn. The bulk of the library and its dependencies are to support a WebAuthn misfeature called attestation, which I have less-than-zero desire to use. I just finished writing a vastly simpler, attestation-free library which is less than one tenth the size (I will open source it soon - watch this space).&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sidenote_idm209&quot; class=&quot;sidenote_toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;parens&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;There's another lesson here, which is that complicated &quot;features&quot; like attestation that serve a minority's use case shouldn't be added to Web standards.&lt;span class=&quot;parens&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Developing this library is less costly than the liability of using an existing WebAuthn Go library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident reminded me of why I like programming in Go. Go's extensive standard library, along with its quasi-standard &quot;x&quot; libraries, mean that the dependency graph of my projects is typically quite small. The bulk of my trust is consolidated in the Go project, and thanks to their stellar reputation and solid operating procedures, I don't feel a need to review the source code of the Go compiler and standard libraries. Even though I love Rust, I am terrified every time I look at the dependency graph of a typical Rust library: I usually see dozens of transitive dependencies written by Internet randos whom I have zero reason to trust. Vetting all those dependencies takes far too much time, which is why I'm much less productive in Rust than Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note: as a fan of verifiable data structures like Certificate Transparency, I have to love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/25530-sumdb.md&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;new Go checksum database&lt;/a&gt;. However, the checksum database does you no good if you don't take the time to review your dependencies. Unfortunately, I've already seen one over-enthusiastic Go user claim that the Go checksum database solves all problems with dependency management. It doesn't. There's no easy way around this basic fact: you have to review your dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
