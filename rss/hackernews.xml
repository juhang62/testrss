<description>&lt;p&gt;The questions we often hear are “Why create a new query language?” and “What’s wrong with SQL?”. This post contains answers to both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, let’s overview some of the history of how the relational model came to be, and how SQL was created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql&quot; readability=&quot;98.866636731028&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-brief-history-of-the-relational-model-and-sql&quot; class=&quot; src-components-header_link----header_link-module---header---1h6HM&quot;&gt;A Brief History of the Relational Model and SQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relational model was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in a seminal 1970 paper “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id1&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1970&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. There, Codd postulated that all data in a database can be represented in terms of sets of tuples, called &lt;em&gt;relations&lt;/em&gt;. Codd also invented a form of first-order predicate logic to describe the database queries: &lt;em&gt;tuple relational calculus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codd’s ideas were revolutionary. For the first time, a database, and a universal way to query it, was described in a succinct, consistent mathematical model. This, naturally, created lots of interest in further research and, importantly, into practical implementation of the relational model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1974 Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce published a paper &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id2&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-1974&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, which introduced “a set of simple operations on tabular structures, […] of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus”. Chamberlin and Boyce felt that the formal relational query languages proposed at the time were too hard to understand for “users without formal training in mathematics or computer programming” and thought that the “predominant use of the language would be for ad-hoc queries” &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id3&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fchamberlin-2012&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. Initially, the authors did not consider SQL to be a “serious” language. Nonetheless, the great interest in the commercial application of the relational model had pushed IBM to quickly adopt and productize SQL, which was also picked up by their quickly-rising competitor–Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM had an overwhelmingly large influence over the tech market at the time, so SQL became a de facto standard for relational databases, and then a proper standard with the publication of the first ANSI standard in 1989 that essentially circumscribed the most prominent existing implementations of SQL. Subsequent versions of the standard continued to be primarily influenced by the commercial vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, SQL is by far the most widely used database language. But that does not necessarily mean that it represents the best of what we can do. In fact, SQL’s beginnings as a “simple, ad-hoc” language coupled with “design by implementation” from competing vendors had left the language with a baggage of severe issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;critique-of-sql&quot; readability=&quot;146.81441737154&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL, especially its earlier versions, was heavily criticized by the experts, including Codd himself &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id4&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, as well as C. J. Date, who published a multitude of papers and books on the subject (&lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id5&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1985&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id6&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id7&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-2009&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;). While many of the early shortcomings were fixed in the later versions of the standard, some of the serious issues had been only further ingrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the complaints here apply to SQL as a whole, while others are specific to a certain implementation. We are primarily using PostgreSQL for the examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL’s shortcomings can be grouped into these categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lack of proper orthogonality — SQL is hard to compose;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lack of compactness — SQL is a large language;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lack of consistency — SQL is inconsistent in syntax and semantics;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;poor system cohesion — SQL does not integrate well enough with application languages and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_section---aDpQC&quot; id=&quot;lack-of-orthogonality&quot; readability=&quot;83&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways. A language with good orthogonality is smaller, more consistent, and is easier to learn due to there being few exceptions from the overall set of rules. Conversely, bad orthogonality leads to a large language with many exceptions and caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of orthogonality in a programming language is the ability to substitute an arbitrary part of an expression with a variable, or a function call, without any effect on the final result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SQL, such generic substitution is not possible, since there are &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; mutually incompatible kinds of expressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;table expression&lt;/em&gt; is a SQL expression that yields a table: &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM table&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;scalar expression&lt;/em&gt; is a SQL expression that yields a single scalar value: &lt;code&gt;SELECT count(*) FROM table&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table expressions can only be used in a &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt; clause, in a function, or with an operator that specifically expects a table expression as input. What’s worse the scalar and table expressions may have exactly the same syntax, which can be a source of further confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s imagine we needed to list the names of all department heads in a company. This query would do the job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-sql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; name
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; emp
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; role &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'dept head'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say we needed to add this bit to a larger query that extracts information about a department. An intuitive way is to simply add the above as a subquery to the target list of our larger query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-sql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    dept&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; name &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; emp
     &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; role &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'dept head'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; deptno &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dept&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;
    dept
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is legal, but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the subquery returns not more than one row. Otherwise, an error would be raised at run time. To account for multiple department heads, we would need to rewrite the query using a join:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-sql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;
    dept&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
    head&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;name
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;
    dept
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;INNER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;JOIN&lt;/span&gt; emp &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; head
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;deptno &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dept&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; head&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;role &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'dept head'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in structure is large enough to make any sort of source-level query reuse impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few claim that SQL is an elegant language characterized by orthogonality. Some call it an elephant on clay feet. With each addition, its body grows, and it becomes less stable. SQL standardization is largely the domain of database vendors, not academic researchers without commercial interests or users with user interests. &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id8&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fatzeni-2013&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---attribution---3SQ4F&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paolo Atzeni et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL is not a small language. At the time of writing the PostgreSQL implementation contains &lt;strong&gt;469 keywords&lt;/strong&gt;. Just part 2 (out of 14) of the SQL:2016 standard has &lt;strong&gt;1732 pages&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason is that SQL, in line with its original goals, strives to be an English-like language, catered to “non-professionals”. However, with the growth of the language, this verbosity has contributed &lt;em&gt;negatively&lt;/em&gt; to the ability to write and comprehend SQL queries. We learnt this lesson with COBOL, and the world has long since moved on to newer, more succinct programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to keyword proliferation, the orthogonality issues discussed above make queries more verbose and harder to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_section---aDpQC&quot; id=&quot;lack-of-consistency&quot; readability=&quot;52&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL is arbitrarily inconsistent both in its syntax and semantics. What makes things even worse is that different databases have their own version of SQL, often incompatible with other SQL variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of entirely different calling conventions in SQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-sql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; substring&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'PostgreSQL'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; substring&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'PostgreSQL'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; trim&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;both &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'yxSQLxx'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'xyz'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; extract&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;day&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'2001-02-16 20:38:40'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two syntaxes that specify the ordering of the input set in an aggregate function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of inconsistencies like this does not end here and can be continued, but that’s beyond the scope of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases of inadequate handling of missing information, the problem is incorrectly perceived to be a problem of the relational model. In fact, the problem stems from the inadequacies of SQL and its non-conformance to the relational model. &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id9&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1990&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---attribution---3SQ4F&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgar J. Codd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been extensively argued that &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; is the biggest misfeature of SQL (&lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id10&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fcodd-1987&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id11&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1986&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;[&lt;a id=&quot;id12&quot; href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#fdate-1987&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;). In fact, the handling of &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; in contemporary SQL implementations is so surprising, inconsistent, and dangerous that this topic deserves a separate section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; is so special that it’s not equal to anything, including itself:&lt;/p&gt;

 ?column?
----------

(1 row)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, almost any operation on &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; and the effect may be very subtle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in some cases &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; equal to itself, such as in &lt;code&gt;DISTINCT&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the traditional logic and boolean algebra rules cannot be safely applied to SQL boolean expressions in the presence of &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the law of excluded middle, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; OR NOT &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, does not evaluate to true if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The the row containing &lt;code&gt;b=3&lt;/code&gt; is classified either as &lt;code&gt;'one'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'not one'&lt;/code&gt; even though the construction of the &lt;code&gt;CASE&lt;/code&gt; expression appears equivalent in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rows containing &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; sometimes get counted, and sometimes not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rows containing &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; cannot be compared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even &lt;code&gt;IS NULL&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, the databases often uses &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; to indicate an error condition, so your query might contain &lt;code&gt;NULLs&lt;/code&gt; even if you don’t expect them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;

(1 row)

postgres=# SELECT to_char(timestamp '2001-02-16 20:38:40', '');
 to_char
---------

(1 row)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PostgreSQL division by zero is an exception, whereas MySQL simply returns &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;

+-------+

+-------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more cases like these, and there is no consistency in a single SQL implementation, let alone across all implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;why-does-all-this-matter&quot; readability=&quot;60&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so we have highlighted the shortcomings of SQL. Why do they matter? It’s all about &lt;em&gt;ergonomics&lt;/em&gt;. Orthogonality, compactness, and consistency are all &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; traits of a programming language that is easy to learn and use effectively on every level of expertise, team size, and project complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have become accustomed to a constant improvement and reimagination of programming languages. Swift, Rust, Kotlin, Go, just to name a few, are great examples in the advancement of engineer ergonomics and productivity. But SQL, often hidden behind layers of ORMs and frameworks, is still very much the dominant data language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NoSQL movement was born, in part, out of the frustration with the perceived stagnation and inadequacy of SQL databases. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of ditching SQL, the NoSQL approaches also abandoned the relational model and other &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; parts of RDBMSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;edgeql-query-language-evolution&quot; readability=&quot;83.896276595745&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relational model is still the most generally applicable and effective method of representing data. The concept of SQL as a declarative, storage-neutral query language is powerful and versatile. We don’t need to abandon either. What we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need is a “better SQL”: a query language that affords more power to its users, but that is also simpler and more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is exactly what we are working hard to achieve with &lt;strong&gt;EdgeQL&lt;/strong&gt;. We spent years of research and development, focusing on usability and performance without compromising correctness. In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-1/&quot;&gt;earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; we described some of the great features of the language, but it’s worth getting into some detail here to highlight how we are solving the issues brought up in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_section---aDpQC&quot; id=&quot;orthogonality-consistency-and-compactness&quot; readability=&quot;65.973180076628&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In EdgeQL &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/overview#everything-is-a-set&quot;&gt;every value is a set&lt;/a&gt; and every expression is a function over sets, returning a set. This means that, syntactically, any part of an EdgeQL expression can be factored out into a view or a function without changing other parts of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a query returning movies together with the number of reviews for each one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-edgeql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; Movie {
    description,
    number_of_reviews &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;(.reviews)
};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we need the average number of reviews across all movies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-edgeql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; math::&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;(
    Movie {
        description,
        number_of_reviews &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;(.reviews)
    }.number_of_reviews
);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; need the maximum number of reviews per movie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-edgeql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; (
    avg &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; math::&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;(
        Movie {
            number_of_reviews &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;(.reviews)
        }.number_of_reviews
    ),
    &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;(
        Movie {
            number_of_reviews &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;(.reviews)
        }.number_of_reviews
    )
);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tad unwieldy, let’s make the query cleaner by factoring out the &lt;code&gt;Movie&lt;/code&gt; expression into a view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---code---1IzoY src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax code-language-edgeql eql-block-pre src-components-code----code-module---block---aABGx&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;src-components-code----code-module---wrapper---3ZlaG&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tokens tokens-normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WITH&lt;/span&gt;
    MovieReviewCount &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; Movie {
        number_of_reviews &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;(.reviews)
    }
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; (
    avg &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; math::&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;(MovieReviewCount.number_of_reviews),
    &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token definition punctuation&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;(MovieReviewCount.number_of_reviews),
);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since everything is a function over sets, there are only a handful of keywords in EdgeQL queries, and they are used mostly to delineate the major parts of a query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_section---aDpQC&quot; id=&quot;missing-data&quot; readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In EdgeQL, the notion of missing data is simple: it is always an empty set, and any element-wise operation on an empty set is, likewise, an empty set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax src-components-code----code-module---repl---7611z&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation is consistent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In EdgeQL, sets are flat, i.e. a set (including an empty one) cannot be an element of another set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;src-styles----blog-post-module---rest_border_box---2usPO prismjs-light-syntax src-components-code----code-module---repl---7611z&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set constructor notation above is actually equivalent to a &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt; operation, which better highlights its set nature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An empty set can be coalesced into a non-empty set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In EdgeDB, the data schema is formulated in a way that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/docs/tutorial/createdb#sdl&quot;&gt;much closer&lt;/a&gt; to the contemporary application data model. This makes the database-application schema reflection straightforward and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike SQL, EdgeQL can easily extract arbitrary data trees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupled with extensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/docs/datamodel/scalars/json#constructing-json-values&quot;&gt;JSON support&lt;/a&gt;, this makes writing REST and &lt;a href=&quot;https://edgedb.com/docs/clients/99_graphql/index&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; backends an order of magnitude easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQL started with a goal to empower non-programmers to work with the relational data effectively. Despite its shortcomings, it has arguably been wildly successful, with most databases implementing or emulating it. However, like any solution, SQL is facing increasing inadequacy in the support of the new requirements, modes of use and user productivity. It is time we do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why open source firmware is important for security</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, May 8, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk recently at GoTo Chicago on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qees556dT9LNoooEdf6En8V82L3V-_N8LbPuyGihZeI/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;Why open source firmware is important&lt;/a&gt; and I thought it would be nice to also write a blog post with my findings. This post will focus on why open source firmware is important for security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;privilege-levels&quot;&gt;Privilege Levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your typical “stack” today you have the various levels of privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ring 3 - Userspace:&lt;/strong&gt; has the least amount of privileges, short of there being a sandbox in userspace that is restricted further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ring 0 - Kernel:&lt;/strong&gt; The operating system kernel, for open source operating systems you get visibility into the code behind this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ring -1 - Hypervisor:&lt;/strong&gt; The virtual machine monitor (VMM) that creates and runs virtual machines. For open source hypervisors like Xen, KVM, bhyve, etc you have visibility into the code behind this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ring -2 -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;System Management Mode (SMM), UEFI kernel:&lt;/strong&gt; Proprietary code, more on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/why-open-source-firmware-is-important-for-security/#ring-2-smm-uefi-kernel&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ring -3 - Management Engine:&lt;/strong&gt; Proprietary code, more on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/why-open-source-firmware-is-important-for-security/#ring-3-management-engine&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The negative rings were made up because there was no other way to express something with more privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above, it’s pretty clear that for Rings -1 to 3, we have the option to use open source software and have a large amount of visibility and control over the software we run. For the privilege levels under Ring -1, we have less control but it is getting better with the open source firmware community and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s counter-intuitive that the code that we have the least visibility into has the most privileges. This is what open source firmware is aiming to fix.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ring-2-smm-uefi-kernel&quot;&gt;Ring -2: SMM, UEFI kernel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ring controls all CPU resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System management mode (SMM)&lt;/strong&gt; is invisible to the rest of the stack on top of it. It has half a kernel. It was originally used for power management and system hardware control. It holds a lot of the proprietary designed code and is a place for vendors to add new proprietary features. It handles system events like memory or chipset errors as well as a bunch of other logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;UEFI Kernel&lt;/strong&gt; is extremely complex. It has millions of lines of code. UEFI applications are active after boot. It was built with security from obscurity. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://uefi.org/specifications&quot;&gt;specification&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely insane if you want to dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ring-3-management-engine&quot;&gt;Ring -3: Management Engine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most privileged ring. In the case of Intel (x86) this is the Intel Management Engine. It can turn on nodes and re-image disks invisibly. It has a kernel that runs &lt;a href=&quot;https://itsfoss.com/fact-intel-minix-case/&quot;&gt;Minix 3&lt;/a&gt; as well as a web server and entire networking stack. It turns out Minix is the most widely used operating system because of this. There is a lot of functionality in the Management Engine, it would probably take me all day to list it off but there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000008927/software/chipset-software.html&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://files.bitkeks.eu/docs/intelme-report.pdf&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; for digging into more detail, should you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between Ring -2 and Ring -3 we have at least 2 and a half other kernels in our stack as well as a bunch of proprietary and unnecessary complexity. Each of these kernels have their own networking stacks and web servers. The code can also modify itself and persist across power cycles and re-installs. &lt;strong&gt;We have very little visibility into what the code in these rings is actually doing, which is horrifying considering these rings have the most privileges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;they-all-have-exploits&quot;&gt;They all have exploits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be of no surprise to anyone that Rings -2 and -3 have their fair share of vulnerabilities. They are horrifying when they happen though. Just to use one as an example although I will let you find others on your own, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/05/hack-brief-intel-fixes-critical-bug-lingered-7-dang-years/&quot;&gt;there was a bug in the web server of the Intel Management Engine that was there for seven years&lt;/a&gt; without them realizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-we-make-it-better&quot;&gt;How can we make it better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nerf-non-extensible-reduced-firmware&quot;&gt;NERF: Non-Extensible Reduced Firmware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NERF is what the open source firmware community is working towards. The goals are to make firmware less capable of doing harm and make its actions more visible. They aim to remove all runtime components but currently with the Intel Management Engine, they cannot remove all but they can take away the web server and IP stack. They also remove UEFI IP stack and other drivers, as well as the Intel Management/UEFI self-reflash capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;me-cleaner&quot;&gt;me_cleaner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the project used to clean the Intel Management Engine to the smallest necessary capabilities. You can check it out on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner&quot;&gt;github.com/corna/me_cleaner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;u-boot-and-coreboot&quot;&gt;u-boot and coreboot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/developers/u-boot&quot;&gt;u-boot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreboot.org/&quot;&gt;coreboot&lt;/a&gt; are open source firmware. They handle silicon and DRAM initialization. Chromebooks use both, coreboot on x86, and u-boot for the rest. This is one part of how they &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42038.pdf&quot;&gt;verify boot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coreboot’s design philosophy is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.coreboot.org/&quot;&gt;“do the bare minimum necessary to ensure that hardware is usable and then pass control to a different program called the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.coreboot.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;payload&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.coreboot.org/&quot;&gt;.”&lt;/a&gt; The payload in this case is linuxboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;linuxboot&quot;&gt;linuxboot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxboot.org/&quot;&gt;Linuxboot&lt;/a&gt; handles device drivers, network stack, and gives the user a multi-user, multi-tasking environment. It is built with Linux so that a single kernel can work for several boards. Linux is already quite vetted and has a lot of eyes on it since it is used quite extensively. Better to use a open kernel with a lot of eyes on it, than the 2½ other kernels that were all different and closed off. This means that we are lessening the attack surface by using less variations of code and we are making an effort to rely on code that is open source. Linux improves boot reliability by replacing lightly-tested firmware drivers with hardened Linux drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using a kernel we already have tooling around firmware devs can build in tools they already know. When they need to write logic for signature verification, disk decryption, etc it’s in a language that is modern, easily auditable, maintainable, and readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;u-root&quot;&gt;u-root&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/u-root/u-root&quot;&gt;u-root&lt;/a&gt; is a set of golang userspace tools and bootloader. It is then used as the initramfs for the Linux kernel from linuxboot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through using the NERF stack they saw boot times were 20x faster. But this blog post is on security so let’s get back to that….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NERF stack helps improve the visibility into a lot of the components that were previously very proprietary. There is still a lot of other firmware on devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-all-the-other-firmware&quot;&gt;What about all the other firmware?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need open source firmware for the network interface controller (NIC), solid state drives (SSD), and base management controller (BMC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the NIC, there is some work being done in the open compute project on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-nic-3-0-draft-0v85b-20181213b-tn-temp-no-cb-pdf&quot;&gt;NIC 3.0&lt;/a&gt;. It should be interesting to see where that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the BMC, there is both &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc&quot;&gt;OpenBMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/u-root/u-bmc&quot;&gt;u-bmc&lt;/a&gt;. I had written a little about them in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/the-firmware-rabbit-hole/&quot;&gt;a previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to have all open source firmware to have all the visibility into the stack but also to actually verify the state of software on a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;roots-of-trust&quot;&gt;Roots of Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the root of trust should be to verify that the software installed in every component of the hardware is the software that was intended. This way you can know without a doubt and verify if hardware has been hacked. Since we have very little to no visibility into the code running in a lot of places in our hardware it is hard to do this. How do we really know that the firmware in a component is not vulnerable or that is doesn’t have any backdoors? Well we can’t. Not unless it was all open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every cloud and vendor seems to have their own way of doing a root of trust. Microsoft has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Project_Olympus/tree/master/Project_Cerberus&quot;&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, Google has &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/titan-in-depth-security-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon has &lt;a href=&quot;https://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2019/02/aws-nitro-system/&quot;&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;. These seem to assume an explicit amount of trust in the proprietary code (the code we cannot see). This leaves me with not a great feeling. &lt;strong&gt;Wouldn’t it be better to be able to use all open source code? Then we could verify without a doubt that the code you can read and build yourself is the same code running on hardware for all the various places we have firmware. We could then verify that a machine was in a correct state without a doubt of it being vulnerable or with a backdoor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder what the smaller cloud providers like DigitalOcean or Packet have for a root of trust. Often times we only hear of these projects from the big three or five. I asked this on twitter and didn’t get any good answers…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;5.693023255814&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’m surprised how many people are responding that they love DigitalOcean but seem entirely unconcerned there’s no answer here. You should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great talk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PaulM&quot;&gt;Paul McMillan&lt;/a&gt; and Matt King on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEVVRkd-wPM&quot;&gt;Securing Hardware at Scale&lt;/a&gt;. It covers in great detail how to secure bare metal while also giving customers access to the bare metal. When they get back the hardware from customers they need to ensure with consistency and reliability that there is nothing from the customer hiding in any component of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All clouds need to ensure that the hardware they are running has not been compromised after a customer has run compute on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;platform-firmware-resiliency&quot;&gt;Platform Firmware Resiliency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as chip vendors go, they seem to have a different offering. Intel has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/solution-briefs/firmware-resilience-blocks-solution-brief.pdf&quot;&gt;Platform Firmware Resilience&lt;/a&gt; and Lattice has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latticesemi.com/en/Solutions/Solutions/SolutionsDetails02/PFR&quot;&gt;Platform Firmware Resiliency&lt;/a&gt;. These seem to be more focused on the NIST guidelines for &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-193.pdf&quot;&gt;Platform Firmware Resiliency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to ask the internet who was using this and heard very little back, so if you are using Platform Firmware Resiliency can you let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;4.8729281767956&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It seems that Intel has some effort called Platform Firmware Resiliency (anyone using this one?!) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fQq2gdLNOm&quot;&gt;https://t.co/fQq2gdLNOm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencompute.org/files/Intel-System-Firmware-InnovationsMohanKumar-OCP18.pdf&quot;&gt;OCP talk on Intel’s firmware innovations&lt;/a&gt;, it seems Intel’s Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR) and Cerberus go hand in hand. Intel is using PFR to deliver Cerberus’ attestation priniciples. Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_msw_&quot;&gt;@msw&lt;/a&gt; for the clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if there were not so many tools to do this job. I also wish the code was open source so we could verify for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-help&quot;&gt;How to help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this gave you some insight into what’s being built with open source firmware and how making firmware open source is important! If you would like to help with this effort, please help spread the word. Please try and use platforms that value open source firmware components. Chromebooks are a great example of this, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/&quot;&gt;Purism&lt;/a&gt; computers. You can ask your providers what they are doing for open source firmware or ensuring hardware security with roots of trust. Happy nerding! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to the open source firmware community for helping me along this journey! Shout out to Ron Minnich, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/qrs&quot;&gt;Trammel Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hugelgupf&quot;&gt;Chris Koch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kc8apf&quot;&gt;Rick Altherr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_zaolin_&quot;&gt;Zaolin&lt;/a&gt;. And shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout&quot;&gt;Bridget Kromhout&lt;/a&gt; for always finding time to review my posts!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>All Chromebooks will also be Linux laptops going forward</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-chromebooks-will-also-be-linux-laptops-going-forward/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt; in Mountain View, Google quietly let slip that &quot;all devices [Chromebook] launched this year will be Linux-ready right out of the box.&quot; Wait. What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you've missed it, last year, Google started making it possible to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-comes-to-chromebooks/&quot;&gt;run desktop Linux on Chrome OS&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, more Chromebook devices are able to run Linux. Going forward, all of them will be able to do so, too. Yes. All of them. ARM and Intel-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't surprising. Chrome OS, after all, is built on Linux. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-secret-origins-of-googles-chrome-os/&quot;&gt;Chrome OS started as a spin off of Ubuntu Linux&lt;/a&gt;. It then migrated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gentoo.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gentoo Linux&lt;/a&gt; and evolved into Google's own take on the vanilla Linux kernel. But its interface remains the Chrome web browser UI -- to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, you could run Debian, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubuntu.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kali.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kali Linux&lt;/a&gt; on Chrome OS using the open-source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Crouton&lt;/a&gt; program in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/change_root&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;chroot&lt;/a&gt; container. Or, you could run &lt;a href=&quot;https://galliumos.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Gallium OS&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party, Xubuntu Chromebook-specific Linux variant. But it wasn't easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now? It's as simple as simple can be. Just open the Chrome OS app switcher by pressing the Search/Launcher key and then type &quot;Terminal&quot;. This launches the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/board-overlays/+/master/project-termina/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Termina&lt;/a&gt; VM, which will start running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStretch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Debian 9.0 Stretch&lt;/a&gt; Linux container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You're now running Debian Linux on your Chromebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want Ubuntu instead? It's a bit more trouble, but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/wiki/howto/run-ubuntu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;bring up Ubuntu with a few shell commands&lt;/a&gt;. Want to run, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfedora.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;? You can run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/comments/as9igv/fedora_wiki/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fedora with Chrome OS&lt;/a&gt;, as well. For more tips and tricks with running Linux on Chrome OS, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reddit Crostini&lt;/a&gt; sub-reddit. It's the best end-user Linux on Chromebook site around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux on Chromebook laptops is not a dual-boot operation. You're running both operating systems simultaneously.  That means, for example, you can do things like clicking on a document file via the Chrome OS file manager and open it with LibreOffice -- without even starting a Linux session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with the latest canary Chrome OS release, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/ChromeOS-io19.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;file manager to move your files across Chrome OS, Google Drive, Linux, and Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes. Android, too. Chrome OS has long supported Android apps. With this latest canary (read alpha) release, Google boosts its Android compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;img aspect-set&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2019/05/08/80a4532a-7591-47b8-9718-aadd7b3ea18b/fb072ed4fae0171f7bd92f58ff997bdf/chrome-os-android-linux.jpg&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;One Chromebook, Three operating systems at once: Android, Chrome OS and Linux.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;sjvn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Must read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also now use port forwarding to connect networking services between Linux and Chrome OS. This means, you could, for example, run a web server within the Linux container while debugging it on the same machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why would you want to do this? If you're a developer, the answer's easy: You can develop for all three operating systems off one platform. For example, it's now much easier to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt; on Chrome OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Chrome OS 77,  you also now have secure USB support for Android phones. With this, you can develop, debug, and push your Android Application Package (APK) to Android phones on any of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio#Requirements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Android developer-recommended Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chromebook with all three operating systems running at once is also darn useful for an ordinary Jane or Joe. For example, I can edit images using Linux &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gimp.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; and write with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;LibreOffice Writer&lt;/a&gt; while looking at pictures using Android &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pinterest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; and simultaneously check my Gmail in Chrome OS. It's all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromebook laptops are more useful than ever with Android and Linux. Heck, with that many Chromebook devices out there with Linux built-in, maybe 2019 will be -- yes, I'm going to say it -- the year of the Linux desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PostgreSQL 11.3 and 10.8</title>
<link>https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1939/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1939/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Posted on &lt;strong&gt;2019-05-09&lt;/strong&gt; by PostgreSQL Global Development Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported versions of our database system, including 11.3, 10.8, 9.6.13, 9.5.17, and 9.4.22. This release fixes two security issues in the PostgreSQL server, a security issue found in two of the PostgreSQL Windows installers, and over 60 bugs reported over the last three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users who installed PostgreSQL using the Windows installers from EnterpriseDB and BigSQL respectively should upgrade as soon as possible. Similarly, users who are running any version of PostgreSQL 9.5, 9.6, 10, and 11 should also plan to upgrade as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other users should plan to apply this update at the next scheduled downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four security vulnerabilities have been closed by this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10127&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-10127&lt;/a&gt;: BigSQL Windows installer does not clear permissive ACL entries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10128&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-10128&lt;/a&gt;: EnterpriseDB Windows installer does not clear permissive ACL entries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to both the EnterpriseDB and BigSQL Windows installers not locking down the permissions of the PostgreSQL binary installation directory and the data directory, an unprivileged Windows user account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account could cause the PostgreSQL service account to execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is present in all supported versions of PostgreSQL for these installers, and possibly exists in older versions. Both sets of installers have fixed the permissions for these directories for both new and existing installations. If you have installed PostgreSQL on Windows using other methods, we advise that you check that your PostgreSQL binary directories are writable only to trusted users and that your data directories are only accessible to trusted users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL project thanks Conner Jones for reporting this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this release, a user running PostgreSQL 11 can read arbitrary bytes of server memory by executing a purpose-crafted INSERT statement to a partitioned table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling data available in columns; this data is consulted during the query planning process. Prior to this release, a user able to execute SQL queries with permissions to read a given column could craft a leaky operator that could read whatever data had been sampled from that column. If this happened to include values from rows that the user is forbidden to see by a row security policy, the user could effectively bypass the policy. This is fixed by only allowing a non-leakproof operator to use this data if there are no relevant row security policies for the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is present in PostgreSQL 9.5, 9.6, 10, and 11. The PostgreSQL project thanks Dean Rasheed for reporting this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug Fixes and Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update also fixes over 60 bugs that were reported in the last several months. Some of these issues affect only version 11, but many affect all supported versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these fixes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several catalog corruption fixes, including one related to running &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE&lt;/code&gt; on a partitioned table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several fixes for partitioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid server crash when an error occurs while trying to persist a cursor query across a transaction commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid O(N^2) performance issue when rolling back a transaction that created many tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix possible “could not access status of transaction” failures in &lt;code&gt;txid_status()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix updatable views to handle explicit DEFAULT items in &lt;code&gt;INSERT .. VALUES&lt;/code&gt; statements where there are multiple VALUES rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix CREATE VIEW to allow zero-column views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add missing support for the &lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS .. AS EXECUTE ..&lt;/code&gt; statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that sub-SELECTs appearing in row-level-security policy expressions are executed with the correct user's permissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept XML documents as valid values of type xml when xmloption is set to content, as required by SQL:2006 and later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix incompatibility of GIN-index WAL records that were introduced in 11.2, 10.7, 9.6.12, 9.5.16, and 9.4.21 that affected replica servers running these versions reading in changes to GIN indexes from primary servers of older versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several memory leak fixes as well as fixes to management of dynamic shared memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relax panics on fsync and sync_file_range failures for certain cases where a failure indicated &quot;operation not supported&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several fixes to the query planner, several of which should lead to planning improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix race condition in which a hot-standby postmaster could fail to shut down after receiving a smart-shutdown request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several fixes for SCRAM authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix handling of &lt;code&gt;lc_time&lt;/code&gt; settings that imply an encoding different from the database's encoding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;current_logfiles&lt;/code&gt; file with the same permissions as other files in the server's &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several ecpg fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make &lt;code&gt;pg_verify_checksums&lt;/code&gt; verify that the data directory it's pointed at is of the right PostgreSQL version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several fixes for &lt;code&gt;contrib/postgres_fdw&lt;/code&gt;, including one for remote partitions where an UPDATE could lead to incorrect results or a crash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Windows fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This update also contains tzdata release 2019a for DST law changes in Palestine and Metlakatla, plus historical corrections for Israel. Etc/UCT is now a backward-compatibility link to Etc/UTC, instead of being a separate zone that generates the abbreviation UCT, which nowadays is typically a typo. PostgreSQL will still accept UCT as an input zone abbreviation, but it won't output it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use &lt;code&gt;pg_upgrade&lt;/code&gt; in order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional, post-update steps; please see the release notes for earlier versions for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 9.4 will stop receiving fixes on February 13, 2020. Please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/&quot;&gt;versioning policy&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>When Engineers Become Whistleblowers</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/when-engineers-become-whistleblowers/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asce.org/question-of-ethics-articles/apr-2008/&quot;&gt;“Fundamental Canon No. 1”&lt;/a&gt; of the American Society of Engineers states that “Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” Most engineering societies have this principle in their codes of ethics. This duty frames the decades of struggles by conscientious engineers—whether employees or consultants—who strive to balance professional ethics with &lt;em&gt;occupational&lt;/em&gt; survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the technologically stagnant dark days in the auto industry of cruel suppression of technical dissent over safety and toxic emissions, a censorship that carried over to the industry-controlled Society of Automotive Engineers, today’s engineers are working in an improved environment for taking their conscience to work. Yet much more remains to be done to safeguard the ability of engineers to speak truth to the powers-that-be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, the word &lt;em&gt;whistleblower&lt;/em&gt;—once popularly meant to describe a snitch or a disgruntled employee—now describes an ethical person willing to put his or her job on the line in order to expose corrupt, illegal, fraudulent and harmful activities. Indeed, in the aftermath of recent Boeing 737 MAX crashes, the media routinely and positively refers to disclosures by “Boeing whistleblowers.” Congressional investigating committees and federal agencies have called for whistleblowers to come forward and shed light on corporate misdeeds and governmental agency lapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it mildly, this was not always the case. In 1971, I convened the Conference on Professional Responsibility—a sober name for a group of whistleblowers from corporations, government and unions. They were ragged as “malcontents” or “occupational-suiciders.” In fact, they were courageous, accurate, morally right, and willing to lose everything to expose wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynoters at the whistleblower conference were Senator William Proxmire, who protected government whistleblowers on military defense issues, and Robert Townsend, author of the best-selling &lt;em&gt;Up the Organization.&lt;/em&gt; Townsend drew from his business experience to explain the critical role whistleblowing could play in giant corporations. Law Professor Arthur Miller reviewed the lack of legal protection and vulnerability of whistleblowers and presented what the law should provide “in its institutions and principles.” (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10873630&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whistle Blowing: The Report of the Conference on Professional Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Ralph Nader, Peter Petkas and Kate Blackwell, 1972).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this watershed conference, much began to change. Numerous health and safety statutes now protect government employees who report noncompliance with environmental, worker safety and labor standards. Starting in 1978, a Merit System Protection Board was established and later strengthened under President George Herbert Walker Bush to give federal employees some, but not enough, due process against retaliation. Several states followed with their own whistleblower protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977 an NGO called the Government Accountability Project (GAP) started offering &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt; representation to many government and corporate whistleblowers. After the enactment of the 1986 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Claims_Act&quot;&gt;False Claims Act&lt;/a&gt;, federal employees exposing fraud against the government were able to secure a sizable portion of any resultant verdict or settlement against those ripping off the taxpayers. This law alone has recovered over $60 billion from the fraudsters. Private law firms and the Justice Department are regularly involved in pursuing these claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast world of state and federal procurement/military contracts and infrastructure is known to be rife with “waste, fraud and abuse.” Engineers are most likely to see such violations first. Decades ago, foreshadowing the many challenges in engineering, the Society of Professional Engineers, in its code of ethics, instructed engineers on their obligation to report safety and fraud violations to the appropriate outside authorities, should they find no recourse inside their place of employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With $5 trillion of deferred maintenance for our public works, as measured by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the challenges to the assertion of engineering conscientiousness will be ever larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more public interest engineering advocacy groups and initiatives to open up new frontiers of excellence and service as well as to support engineers inside the corporate framework. It was a Caltech professor, Arie Jan Haagen-Smit, not GM engineers or chemists, who proved in the 1950s the connection between motor vehicles and the lethal photochemical smog over the cities and suburbs of California. This led to smog-control regulations and ethical and legal foundations for industrial air pollution controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineer &lt;a href=&quot;http://whirlwindwheelchair.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ralf Hotchkiss&lt;/a&gt;, rendered a paraplegic before college, courageously revolutionized the functional and economical design of superior wheelchairs, including showing natives how to utilize local materials in poor countries. He also helped break the virtual wheelchair monopoly of a British multinational company in the process. We need more engineers who embody the three principles of any profession—independence, scholarly pursuits, and commitment to public service. Those are the vital ethical pillars to helping engineers withstand the great pressures to place commercial priorities over their engineering integrity and limit harm to the public. We see the push to relegate engineers to indentured status in industries such as the chemical, nuclear, weapons systems, mining, auto, aviation, railroad and medical devices industries, as well as the new unregulated areas of biotechnology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been progress in legal protections for whistleblowers, more civil litigations and, importantly, higher public expectations and popular support for these unsung protectors. There is, however, much more work to do, especially in educating the engineering school curricula and encouraging the numerous engineering societies to take their codes of ethics seriously. But as Nassim Taleb, author of &lt;em&gt;The Black Swan,&lt;/em&gt; has written, “Mental clarity is the child of courage, not the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, in an address to a chapter of the American Society of Engineering Education (reprinted in the new book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328442837_Ethics_Politics_and_Whistleblowing_in_Engineering&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ethics, Politics, and Whistleblowing in Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; by Nicholas Sakellariou and Rania Milleron [my niece], CRC Press), I said “the [engineering] profession must assert itself towards its most magnificent aspirations—for so much of our future is in your trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, isn’t that a great understatement today!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>We got banned from PayPal after 12 years of business</title>
<link>https://blog.niteo.co/paypal-ban-after-12-years/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.niteo.co/paypal-ban-after-12-years/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;You’d think that being a &lt;strong&gt;legitimate online business&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;having 12 years of history with PayPal&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;hundreds of thousands of dollars processed&lt;/strong&gt;, you’d gain some credibility with them. Not so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our company was banned with a generic “breaking terms of use” email. After calling their support twice, explaining the situation and asking for a reason, we have received nothing but “the decision is final, and we will not provide more information”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.niteo.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/paypalban-1024x934.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-681&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;365&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.niteo.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/paypalban-1024x934.png 1024w, https://blog.niteo.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/paypalban-300x274.png 300w, https://blog.niteo.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/paypalban-768x701.png 768w, https://blog.niteo.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/paypalban.png 1052w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our account &lt;strong&gt;has not been limited or flagged once in these 12 years&lt;/strong&gt;. We have processed hundreds of thousands of dollars in online subscriptions for our software services. The most interesting thing is that we’ve moved away from PayPal in the last two years and have only been receiving some minor payments and paying for a few online services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never thought this would happen and have absolutely no clue what they’re referring. We have reviewed the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;terms of use (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#r09&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user agreement&lt;/a&gt; multiple times and there is absolutely nothing there that we’ve engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not kid yourself – &lt;strong&gt;your business is never, never safe with PayPal&lt;/strong&gt;. Move away or at least have a plan B in place so that you don’t lose your business over their arbitrary actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were lucky that we have moved away from PayPal for actual business revenue, otherwise the consequences could’ve been devastating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chris Hughes Says It’s Time to Break Up Facebook</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;The last time I saw Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; was in the summer of 2017, several months before the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal broke&lt;/a&gt;. We met at &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/chris-hughes-facebook.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook’s&lt;/a&gt; Menlo Park, Calif., office and drove to his house, in a quiet, leafy neighborhood. We spent an hour or two together while his toddler daughter cruised around. We talked politics mostly, a little about &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/business/facebook-response-chris-hughes.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, a bit about our families. When the shadows grew long, I had to head out. I hugged his wife, Priscilla, and said goodbye to Mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since then, Mark’s personal reputation and the reputation of Facebook have taken a nose-dive. The company’s mistakes — the sloppy privacy practices that dropped tens of millions of users’ data into a political consulting firm’s lap; the slow response to Russian agents, violent rhetoric and fake news; and the unbounded drive to capture ever more of our time and attention — dominate the headlines. It’s been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven’t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;css-1e767xm e1gnsphs0&quot; id=&quot;link-2a69115c&quot;&gt;Watch: A founder of Facebook says it should be broken up.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1t0v8sy etkm6pg0&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1a74oa6 etkm6pg1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1ihorw etkm6pg2&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/autossell/op-chris/op-chris-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Video player loading&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, says the company is so big and powerful that it threatens our democracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-cch8ym&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;emkp2hg2 css-1nwzsjy e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark is still the same person I watched hug his parents as they left our dorm’s common room at the beginning of our sophomore year. He is the same person who procrastinated studying for tests, fell in love with his future wife while in line for the bathroom at a party and slept on a mattress on the floor in a small apartment years after he could have afforded much more. In other words, he’s human. But it’s his very humanity that makes his unchecked power so problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government. He controls three core communications platforms — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/business/facebook-response-chris-hughes.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Instagram and WhatsApp — that billions of people use every day. Facebook’s board works more like an advisory committee than an overseer, because Mark &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/11/19/18099011/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-stock-nyt-wsj&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;controls around 60 percent of voting shares&lt;/a&gt;. Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook’s algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1upla3o etf134l0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark’s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark is a good, kind person. But I’m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks. I’m disappointed in myself and the early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the News Feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders. And I’m worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook’s explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive. Any day now, the Federal Trade Commission is expected to impose a $5 billion fine on the company, but that is not enough; nor is Facebook’s offer to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/technology/facebook-ftc-settlement.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;appoint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/technology/facebook-ftc-settlement.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;some kind of privacy czar&lt;/a&gt;. After Mark’s congressional testimony last year, there should have been calls for him to truly reckon with his mistakes. Instead the legislators who questioned him were derided as too old and out of touch to understand how tech works. That’s the impression Mark wanted Americans to have, because it means little will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be. Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is time to break up Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;We already have the tools&lt;/strong&gt; we need to check the domination of Facebook. We just seem to have forgotten about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;America was built on the idea that power should not be concentrated in any one person, because we are all fallible. That’s why the founders created a system of checks and balances. They didn’t need to foresee the rise of Facebook to understand the threat that gargantuan companies would pose to democracy. Jefferson and Madison were voracious readers of Adam Smith, who believed that monopolies prevent the competition that spurs innovation and leads to economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A century later, in response to the rise of the oil, railroad and banking trusts of the Gilded Age, the Ohio Republican John Sherman said on the floor of Congress: “If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessities of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity.” The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 outlawed monopolies. More legislation followed in the 20th century, creating legal and regulatory structures to promote competition and hold the biggest companies accountable. The Department of Justice broke up monopolies like Standard Oil and AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For many people today, it’s hard to imagine government doing much of anything right, let alone breaking up a company like Facebook. This isn’t by coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Starting in the 1970s, a small but dedicated group of economists, lawyers and policymakers sowed the seeds of our cynicism. Over the next 40 years, they financed a network of think tanks, journals, social clubs, academic centers and media outlets to teach an emerging generation that private interests should take precedence over public ones. Their gospel was simple: “Free” markets are dynamic and productive, while government is bureaucratic and ineffective. By the mid-1980s, they had largely managed to relegate energetic antitrust enforcement to the history books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This shift, combined with business-friendly tax and regulatory policy, ushered in a period of mergers and acquisitions that created megacorporations. In the past 20 years, more than 75 percent of American industries, from airlines to pharmaceuticals, have experienced increased &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2612047&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concentration&lt;/a&gt;, and the average size of public companies has tripled. The results are a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/business/economy/startup-business.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;decline in entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/29/upshot/why-is-productivity-so-weak-three-theories.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;stalled productivity growth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.janeeckhout.com/wp-content/uploads/RMP.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;higher prices and fewer choices&lt;/a&gt; for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The same thing is happening in social media and digital communications. Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability. This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment and, finally, resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;In 2005, I was in Facebook’s first office,&lt;/strong&gt; on Emerson Street in downtown Palo Alto, when I read the news that Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation was acquiring the social networking site Myspace for $580 million. The overhead lights were off, and a group of us were pecking away on our keyboards, our 21-year-old faces half-illuminated by the glow of our screens. I heard a “whoa,” and the news then ricocheted silently through the room, delivered by AOL Instant Messenger. My eyes widened. Really, $580 million?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook was competing with Myspace, albeit obliquely. We were focused on college students at that point, but we had real identities while Myspace had fictions. Our users were more engaged, visiting daily, if not hourly. We believed Facebook surpassed Myspace in quality and would easily displace it given enough time and money. If Myspace was worth $580 million, Facebook could be worth at least double.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Journalists kept close watch as social media became big business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;From our earliest days, Mark used the word “domination” to describe our ambitions, with no hint of irony or humility. Back then, we competed with a whole host of social networks, not just Myspace, but also Friendster, Twitter, Tumblr, LiveJournal and others. The pressure to beat them spurred innovation and led to many of the features that distinguish Facebook: simple, beautiful interfaces, the News Feed, a tie to real-world identities and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1upla3o etf134l0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;From our earliest days, Mark used the word “domination” to describe our ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was this drive to compete that led Mark to acquire, over the years, dozens of other companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. There was nothing unethical or suspicious, in my view, in these moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One night during the summer of the Myspace sale, I remember driving home from work with Mark, back to the house we shared with several engineers and designers. I was in the passenger seat of the Infiniti S.U.V. that our investor Peter Thiel had bought for Mark to replace the unreliable used Jeep that he had been driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As we turned right off Valparaiso Avenue, Mark confessed the immense pressure he felt. “Now that we employ so many people …” he said, trailing off. “We just really can’t fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook had gone from a project developed in our dorm room and chaotic summer houses to a serious company with lawyers and a human resources department. We had around 50 employees, and their families relied on Facebook to put food on the table. I gazed out the window and thought to myself, &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;It’s never going to stop. The bigger we get, the harder we’ll have to work to keep growing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Over a decade later, Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world’s social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category. This explains why, even during the annus horribilis of 2018, Facebook’s earnings per share increased by an astounding 40 percent compared with the year before. (I liquidated my Facebook shares in 2012, and I don’t invest directly in any social media companies&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook’s monopoly is also visible in its usage statistics. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/social-media/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;About 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of American adults use social media, and a vast majority are on Facebook products. Over two-thirds use the core site, a third use Instagram, and a fifth use WhatsApp. By contrast, fewer than a third report using Pinterest, LinkedIn or Snapchat. What started out as lighthearted entertainment has become the primary way that people of all ages communicate online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even when people want to quit Facebook, they don’t have any meaningful alternative, as we saw in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Worried about their privacy and lacking confidence in Facebook’s good faith, users across the world started a “Delete Facebook” movement. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, a quarter deleted their accounts from their phones, but many did so only temporarily. I heard more than one friend say, “I’m getting off Facebook altogether — thank God for Instagram,” not realizing that Instagram was a Facebook subsidiary. In the end people did not leave the company’s platforms en masse. After all, where would they go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;Facebook’s dominance is not an accident of history.&lt;/strong&gt; The company’s strategy was to beat every competitor in plain view, and regulators and the government tacitly — and at times explicitly — approved. In one of the government’s few attempts to rein in the company, the F.T.C. in 2011 issued a consent decree that Facebook not share any private information beyond what users already agreed to. Facebook largely ignored the decree. Last month, the day after the company predicted in an earnings call that it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/technology/facebook-ftc-fine-privacy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;would need to pay&lt;/a&gt; up to $5 billion as a penalty for its negligence — a slap on the wrist — Facebook’s shares surged 7 percent, adding $30 billion to its value, six times the size of the fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.T.C.’s biggest mistake was to allow Facebook to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp. In 2012, the newer platforms were nipping at Facebook’s heels because they had been built for the smartphone, where Facebook was still struggling to gain traction. Mark responded by buying them, and the F.T.C. approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Neither Instagram nor WhatsApp had any meaningful revenue, but both were incredibly popular. The Instagram acquisition guaranteed Facebook would preserve its dominance in photo networking, and WhatsApp gave it a new entry into mobile real-time messaging. Now, the founders of Instagram and WhatsApp have left the company after &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-15-months-of-fresh-hell/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clashing&lt;/a&gt; with Mark over his management of their platforms. But their former properties remain Facebook’s, driving much of its recent growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When it hasn’t acquired its way to dominance, Facebook has used its monopoly position to shut out competing companies or has copied their technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The News Feed algorithm reportedly &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2017/03/13/facebook-native-video-gets-10x-more-shares-than-youtube/#421ef8c41c66&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prioritized&lt;/a&gt; videos created through Facebook over videos from competitors, like YouTube and Vimeo. In 2012, Twitter introduced a video network called Vine that featured six-second videos. That same day, Facebook blocked Vine from hosting a tool that let its users search for their Facebook friends while on the new network. The decision hobbled Vine, which shut down four years later&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Snapchat posed a different threat. Snapchat’s Stories and impermanent messaging options made it an attractive alternative to Facebook and Instagram. And unlike Vine, Snapchat wasn’t interfacing with the Facebook ecosystem; there was no obvious way to handicap the company or shut it out. So Facebook simply copied it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook’s version of Snapchat’s stories and disappearing messages proved wildly successful, at Snapchat’s expense. At an all-hands meeting in 2016, Mark told Facebook employees not to let their pride get in the way of giving users what they want. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to Wired magazine&lt;/a&gt;, “Zuckerberg’s message became an informal slogan at Facebook: ‘Don’t be too proud to copy.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;(There is little regulators can do about this tactic: Snapchat patented its “ephemeral message galleries,” but copyright law does not extend to the abstract concept itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1upla3o etf134l0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Would-be competitors can’t raise the money to take on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As a result of all this, would-be competitors can’t raise the money to take on Facebook. Investors realize that if a company gets traction, Facebook will copy its innovations, shut it down or acquire it for a relatively modest sum. So despite an extended economic expansion, increasing interest in high-tech start-ups, an explosion of venture capital and growing public distaste for Facebook, no major social networking company has been founded since the fall of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As markets become more concentrated, the number of new start-up businesses declines. This holds true in other high-tech areas dominated by single companies, like search (controlled by Google) and e-commerce (taken over by Amazon). Meanwhile, there has been plenty of innovation in areas where there is no monopolistic domination, such as in workplace productivity (Slack, Trello, Asana), urban transportation (Lyft, Uber, Lime, Bird) and cryptocurrency exchanges (Ripple, Coinbase, Circle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I don’t blame Mark for his quest for domination. He has demonstrated nothing more nefarious than the virtuous hustle of a talented entrepreneur. Yet he has created a leviathan that crowds out entrepreneurship and restricts consumer choice. It’s on our government to ensure that we never lose the magic of the invisible hand. How did we allow this to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;Since the 1970s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;courts have become increasingly hesitant&lt;/strong&gt; to break up companies or block mergers unless consumers are paying inflated prices that would be lower in a competitive market. But a narrow reliance on whether or not consumers have experienced price gouging fails to take into account the full cost of market domination. It doesn’t recognize that we also want markets to be competitive to encourage innovation and to hold power in check. And it is out of step with the history of antitrust law. Two of the last major antitrust suits, against AT&amp;amp;T and IBM in the 1980s, were grounded in the argument that they had used their size to stifle innovation and crush competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As the Columbia law professor Tim Wu &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://globalreports.columbia.edu/books/the-curse-of-bigness/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, “It is a disservice to the laws and their intent to retain such a laserlike focus on price effects as the measure of all that antitrust was meant to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook is the perfect case on which to reverse course, precisely because Facebook makes its money from targeted advertising, meaning users do not pay to use the service. But it is not actually free, and it certainly isn’t harmless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1upla3o etf134l0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We pay for Facebook with our data and our attention, and by either measure it doesn’t come cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook’s business model is built on capturing as much of our attention as possible to encourage people to create and share more information about who they are and who they want to be. We pay for Facebook with our data and our attention, and by either measure it doesn’t come cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I was on the original News Feed team (my name is on the patent), and that product now gets billions of hours of attention and pulls in unknowable amounts of data each year. The average Facebook user spends &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/6/25/17501224/instagram-facebook-snapchat-time-spent-growth-data&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an hour a day&lt;/a&gt; on the platform; Instagram users spend 53 minutes a day scrolling through pictures and videos. They create immense amounts of data — not just likes and dislikes, but how many seconds they watch a particular video — that Facebook uses to refine its targeted advertising. Facebook also &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;collects&lt;/a&gt; data from partner companies and apps, without most users knowing about it, according to testing by The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some days, lying on the floor next to my 1-year-old son as he plays with his dinosaurs, I catch myself scrolling through Instagram, waiting to see if the next image will be more beautiful than the last. What am I doing? I know it’s not good for me, or for my son, and yet I do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The choice is mine, but it doesn’t feel like a choice. Facebook seeps into every corner of our lives to capture as much of our attention and data as possible and, without any alternative, we make the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The vibrant marketplace that once drove Facebook and other social media companies to compete to come up with better products has virtually disappeared. This means there’s less chance of start-ups developing healthier, less exploitative social media platforms. It also means less accountability on issues like privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Just last month, Facebook seemingly &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/04/19/u-s-authorities-target-zuckerberg-as-instagram-security-breach-hits-millions/#64e13edf5062&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried to bury news&lt;/a&gt; that it had stored tens of millions of user passwords in plain text format, which thousands of Facebook employees could see. Competition alone wouldn’t necessarily spur privacy protection — regulation is required to ensure accountability — but Facebook’s lock on the market guarantees that users can’t protest by moving to alternative platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;The most problematic aspect of Facebook’s power&lt;/strong&gt; is Mark’s unilateral control over speech. There is no precedent for his ability to monitor, organize and even censor the conversations of two billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook engineers write algorithms that select which users’ comments or experiences end up displayed in the News Feeds of friends and family. These rules are proprietary and so complex that many Facebook employees themselves don’t understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2014, the rules favored curiosity-inducing “clickbait” headlines. In 2016, they enabled the spread of fringe political views and fake news, which made it easier for Russian actors to manipulate the American electorate. In January 2018, Mark announced that the algorithms would favor non-news content shared by friends and news from “trustworthy” sources, which his engineers &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-15-months-of-fresh-hell/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interpreted&lt;/a&gt; — to the confusion of many — as a boost for anything in the category of “politics, crime, tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook has responded to many of the criticisms of how it manages speech by hiring thousands of contractors to enforce the rules that Mark and senior executives develop. After a few weeks of training, these contractors decide which videos count as hate speech or free speech, which images are erotic and which are simply artistic, and which live streams are too violent to be broadcast. (The Verge &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that some of these moderators, working through a vendor in Arizona, were paid $28,800 a year, got limited breaks and faced significant mental health risks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As if Facebook’s opaque algorithms weren’t enough, last year we learned that Facebook executives had permanently deleted their own messages from the platform, erasing them from the inboxes of recipients; the justification was corporate security concerns. When I look at my years of Facebook messages with Mark now, it’s just a long stream of my own light-blue comments, clearly written in response to words he had once sent me. (Facebook now offers this as a feature to all users.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The most extreme example of Facebook manipulating speech happened in Myanmar in late 2017&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Mark &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17204324/zuckerberg-facebook-myanmar-rohingya-hate-speech-open-letter&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a Vox interview&lt;/a&gt; that he personally made the decision to delete the private messages of Facebook users who were encouraging genocide there. “I remember, one Saturday morning, I got a phone call,” he said, “and we detected that people were trying to spread sensational messages through — it was Facebook Messenger in this case — to each side of the conflict, basically telling the Muslims, ‘Hey, there’s about to be an uprising of the Buddhists, so make sure that you are armed and go to this place.’ And then the same thing on the other side.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark made a call: “We stop those messages from going through.” Most people would agree with his decision, but it’s deeply troubling that he made it with no accountability to any independent authority or government. Facebook could, in theory, delete en masse the messages of Americans, too, if its leadership decided it didn’t like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark used to insist that Facebook was just a “social utility,” a neutral platform for people to communicate what they wished. Now he recognizes that Facebook is both a platform and a publisher and that it is inevitably making decisions about values. The company’s own lawyers have argued in court that Facebook is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/02/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-platform-publisher-lawsuit&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a publisher&lt;/a&gt; and thus entitled to First Amendment protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;No one at Facebook headquarters is choosing what single news story everyone in America wakes up to, of course. But they do decide whether it will be an article from a reputable outlet or a clip from “The Daily Show,” a photo from a friend’s wedding or an incendiary call to kill others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark knows that this is too much power and is pursuing a twofold strategy to mitigate it. He is pivoting Facebook’s focus toward encouraging more &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18524188/facebook-f8-keynote-mark-zuckerberg-privacy-future-2019&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;private&lt;/a&gt;, encrypted messaging that Facebook’s employees can’t see, let alone control. Second, he is hoping for friendly oversight from regulators and other industry executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Late last year, he proposed an independent commission to handle difficult content moderation decisions by social media platforms. It would afford an independent check, Mark argued, on Facebook’s decisions, and users could appeal to it if they disagreed. But its decisions would not have the force of law, since companies would voluntarily participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.2fe1d8be682f&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;op-ed essay in The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; in March, he wrote, “Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and I agree.” And he went even further than before, calling for more government regulation — not just on speech, but also on privacy and interoperability, the ability of consumers to seamlessly leave one network and transfer their profiles, friend connections, photos and other data to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1upla3o etf134l0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook isn’t afraid of a few more rules. It’s afraid of an antitrust case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I don’t think these proposals were made in bad faith. But I do think they’re an attempt to head off the argument that regulators need to go further and break up the company. Facebook isn’t afraid of a few more rules. It’s afraid of an antitrust case and of the kind of accountability that real government oversight would bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We don’t expect calcified rules or voluntary commissions to work to regulate drug companies, health care companies, car manufacturers or credit card providers. Agencies oversee these industries to ensure that the private market works for the public good. In these cases, we all understand that government isn’t an external force meddling in an organic market; it’s what makes a dynamic and fair market possible in the first place. This should be just as true for social networking as it is for air travel or pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;In the summer of 2006, Yahoo offered us $1 billion&lt;/strong&gt; for Facebook. I desperately wanted Mark to say yes. Even my small slice of the company would have made me a millionaire several times over. For a 22-year-old scholarship kid from small-town North Carolina, that kind of money was unimaginable. I wasn’t alone — just about every other person at the company wanted the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was taboo to talk about it openly, but I finally asked Mark when we had a moment alone, “How are you feeling about Yahoo?” I got a shrug and a one-line answer: “I just don’t know if I want to work for Terry Semel,” Yahoo’s chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Outside of a couple of gigs in college, Mark had never had a real boss and seemed entirely uninterested in the prospect. I didn’t like the idea much myself, but I would have traded having a boss for several million dollars any day of the week. Mark’s drive was infinitely stronger. Domination meant domination, and the hustle was just too delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mark may never have a boss, but he needs to have some check on his power. The American government needs to do two things: break up Facebook’s monopoly and regulate the company to make it more accountable to the American people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;First, Facebook should be separated into multiple companies. The F.T.C., in conjunction with the Justice Department, should enforce antitrust laws by undoing the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and banning future acquisitions for several years. The F.T.C. should have blocked these mergers, but it’s not too late to act. There is precedent for correcting bad decisions — as recently as 2009, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wholefoods-ftc/whole-foods-ftc-settle-on-wild-oats-merger-idUSTRE5253AL20090306&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Whole Foods settled antitrust complaints&lt;/a&gt; by selling off the Wild Oats brand and stores that it had bought a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There is some evidence that we may be headed in this direction. Senator Elizabeth Warren has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for reversing the Facebook mergers, and in February, the F.T.C. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/26/18241491/ftc-task-force-tech-monopolies-bureau-competition-online-platforms&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the creation of a task force to monitor competition among tech companies and review previous mergers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;How would a breakup work? Facebook would have a brief period to spin off the Instagram and WhatsApp businesses, and the three would become distinct companies, most likely publicly traded. Facebook shareholders would initially hold stock in the new companies, although Mark and other executives would probably be required to divest their management shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Until recently, WhatsApp and Instagram were administered as independent platforms inside the parent company, so that should make the process easier. But time is of the essence: Facebook is working quickly to integrate the three, which would make it harder for the F.T.C. to split them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;Some economists are&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://qz.com/280197/meet-the-economics-nobelist-who-explains-net-neutrality-and-the-ios-app-store/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that breaking up Facebook would spur that much competition, because Facebook, they say, is a “natural” monopoly. Natural monopolies have emerged in areas like water systems and the electrical grid, where the price of entering the business is very high — because you have to lay pipes or electrical lines — but it gets cheaper and cheaper to add each additional customer. In other words, the monopoly arises naturally from the circumstances of the business, rather than a company’s illegal maneuvering. In addition, defenders of natural monopolies often make the case that they benefit consumers because they are able to provide services more cheaply than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook is indeed more valuable when there are more people on it: There are more connections for a user to make and more content to be shared. But the cost of entering the social network business is not that high. And unlike with pipes and electricity, there is no good argument that the country benefits from having only one dominant social networking company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Still others worry that the breakup of Facebook or other American tech companies could be a national security problem. Because advancements in artificial intelligence require immense amounts of data and computing power, only large companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon can afford these investments, they say. If American companies become smaller, the Chinese will outpace us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While serious, these concerns do not justify inaction. Even after a breakup, Facebook would be a hugely profitable business with billions to invest in new technologies — and a more competitive market would only encourage those investments. If the Chinese did pull ahead, our government could invest in research and development and pursue tactical trade policy, just as it is doing today to hold China’s 5G technology at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The cost of breaking up Facebook would be next to zero for the government, and lots of people stand to gain economically. A ban on short-term acquisitions would ensure that competitors, and the investors who take a bet on them, would have the space to flourish. Digital advertisers would suddenly have multiple companies vying for their dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Facebook is more valuable when there are more people on  it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jim Wilson/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even Facebook shareholders would probably benefit, as shareholders often do in the years after a company’s split. The value of the companies that made up Standard Oil doubled within a year of its being dismantled and had increased by fivefold a few years later. Ten years after the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;amp;T, the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1992/07/27/76697/index.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;value&lt;/a&gt; of its successor companies had tripled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the biggest winners would be the American people. Imagine a competitive market in which they could choose among one network that offered higher privacy standards, another that cost a fee to join but had little advertising and another that would allow users to customize and tweak their feeds as they saw fit. No one knows exactly what Facebook’s competitors would offer to differentiate themselves. That’s exactly the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Justice Department faced similar questions of social costs and benefits with AT&amp;amp;T in the 1950s. AT&amp;amp;T had a monopoly on phone services and telecommunications equipment. The government filed suit under antitrust laws, and the case ended with a consent decree that required AT&amp;amp;T to release its patents and refrain from expanding into the nascent computer industry. This resulted in an explosion of innovation, greatly &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.monika-schnitzer.com/uploads/4/9/4/1/49415675/watzinger_etal_0219.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; follow-on patents and leading to the development of the semiconductor and modern computing. We would most likely not have iPhones or laptops without the competitive markets that antitrust action ushered in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Adam Smith was right: Competition spurs growth and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;Just breaking up Facebook is not enough.&lt;/strong&gt; We need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies. Its first mandate should be to protect privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Europeans have made headway on privacy with the General Data Protection Regulation, a law that guarantees users a minimal level of protection&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; A landmark privacy bill in the United States should specify exactly what control Americans have over their digital information, require clearer disclosure to users and provide enough flexibility to the agency to exercise effective oversight over time. The agency should also be charged with guaranteeing basic interoperability across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, the agency should create guidelines for acceptable speech on social media. This idea may seem un-American — we would never stand for a government agency censoring speech. But we already have limits on yelling “fire” in a crowded theater, child pornography, speech intended to provoke violence and false statements to manipulate stock prices. We will have to create similar standards that tech companies can use. These standards should of course be subject to the review of the courts, just as any other limits on speech are. But there is no constitutional right to harass others or live-stream violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;css-1upla3o etf134l0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1plcdrk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If we don’t have public servants shaping these policies, corporations will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These are difficult challenges. I worry that government regulators will not be able to keep up with the pace of digital innovation. I worry that more competition in social networking might lead to a conservative Facebook and a liberal one, or that newer social networks might be less secure if government regulation is weak. But sticking with the status quo would be worse: If we don’t have public servants shaping these policies, corporations will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Over two days in April 2018, nearly 100 lawmakers questioned Mark Zuckerberg. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Brenner/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some people doubt that an effort to break up Facebook would win in the courts, given the hostility on the federal bench to antitrust action, or that this divided Congress would ever be able to muster enough consensus to create a regulatory agency for social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But even if breakup and regulation aren’t immediately successful, simply pushing for them will bring more oversight. The government’s case against Microsoft — that it illegally used its market power in operating systems to force its customers to use its web browser, Internet Explorer — ended in 2001 when George W. Bush’s administration abandoned its effort to break up the company. Yet that prosecution helped rein in Microsoft’s ambitions to dominate the early web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Similarly, the Justice Department’s 1970s suit accusing IBM of illegally maintaining its monopoly on personal computer sales ended in a stalemate. But along the way, IBM changed many of its behaviors. It stopped bundling its hardware and software, chose an extremely open design for the operating system in its personal computers and did not exercise undue control over its suppliers. Professor Wu has written that this “policeman at the elbow” led IBM to steer clear “of anything close to anticompetitive conduct, for fear of adding to the case against it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We can expect the same from even an unsuccessful suit against Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, an aggressive case against Facebook would persuade other behemoths like Google and Amazon to think twice about stifling competition in their own sectors, out of fear that they could be next. If the government were to use this moment to resurrect an effective competition standard that takes a broader view of the full cost of “free” products, it could affect a whole host of industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The alternative is bleak. If we do not take action, Facebook’s monopoly will become even more entrenched. With much of the world’s personal communications in hand, it can mine that data for patterns and trends, giving it an advantage over competitors for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10&quot;&gt;I take responsibility for not sounding the alarm earlier.&lt;/strong&gt; Don Graham, a former Facebook board member, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://time.com/5505433/donald-graham-facebook/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has accused&lt;/a&gt; those who criticize the company now as having “all the courage of the last man leaping on the pile at a football game.” The financial rewards I reaped from working at Facebook radically changed the trajectory of my life, and even after I cashed out, I watched in awe as the company grew. It took the 2016 election fallout and Cambridge Analytica to awaken me to the dangers of Facebook’s monopoly. But anyone suggesting that Facebook is akin to a pinned football player misrepresents its resilience and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;An era of accountability for Facebook and other monopolies may be beginning. Collective anger is growing, and a new cohort of leaders has begun to emerge. On Capitol Hill, Representative David Cicilline has taken a special interest in checking the power of monopolies, and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ted Cruz have joined Senator Warren in calling for more oversight. Economists like Jason Furman, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, are speaking out about monopolies, and a host of legal scholars like Lina Khan, Barry Lynn and Ganesh Sitaraman are plotting a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This movement of public servants, scholars and activists deserves our support. Mark Zuckerberg cannot fix Facebook, but our government can.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;f grisly images&lt;/span&gt; stay up on Facebook or YouTube long enough, self-appointed detectives around the world sometimes use them to reconstruct a crime scene. In July 2017, a video capturing the execution of 18 people appeared on Facebook. The clip opened with a half-dozen armed men presiding over several rows of detainees. Dressed in bright-orange jumpsuits and black hoods, the captives knelt in the gravel, hands tied behind their back. They never saw what was coming. The gunmen raised their weapons and fired, and the first row of victims crumpled to the earth. The executioners repeated this act four times, following the orders of a confident young man dressed in a black cap and camouflage trousers. If you slowed the video down frame by frame, you could see that his black T-shirt bore the logo of the Al-Saiqa Brigade, an elite unit of the Libyan National Army. That was clue No. 1: This happened in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Facebook took down the bloody video, whose source has yet to be conclusively determined, shortly after it surfaced. But it existed online long enough for copies to spread to other social-networking sites. Independently, human-rights activists, prosecutors, and other internet users in multiple countries scoured the clip for clues and soon established that the killings had occurred on the outskirts of Benghazi. The ringleader, these investigators concluded, was Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf al-Werfalli, an Al-Saiqa commander. Within a month, the International Criminal Court had charged Werfalli with the murder of 33 people in seven separate incidents—from June 2016 to the July 2017 killings that landed on Facebook. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2017_05031.PDF&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;the ICC arrest warrant&lt;/a&gt;, prosecutors relied heavily on digital evidence collected from social-media sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Werfalli has thus far evaded justice. But human-rights activists still hail the case as a breakthrough for a powerful new tool: online open-source investigations. Even in no-go combat zones, war crimes and other abuses often leave behind an information trail. By piecing together information that becomes publicly accessible on social media and other sites, internet users can hold the perpetrators accountable—that is, unless algorithms developed by the tech giants expunge the evidence first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/free-speech-online-is-at-risk-after-paris-attacks/417411/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Shutting down jihadist websites won’t stop terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Werfalli arrest warrant was issued, Hadi Al Khatib, a Syrian-born open-source investigator based in Berlin, noticed something that distressed him: User-generated videos depicting firsthand accounts from the war in Syria were vanishing from the internet by the thousands. Khatib is the founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://syrianarchive.org/en&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;Syrian Archive&lt;/a&gt;, a collective of activists that, since 2014, has been scouring for digital materials posted by people left behind in Syria’s war zone. The Syrian Archive’s aim is “to build a kind of visual documentation relating to human-rights violations and other crimes committed by all sides during the eight-year-old conflict,” Khatib said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late summer of 2017, Khatib and his colleagues were systematically building a case against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in much the same way ICC investigators pursued Werfalli. They had amassed scores and scores of citizens’ accounts, including video and photos that purportedly showed Assad was targeting hospitals and medical clinics in bombing campaigns. “We were collecting, archiving, and geolocating evidence, doing all sorts of verification for the case,” Khatib recalled. “Then one day we noticed that all the videos that we had been going through, all of a sudden, all of them were gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a sophisticated hack attack by pro-Assad forces that wiped out their work. It was the ruthlessly efficient work of machine-learning algorithms deployed by social networks, particularly YouTube and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/dont-shut-down-internets-biggest-jihadi-archive/577630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;Graeme Wood: Don’t shut down the internet’s biggest jihadist archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;W&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;ith some reluctance&lt;/span&gt;, technology companies in Silicon Valley have taken on the role of prosecutors, judges, and juries in decisions about which words and images should be banished from the public’s sight. Lately, tech companies have become almost as skilled at muzzling speech as they are at enabling it. This hasn’t gone unnoticed by government entities that are keen to transform social networks into listening posts. Government, in effect, is “subcontracting” social-media platforms to be its eyes and ears on all kinds of content it deems objectionable, says Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, a law professor and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;special rapporteur for the United Nations Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of what governments ask tech companies to do, such as suppressing violent content, cuts against other legitimate goals, such as bringing warlords and dictators to justice. Balancing these priorities is hard enough when humans are making judgments in accordance with established legal norms. In contrast, tech giants operate largely in the dark. They are governed by opaque terms-of-service policies that, more and more, are enforced by artificial-intelligence tools developed in-house with little to no input from the public. “We don’t even know what goes into the algorithms, what kind of in-built biases and structures there are,” Ní Aoláin said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, social networks relied on users to flag objectionable content, all manner of hate speech, and calls to arms that, among other things, espoused violence. But as this content continued to fill up the fringes and spill into clear sight, pressure mounted on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and other popular social networks to automate the cleanup. They turned to machine learning, a powerful subset of artificial intelligence that can make sense of huge amounts of data with little to no oversight from human minders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/youtube-extremism-and-the-long-tail/555350/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: YouTube extremism and the long tail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed to identify and take down content posted by “extremists”—“extremists” as defined by software engineers—machine-learning software has become a potent catch-and-kill tool to keep the world’s largest social networks remarkably more sanitized places than they were just a year ago. Google and Facebook break out the numbers in their quarterly transparency reports. &lt;a href=&quot;https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;YouTube pulled&lt;/a&gt; 33 million videos off its network in 2018—roughly 90,000 a day. Of the videos removed after automated systems flagged them, 73 percent were removed so fast that no community members ever saw them. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;https://transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement#terrorist-propaganda&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;Facebook removed&lt;/a&gt; 15 million pieces of content it deemed “terrorist propaganda” from October 2017 to September 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, machines performed 99.5 percent of Facebook’s “terrorist content” takedowns. Just 0.5 percent of the purged material was reported by users first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those statistics are deeply troubling to open-source investigators, who complain that the machine-learning tools are black boxes. Few people, if any, in the human-rights world know how they’re programmed. Are these AI-powered vacuum cleaners able to discern that a video from Syria, Yemen, or Libya might be a valuable piece of evidence, something someone risked his or her life to post, and therefore worth preserving? YouTube, for one, says it’s working with human-rights experts to fine-tune its take-down procedures. But deeper discussions about the technology involved are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Companies are very loath to let civil society talk directly to engineers,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://witness.org/portfolio_page/dia-kayyali/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;Dia Kayyali&lt;/a&gt;, a technology-advocacy program manager at Witness, a human-rights organization that works with Khatib and the Syrian Archive. “It’s something that I’ve pushed for. A lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concerns are being drowned out by a counterargument, this one from governments, that tech companies should clamp down harder. Authoritarian countries routinely impose social-media blackouts during national crises, as Sri Lanka did after the Easter-morning terror bombings and as Venezuela did during the May 1 uprising. But politicians in healthy democracies are pressing social networks for round-the-clock controls in an effort to protect impressionable minds from violent content that could radicalize them. If these platforms fail to comply, they could face hefty fines and even jail time for their executives. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron intend to up the ante at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/christchurch-call-ardern-leads-push-against-online-terror-content&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;a summit next week&lt;/a&gt; calling on tech execs and world leaders to band together to eliminate the publication of extremist online content. After the March 15 mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, was streamed live on Facebook, countries including New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom passed or proposed comprehensive new online-terror laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2019-0193_EN.html?redirect&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;A proposed European Union law&lt;/a&gt; has been in the works for months. It would require technology companies to pull down harmful user-generated material—whether words or images—that “incites or solicits the commission or contribution of terrorist offenses, or promotes the participation in activities of a terrorist group.” That standard is extraordinarily broad. But if the companies don’t eliminate such posts within one hour, they face fines of up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274201/european-terrorist-content-regulation-extremist-terreg-upload-filter-one-hour-takedown-eu&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;4 percent of global revenues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/facebook-punish-censorship/577654/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;Conor Friedersdorf: The speech that Facebook plans to punish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;H&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;uman-rights advocates&lt;/span&gt; worry about the decisions tech giants and their algorithms will make under such outside pressure. “The danger is that governments will often get the balance wrong,” argued Ní Aoláin. “But actually we have the methods and means to challenge governments when they do so. But private entities? We don’t have the legal processes. These are private companies. And the legal basis upon which they regulate their relationships with their users, whether they’re in conflict zones or not, is determined by [the company’s] terms of service. It’s neither transparent nor fair. Your recourse is quite limited.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July, she wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Terrorism/OL_OTH_46_2018.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, finding fault with how Facebook defines terrorism-related content, a key determination in what it decides to flag and take down. From what Ní Aoláin can tell, “they just came up with a definition for terrorism that bears no relationship to the global definition agreed by states, which I think is a very dangerous precedent. I made that very clear in my communications with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked Facebook to comment on Ní Aoláin’s complaint, a company spokesperson &lt;a href=&quot;https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/12.11.18-Content-Standard-Forum-Minutes-.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;shared detailed minutes&lt;/a&gt; from a December content-standards forum. The minutes are a remarkable document, one that underscores the complexity of the judgments tech companies are being asked to make as they seek to monetize human interactions on a global scale. Is a terrorist organization one that “engages in premeditated acts of violence against persons or property,” or should the definition expand to include any non-state group that “engages in or advocates and lends substantial support” to “purposive and planned acts of violence”? “It would shock me,” one person at the meeting commented, “if in a year we don’t come back and say we need to refine this definition again.” (A company spokesperson said recently that there’s no update on the matter to announce.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the tech giants’ algorithms will implement these subtle standards is an open question. But a new crop of anti-terrorism bills, post-Christchurch, will thrust technology companies into an even more assertive enforcement role. Under the threat of massive fines, tech giants are likely to invest more in aggressive machine-learning content filters to suppress potentially objectionable material. All this will have a chilling effect on those who are trying to expose wrongdoing in war zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khatib, at the Syrian Archive, said the rise of machine-learning algorithms has made his job far more difficult in recent months. But the push for more filters continues. (As a Brussels-based digital-rights lobbyist in a separate conversation deadpanned, “Filters are the new black, essentially.”) The EU’s online-terrorism bill, Khatib noted, sends the message that sweeping unsavory content under the rug is okay; the social-media platforms will see to it that nobody sees it. He fears the unintended consequences of such a law—that in cracking down on content that’s deemed off-limits in the West, it could have ripple effects that make life even harder for those residing in repressive societies, or worse, in war zones. Any further crackdown on what people can share online, he said, “would definitely be a gift for all authoritarian regimes. It would be a gift for Assad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the ground in Syria,” he continued, “Assad is doing everything he can to make sure the physical evidence [of potential human-rights violations] is destroyed, and the digital evidence, too. The combination of all this—the filters, the machine-learning algorithms, and new laws—will make it harder for us to document what’s happening in closed societies.” That, he fears, is what dictators want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without you noticing (much), your computer is working hard in the background to organize its memory system. On top of its many tasks, a CPU must do something called “garbage collection,” whereby it identifies and deletes redundant or irrelevant data from applications to free up additional memory space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garbage collection is meant to spare programmers from having to manually address this unnecessary data, but the automated process that CPUs are tasked with consumes a lot of computational power—up to 10 percent or more of the total time a CPU spends on an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While completing his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~maas/&quot;&gt;Martin Maas&lt;/a&gt;, who now works at Google, designed a new type of device that relieves the CPU from its garbage collection duties. The design is described in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8695831&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published 23 April in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=40&quot;&gt;IEEE Micro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maas notes that CPUs, which have traditionally been assigned garbage collection, were never specifically designed for the task. “CPUs are built to be flexible and run a wide range of applications. As a result, they are relatively large and can take up a significant amount of power,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Maas and his colleagues created a compact accelerator unit that requires a small amount of chip area and power. It can be added to the CPU, similar to how many modern processor chips are integrated into graphics processing units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the software application is running on the CPU, this unit sits on the side and performs garbage collection for the application,” says Maas. “In principle, this means that you could build a system where the software does not have to worry about garbage collection at all and just keeps using the available memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the accelerator unit does its garbage collection in a more efficient manner than how CPUs have traditionally done it. For instance, CPUs have to complete some garbage collection actions in a certain order, whereas the new accelerator unit exploits the fact that these actions do not need to be done sequentially. By doing a larger number of memory operations simultaneously, it is more efficient at garbage collection than a CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Maas’s team compared the accelerator to a small CPU core, they found that their accelerator had 18 times better performance given each device’s respective sizes. In terms of power consumption, they estimate that the accelerator reduces the energy required for garbage collection by 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegating the task of garbage collection to an accelerator unit could enhance the productivity of computers. Maas points out that although the 10 percent of computation power that CPUs dedicate to garbage collection may not seem like a lot, globally this represents a large amount of computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also points out that many garbage collection mechanisms can result in unpredictable pauses, where the computer system stops for a brief moment to clean up its memory. “While you typically don’t notice it, this can be a problem in scenarios where you care about your system being very responsive, and programmers go out of their way to avoid these pauses, often at the cost of spending even more cycles on garbage collection,” he says. The new accelerator unit addresses both of these issues, paving the way for more efficient computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper, the researchers suggest that this new device could become a common component of future systems, bypassing the need for CPUs to be burdened by garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
