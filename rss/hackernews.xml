&lt;h4&gt;What does “Binding Arbitration” really mean?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;22.689538807649&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration is simply a method of resolving disputes that involves the two sides presenting their arguments to an arbitrator (usually a lawyer or retired judge) or panel of arbitrators. This arbitrator will ultimately decide who is right, who is wrong, and what to do about it. In effect, the arbitrator serves as judge and jury. This is usually done as a quick and quiet alternative to duking it out in court – which for large corporations can be a lengthy, costly, and newsworthy affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding arbitration (sometimes referred to as “forced arbitration”) essentially means that you give up your right to take someone to court as part of a lawsuit. Additionally, you give up your right to join forces with others in your situation and take a company to court in a class-action lawsuit. You can read more about Chase and forced arbitration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90357331/chase-adds-forced-arbitration-clause-to-slate-credit-cards&quot; aria-label=&quot;fast company article&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/business/jpmorgan-chase-credit-card-arbitration.html&quot; aria-label=&quot;new york times article&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkprogress.org/chase-just-tried-to-screw-its-credit-card-holders-heres-how-you-can-screw-them-back-530249232b32/&quot; aria-label=&quot;think progress article&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35.331753554502&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What do I need to do to opt-out?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to opt-out from Chase’s new forced arbitration clause, you must mail – that’s right – &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;mail a physical letter&lt;/span&gt; to their PO box by August 9, 2019 stating your rejection of the policy. In the letter you must include your name, account number, billing address, signature, and request to opt-out. We put together this tool to make all of that happen at the click of a button .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37.915649278579&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What are the pros and cons of opting-out?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro:&lt;/strong&gt; By opting-out, if Chase does something unethical or illegal (remember Wells Fargo?) to its customers, you can personally bring a class action in a public court and you secure the right to benefit from a class action brought by other Chase customers (as is the more common course of action for groups of consumers). Without opting-out, your only course of action will be to settle out of court through an arbitrator, which is commonly viewed as bad for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt; Opting-out will mandate that you would not be able to enter arbitration with Chase without their consent. If you take issue with a future policy or action taken by Chase, your only guaranteed course of action will be to take Chase to court in a lawsuit, which – when dealing with a large corporation – has the potential of being a more lengthy and costly process than arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34.211663066955&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How does this site work?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;16.18119266055&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you enter your information, sign the form, and click submit, your data is securely submitted to a PCI-compliant vault, printed, then mailed straight to Chase using &lt;a href=&quot;http://lob.com&quot; aria-label=&quot;LOB site&quot;&gt;Lob&lt;/a&gt;. We will not store your name, account number, or address and this data will never touch our servers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://verygoodsecurity.com&quot; aria-label=&quot;Very Good Security site&quot;&gt;Very Good Security&lt;/a&gt; will encrypt your account information and send us back a secure token – which is the only form of your account information stored on our end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;30.43119266055&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How much does using this site cost me?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing! We’ll cover the cost of printing and mailing your letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.242637644046&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So what’s the catch?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;11.936507936508&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think requiring a mailed letter in order to opt-out from a policy is bad for consumers and genuinely want to help. We don’t want any of your account information. We just ask that you give us your email address so we can send you a confirmation email and provide you a copy of your letter for your records. We will never sell or share your information with anyone without your explicit permission. If you give us permission to, we may send you an email sometime in the future to let you know about possible class actions against Chase (which you can now participate in!) and other related stuff that we’re building. Don’t worry though, we’ll make it super easy to unsubscribe if you aren’t interested. You can read our full privacy policy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chaseoptout.com/PrivacyPolicy.pdf&quot; aria-label=&quot;chase opt out form&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;39.125592417062&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;I’m not sure I feel comfortable giving you my account information…&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;23.828571428571&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s fine! You can certainly go through the opt-out process all by yourself, you stamp-haver, you. We put together a nice template that you can download &lt;a aria-label=&quot;show download modal&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; stating your rejection of the agreement. Just fill in your name, account number, and address – then print, sign, and mail the letter to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chase Customer Service&lt;br/&gt;P.O. Box 15298&lt;br/&gt;Wilmington, DE 19850-5298&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure the letter arrives no later than August 9, 2019. If you want to provide your email, we’ll send you a reminder to send out your letter before the 9th. That part isn’t mandatory though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37.381703470032&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the actual language in the agreement sent by Chase?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the email JP Morgan Chase sent customers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Can I (the customer) reject this agreement to arbitrate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. You have the right to reject this agreement to arbitrate if you notify us no later than 8/9/2019. You must do so in writing by stating that you reject this agreement to arbitrate and include your name, account number, address and personal signature. Your notice must be mailed to us at P.O. Box 15298, Wilmington, DE 19850-5298. Rejection notices sent to any other address, or sent by electronic mail or communicated orally, will not be accepted or effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;13.787878787879&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Where can I read more about this?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;28.175879396985&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Who are you and why did you build this?&lt;a class=&quot;openButton&quot;&gt;+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;closeButton&quot;&gt;-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pane&quot; readability=&quot;7.031847133758&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re a group of like-minded companies who like building things that help people. This idea was devised and built by the teams at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hmbradley.com&quot; aria-label=&quot;HM Bradley site&quot;&gt;HM Bradley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myradvocate.com&quot; aria-label=&quot;Radvocate site&quot;&gt;Radvocate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Matrix 1.0 and the Matrix.org Foundation</title>
<link>https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;matrix-10&quot;&gt;Matrix 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally &lt;strong&gt;exited beta&lt;/strong&gt;!! This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;FOSDEM 2019&lt;/a&gt; when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before you get too excited, it’s critical to understand that Matrix 1.0 is all about providing a &lt;strong&gt;stable, self-consistent, self-contained and secure version of the standard&lt;/strong&gt; which anyone should be able to use to independently implement production-grade Matrix clients, servers, bots and bridges etc. It does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mean that all planned or possible features in Matrix are now specified and implemented, but that the most important core of the protocol is a well-defined stable platform for everyone to build on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Synapse side, our focus has been exclusively on ensuring that Synapse correctly implements Matrix 1.0, to provide a stable and secure basis for participating in Matrix without risk of room corruption or other nastinesses. However, we have deliberately &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; focused on performance or features in the 1.0 release - so I’m afraid that synapse’s RAM footprint will not have got significantly better, and your favourite long-awaited features (automatically defragmenting rooms with lots of forward extremities, configurable message retention, admin management web-interface etc) have not yet landed. In other words, this is the opposite of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Riot 1.0 release&lt;/a&gt; (where the entire app was redesigned and radically improved its performance and UX) - instead, we have adopted the mantra to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;make it work, make it work right, and then (finally) make it fast&lt;/a&gt;. You can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released&quot;&gt;full release notes&lt;/a&gt; here. It’s also worth looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.0.0/CHANGES.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; through the Synapse 0.99 release series to see the massive amount of polishing that’s been going on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this means that the main headline features which land in Matrix 1.0 are vitally important but relatively dry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using X.509 certificates to trust servers rather than perspective notaries, to simplify and improve server-side trust. This is a &lt;strong&gt;breaking change&lt;/strong&gt; across Matrix, and we’ve given the community several months now to ensure their homeservers run a valid TLS certificate. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MSC1711&lt;/a&gt; for full details, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/24/final-countdown-to-1-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2 week warning&lt;/a&gt; we gave. As of ~9am UTC today, the matrix.org homeserver is running Synapse 1.0 and enforcing valid TLS certificates - the transition has begun (and so far we haven’t spotted any major breakage :). Thank you to everyone who &lt;a href=&quot;https://arewereadyyet.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;got ready&lt;/a&gt; in advance!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using .well-known URIs to discover servers, in case you can’t get a valid TLS certificate for your server’s domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v4.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;room version 4&lt;/a&gt; by default&lt;/strong&gt; for creating new rooms. This fixes the most important defects that the core room algorithm has historically encountered, particularly:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifying the ability to upgrade between room versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full specification of lazy loading room members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Short Authentication String&lt;/a&gt; (Emoji!) interactive verification of E2EE devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...and lots and lots and lots of bugfixes and spec omission fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of really exciting stuff in flight right now which sadly didn’t stabilise in time for Matrix 1.0, but will be landing as fast as we can finalise it now that 1.0 is at last out the door. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Editable messages! (These are in Synapse 1.0 and Riot already, but still stabilising so not enabled by default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reactions! (Similarly these are in develop)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threading!! (We’ve planted the seeds for this in the new ‘aggregations’ support which powers edits &amp;amp; reactions - but full thread support is still a bit further out).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/cross-signing2/proposals/1756-cross-signing.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cross-signed verification for end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt; (This is on a branch, but due to land any day now). We’ve also held off merging E2E backups into the Matrix 1.0 spec until cross-signing lands, given it may change the backup behaviour a bit. Once this is done, we can seriously talk about turning on E2E by default everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live-tracking of room statistics and state in Synapse! (This is in Synapse 1.0 already if you check out the new room_stats and room_state tables, but we need to provide a nice admin interface for it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for smaller footprint homeservers by reducing memory usage and stopping them from joining overly complex rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then stuff which we haven’t yet started, but is now unlocked by the 1.0 release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixing extremities build-up (and so massively improving performance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewriting Communities. Groups/Communities deliberately didn’t land in Matrix 1.0 as the current implementation has issues we want to fix first. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MSC1772&lt;/a&gt; has the details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewritten room directory using the new room stats/state tables to be super-speedy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super-speedy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;incremental state resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing MXIDs from events (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MSC1228&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to give a quick taster of the shape of things to come, here’s RiotX/Android, the all-new Riot client for Android, showing off Edits &amp;amp; Reactions in the wild…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/img/edits.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;...and here’s a screenshot of the final test jig for cross-signing devices in end-to-end encryption, so you will never have to manually verify new devices for a trusted user ever again! We demoed a *very* early version of this at FOSDEM, but this here is the testing harness for real deal, after several iterations of the spec and implementation to nail down the model. + means the device/user's cross-signing key is trusted, T means it's TOFU:&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/img/cross-signing.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;So, there you have it - welcome to Matrix 1.0, and we look forward to our backlog of feature work now landing!
&lt;p&gt;Massive massive thanks to everyone who has stuck with the project over the years and helped support and grow Matrix - little did we think back in May 2014 that it’d take us this long to exit beta, but hopefully you’ll agree that it’s been worth it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking of which, we were looking through the photos we took from the first ever session hacking on Matrix back in May 2014…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/img/nightmare.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Whiteboard 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...suffice it to say that of the architectural options, we went with #3 in the end...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/img/pl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Whiteboard 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and that nowadays we actually know how power levels work, in excruciating and (hopefully) well-specified detail :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been an absolutely enormous amount of work to pull Matrix 1.0 together - both on the spec side (thanks to the Spec Core Team for corralling proposals, and everyone who's contributed proposals, and particularly to Travis for editing it all) and the implementation side (thanks to the whole Synapse team for the tedious task of cleaning up everything that was needed for 1.0). And of course, huge thanks go to everyone who has been helping test and debug the Synapse 1.0 release candidates, or just supporting the project to get to this point :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-matrixorg-foundation&quot;&gt;The Matrix.org Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as promised, alongside Matrix 1.0, we are very happy to announce the official launch of the finalised Matrix.org Foundation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a long-running project to ensure that Matrix’s future is governed by a neutral non-profit custodian for the benefit of everyone in the Matrix ecosystem. We started the process nearly a year ago back with the initial proposal &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Towards Open Governance of Matrix.org&lt;/a&gt;, and then legally &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;incorporated the Foundation&lt;/a&gt; in October, and published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;final governance proposal&lt;/a&gt; in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today the Foundation is finalised and operational, and all the assets for Matrix.org have been transferred from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vector.im&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;New Vector&lt;/a&gt; (the startup we formed in 2017 to hire the core Matrix team). In fact you may already have seen Matrix.org Foundation notices popping up all over the Matrix codebase (as all of New Vector’s work on the public Matrix codebase for the forseeable is being assigned to the Matrix.org Foundation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we’re excited to introduce the &lt;strong&gt;Guardians of the Matrix.org Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. The Guardians are the legal directors of the non-profit Foundation, and are responsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core Team) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix. Guardians are typically independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem and may even not be members of today’s Matrix community, but are deeply aligned with the mission of the project. Guardians are selected to be respected and trusted by the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the Foundation and keep the other Guardians honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have started the Foundation with five Guardians - two being the original founders of the Matrix project (Matthew and Amandine) and three being entirely independent, thus ensuring the original Matrix team forms a minority which can be kept in check by the rest of the Guardians. The new Guardians are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Jon Crowcroft - Marconi Professor of Communications Systems in the Computer Lab at the University of Cambridge and the Turing Institute. Jon is a pioneer in the field of decentralised communication, and a fellow of the Royal Society, the ACM, the British Computer Society, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon is a global expert in decentralisation and data privacy, and is excellently placed to help ensure Matrix stays true to its ideals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jutta Steiner - As co-founder and CEO of Parity Technologies, Jutta is dedicated to building a better internet - Web 3.0 - where users’ privacy &amp;amp; control come first. Parity Technologies is a leader in the blockchain space – known to many as the creator of one of the most popular Ethereum clients, it is also the creator of two ambitious new blockchain technlogies, Polkadot and Substrate, that make it easier to experiment and innovate on scalability, encryption and governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parity has been pioneering Matrix enterprise use since the moment they decided to rely on Matrix for their internal and external communication back in 2016, and now run their own high-volume deployment, with end-to-end encryption enabled by default. Jutta represents organisations who are professionally dependent on Matrix day-to-day, as well as bringing her unique experiences around decentralisation and ensuring that Web 3.0 will be a fair web for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d like to offer a very warm welcome to the new Guardians, and thank them profusely for giving up their time to join the Foundation and help ensure Matrix stays on course for the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the full update on the Foundation, please check out the new website content at &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/foundation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://matrix.org/foundation&lt;/a&gt; which should tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the Foundation, the Guardians, the Foundation’s legal Articles of Association, and the day-to-day Rules which define the Open Governance process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-finally&quot;&gt;And finally…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix 1.0 has been a bit of an epic to release, but puts us on a much stronger footing for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s very unlikely that we’d have made it this far if most of the core dev team wasn’t able to work on Matrix as their day job. Right now we are actively looking for large-scale donations to the Matrix.org Foundation (and/or investment in &lt;a href=&quot;https://vector.im&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;New Vector&lt;/a&gt;) to ensure that the team can maintain as tight a focus on core Matrix work as possible, and to ensure the project realises its full potential. While Matrix is growing faster than ever, this perversely means we have more and more distractions - whether that’s keeping the Matrix.org server safe and operational, or handling support requests from the community, or helping new members of the ecosystem get up and running. If you would like Matrix to succeed, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a3c2f343e33343d1a373b2e2833227435283d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to sponsor work, prioritise features, get support contracts, or otherwise support the project. We’re particularly interested in sponsorship around decentralised reputation work (e.g. publishing a global room directory which users can filter based on their preferences).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, huge thanks to everyone who has continued to support us through thick and thin on &lt;a href=&quot;https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Liberapay&lt;/a&gt; or other platforms. Every little helps here, both in terms of practically keeping the lights on, and also inspiring larger donations &amp;amp; financial support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: thank you once again for flying Matrix. We hope you enjoy 1.0, and we look forward to everything else landing on the horizon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Matthew, Amandine &amp;amp; the whole Matrix.org Team.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>RAMBleed Attack – Reading Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them</title>
<link>https://rambleed.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://rambleed.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;34.953819444444&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAMBleed is a side-channel attack that enables an attacker to read out physical memory belonging to other processes. The implications of violating arbitrary privilege boundaries are numerous, and vary in severity based on the other software running on the target machine. As an example, in our paper we demonstrate an attack against OpenSSH in which we use RAMBleed to leak a 2048 bit RSA key. However, RAMBleed can be used for reading other data as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAMBleed is based on a previous side channel called Rowhammer, which enables an attacker to flip bits in the memory space of other processes. We show in our paper that an attacker, by observing Rowhammer-induced bit flips in her own memory, can deduce the values in nearby DRAM rows. Thus, RAMBleed shifts Rowhammer from being a threat not only to integrity, but confidentiality as well. Furthermore, unlike Rowhammer, RAMBleed does not require persistent bit flips, and is thus effective against ECC memory commonly used by server computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will present our paper titled &quot;RAMBleed: Reading Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them&quot; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2020/&quot;&gt;41st IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy&lt;/a&gt; in May, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;9.1935483870968&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Rowhammer bug?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;The trend towards increasing DRAM cell density and decreasing capacitor size over the past decades has given rise to a reliability issue known as Rowhammer. Specifically, repeated accesses to rows in DRAM can lead to bit flips in neighboring rows (not only the direct neighbors), even if these neighboring rows are not accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Attackers can exploit these cross process bit flips for a myriad of security breaches. Researchers have demonstrated how to abuse Rowhammer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html&quot;&gt;privilege escalation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vusec.net/projects/flip-feng-shui/&quot;&gt;RSA modulus factorization&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is RAMBleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Previous attacks exploited the Rowhammer effect to write (or flip) bits in the victim's memory. RAMBleed is different in that it uses Rowhammer for reading data stored inside the computer's physical memory. As the physical memory is shared among all process in the system, this puts all processes at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What data can be read by RAMBleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;While the end-to-end attack we demonstrated read out OpenSSH 7.9's RSA key, RAMBleed can potentially read any data stored in memory. In practice, what can be read depends on the victim program's memory access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You extracted an OpenSSH key!? Does that mean that I should stop using SSH?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;There is nothing particularly vulnerable about OpenSSH, it was simply a convenient target to demonstrate RAMBleed's security implications. We don't recommend that you stop using SSH any more than we recommend that you stop using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.8087431693989&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What technologies are affected by RAMBleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;RAMBleed relies on Rowhammer-induced bit flips to read privileged memory. As such, any system that uses Rowhammer-susceptible DIMMs is vulnerable. Previous research has demonstrated bit flips on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html&quot;&gt;DDR3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thirdio.com/rowhammer.pdf&quot;&gt;DDR4&lt;/a&gt; with TRR (targeted row refresh) enabled. While we demonstrated our attack on a desktop machine and an ECC enabled server machine, Rowhammer attacks have been demonstrated against both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vusec.net/projects/drammer/&quot;&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; devices and &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html&quot;&gt;laptops&lt;/a&gt;. As such, we suspect that many classes of computers are susceptible to RAMBleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14.730077120823&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does ECC (Error Correcting Code) memory prevent RAMBleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;No! RAMBleed uses bit flips as a &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; side channel, and as such does not require bit flips to be persistent. Instead, the attacker merely needs to know that a bit flip occurred; the secret information leaks regardless of whether or not ECC corrects the flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;If ECC corrects the flip, how can the attacker determine whether or not a bit has flipped in her memory? The attacker can read her memory and use the ECC timing side channel to determine if the bit flipped. As described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vusec.net/projects/eccploit/&quot;&gt;Cocojar et al.&lt;/a&gt;, when the hardware corrects the bit flip, a large delay is induced on that particular memory access. On our setup, we found an even stronger signal than previously reported, with a 1,000,000 X slowdown over the common case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I mitigate this issue?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Users can mitigate their risk by upgrading their memory to DDR4 with targeted row refresh (TRR) enabled. While Rowhammer-induced bit flips have been demonstrated on TRR, it is harder to accomplish in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Memory manufacturers can help mitigate this issue by more rigorously testing for faulty DIMMs. Furthermore, publicly documenting vendor specific TRR implementations will facilitate a stronger development process as security researchers probe such implementations for weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can RAMBleed be detected by antivirus?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;We believe that it is very unlikely that any antivirus software on the market currently detects RAMBleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was RAMBleed ever exploited in the wild?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;It is not possible for us to say definitively, but we believe it to be unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does RAMBleed work?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Rowhammer induced bit flips are data dependent, i.e. a bit is more likely to flip when the bits above and below it have the opposite charge. This creates a data-dependent side channel, wherein an attacker can deduce the values of bits in nearby rows by observing bit flips in her own memory rows. Finally, as the data in nearby rows might belong to a different process, this leakage breaks the isolation boundaries enforced by the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;To exploit this effect, we developed novel memory massaging techniques to carefully place the victim's secret data in the rows above and below the attacker's memory row. This causes the bit flips in the attacker's rows to depend on the values of the victim's secret data. The attacker can then use Rowhammer to induce bit flips in her own memory, thereby leaking the victim's secret data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a CVE number?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Yes, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0174&quot;&gt;CVE-2019-0174&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it called RAMBleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;Due to deficiencies in the memory modules, the RAM bleeds its contents, which we then recover through a side-channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.84761904761905&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I use the logo?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;All rights to the logo have been waived through &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~minkin/index.html&quot;&gt;Marina Minkin&lt;/a&gt; designed the logo.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://desktopneo.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tags&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flexible organization for everything.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;maintext&quot;&gt;Children growing up now are using hashtags and Google long before files and folders. We know how to enter something into a searchbar and get relevant results. Even our brain works through association, not hierachy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neo uses tags instead of folders to make finding all your content more flexible and efficient. You can tag everything from documents and apps to mails, websites, tweets, people or events. Tags could even expand to specific content on the web, like videos on YouTube or products on Amazon. So instead of your stuff spreading across many different apps and services, you can get all related content in one place. The location of content becomes irrelevant, making sharing across devices and users much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags are very flexible. You can add multiple tags, and you don’t have to define a specific location or a single hierachy. Of course, you can also edit tags later on. But you don’t need to use tags for everything. You can still use search, filters and document pickers from apps to get to your content. Tagging is a pro feature that can extend and coexist with more basic means of file management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tags in Neo are styled as hashtags (like &lt;em&gt;#tag&lt;/em&gt;). Hashtags brought tagging to a mainstream audience and are instantly recognizable. They are also very quick to add, without switching to a specific tagging mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s wrong with folders?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folders were a great metaphor when our files were a handful of office documents. But today, complex hierachies make it hard to organize and find what we are looking for. The concept of a file being located in a single place seems outdated. Content is stored, synced, backed up and shared among many different devices. And our most important content lives in services or apps, not in folders and files. While mobile devices are trying to kill file management completely, it’s more important today than ever. With the enormous amount and complexity of content, we need a new solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Support for U2F security keys</title>
<link>https://blog.1password.com/introducing-support-for-u2f-security-keys/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.1password.com/introducing-support-for-u2f-security-keys/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;introduction&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;You can now use U2F-compatible security keys as a second factor for your 1Password account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.1password.com/multi-factor-authentication-in-1password/&quot;&gt;added two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; to provide another layer of protection for your 1Password account. When this is enabled, you are prompted to enter your second factor any time you sign in from a new device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, that second factor was a time-based one-time password generated by an authenticator app on your phone. Today, I’m happy to announce a new option: we now offer support for Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)-compatible security keys. This is done via the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/webauthn&quot;&gt;WebAuthn API&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re excited to be among the first services to adopt this new browser standard. WebAuthn is backwards-compatible with U2F, so all certified U2F security keys will work with our WebAuthn-enabled flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/u2f/chrome-security-key-prompt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Security key prompt in Chrome&quot; title=&quot;Security key prompt in Chrome&quot; width=&quot;1165.05px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-security-key&quot;&gt;What is a security key?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security keys are small physical devices that can be used as a second factor. Support is built into most web browsers and works with many online services like Google and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“WebAuthn brings to life the concept of using an external security key across multiple devices and platforms, with no shared secrets among services. It’s exciting to see 1Password implement WebAuthn support to enable YubiKey hardware-backed authentication for their users.” — &lt;em&gt;Derek Hanson, VP Solutions Architecture and Alliances at Yubico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re prompted for your second factor, just tap a button on your security key and you’re in. No need to find your phone, open the authenticator app, and type out the six-digit code while trying to race the countdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-your-key-with-1password&quot;&gt;Using your key with 1Password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security keys are currently supported on 1Password.com in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge. (It’s coming to Safari 13 this fall.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while it works great as your second factor in those browsers, for now you’ll still need an authenticator app set up to use with the 1Password desktop and mobile apps (and any unsupported browsers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add your security keys now by heading over to the 1Password web app and visiting our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://start.1password.com/profile/2fa&quot;&gt;Two-Factor Authentication page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.1password.com/posts/2019/u2f/manage-2fa-page.png&quot; alt=&quot;Two-Factor Authentication page in 1Password web app&quot; title=&quot;Two-Factor Authentication page in 1Password web app&quot; width=&quot;1146.05px&quot; class=&quot;round shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Master Password, which is used for the encryption of your data, still remains the most important thing protecting your 1Password account. Adding a second factor does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean you can get away with a weaker Master Password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to-buy-a-security-key&quot;&gt;Where to buy a security key&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in getting a security key, you can buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/store/&quot;&gt;YubiKey&lt;/a&gt; from the Yubico Store, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Feitian-ePass-NFC-FIDO-Security/dp/B01M1R5LRD/&quot;&gt;Feitian&lt;/a&gt; keys from Amazon, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key_kit&quot;&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; keys from the Google Store. Any device that supports the U2F standard will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works-under-the-hood&quot;&gt;How it works under the hood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebAuthn is a pretty neat implementation based on public key crypto, and resolves security vulnerabilities like phishing. Our server generates a random token and asks your browser to get it cryptographically signed by your security key. The browser also includes the current domain (and some other data) as part of the payload that is signed. This signed response gets sent back to our server, which will decode it; make sure the token, domain, and other data match what we expect; and finally verify the signature using the device’s public key.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley startup Pilot AI Labs Inc. signed a Chinese-backed venture-capital firm as its first big investor in 2015. By last summer, Pilot AI wanted it gone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. startup hoped to sell more of its artificial-intelligence software to the U.S. government after working with the Pentagon, according to people familiar with its operations, and worried its effort could be hurt by the investor’s ties to China’s government. The chairman of the Chinese-backed investor, Digital Horizon Capital, was asked to sell back its stake,...

<title>No Kings: How Do You Make Good Decisions Efficiently in a Flat Organization?</title>
<link>https://doist.com/blog/decision-making-flat-organization/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://doist.com/blog/decision-making-flat-organization/</guid>
<description>Illustration by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WeihungYin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Yin Weihung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article started out as an internal conversation on a thread around how our team could learn to ask and give feedback more mindfully. It explores how we can balance making decisions quickly while maintaining our openness to feedback to ensure our decisions are good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://doist.com/?utm_source=doist_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=decisionmaking_flat_organizations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Doist&lt;/a&gt; we believe that open and sincere communication improves our decision-making process. That’s why we’ve built a culture that encourages feedback at all levels of decision-making: from purely technical solutions to team and product management. We built our team communication app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twist.com/?utm_source=doist_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=decisionmaking_flat_organizations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twist&lt;/a&gt;, around public threads to make that level of transparency and engagement possible for both ourselves and other remote workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, we thought that the more input you get, the better your decisions will be. (This idea aligns quite naturally with the engineering ethos that more data means better decisions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as our team has grown, we’ve learned that too much of a good thing is not a good thing. I once witnessed one of our designers ask the team for feedback on a draft of the Twist logo. All of a sudden everybody turned into font and logo experts (I was guilty as well) and overwhelmed him with feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;db-article__quote-featured&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, we thought that the more input you get, the better your decisions will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the leader of Doist’s back-end team, I saw this kind of feedback overload as a big challenge to our team’s ability to operate efficiently. There were too many inputs. And more and more time was spent responding to feedback rather than executing on decisions. That’s when I came across a document detailing the principles of “rough consensus”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force&lt;/a&gt; (IETF) is a membership-based organization of designers, operators, vendors, and researchers that develop the standards that have shaped the internet into the tool we use today. Their main decision-making principle was coined by Dave Clark in 1992:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reject: kings, presidents, and voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in: rough consensus and running code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been curious about what “rough consensus” means. How do you actually know when you reach one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;db-article__quote-featured&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a group of people make the best decision without “kings” in situations where there’s no obvious right answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there is a document that explains in detail the process and the ideology behind the IETF’s approach to decision-making called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;RFC 7282. On Consensus and Humming in the IETF&lt;/a&gt;.” It provides very practical guidelines on how to advance technical discussions to converge around a solution without unnecessary delay. This document can be helpful to all of us, especially product leadership and squad leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IETF faces the same challenges all technology teams do as they shape the product and specify the behavior of its components. As the document puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engineering always involves a set of tradeoffs. It is almost certain that any time engineering choices need to be made, there will be options that appeal to some people, but are not appealing to some others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question becomes: how does a group of people make the best decision without “kings” in situations where there’s no obvious right answer? A shared understanding around how decisions are made is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IETF, they sometimes hum instead of raising their hands when they need to vote. The idea is to make voting more anonymous and also fight the temptation to make decisions based solely on the number of votes. As emphasized in the document, humming gives the person deciding the opportunity to “take the temperature of the room”. It’s just one tool they use to move the discussion forward, rather than end it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this approach can’t be replicated exactly on a remote team for obvious reasons, it does illustrate some of the main principles behind rough consensus and what distinguishes it from top-down decision-making on the one hand and majority-rule decision-making on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rough consensus relies on the distinction between two types of objections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Not the best choice” feedback: “I don’t believe Solution A is the best choice, because XYZ. I believe Solution B would be better, but I accept that Solution A can work too.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental flaws: “I believe Solution A is unacceptable because XYZ.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rough consensus isn’t majority rule. It’s okay to go ahead with a solution that may not look like the best choice for everyone or even the majority. “Not the best choice” means that you believe there is a better way to solve the problem, but you accept that this one will work too. That type of feedback should be welcomed, but it shouldn’t be allowed to slow down a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;db-article__quote-featured&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone can live with a given solution, you’ve reached rough consensus, even if there are outstanding objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s crucial to address and discuss all fundamental flaws before the discussion is done. Fundamental flaws are critical issues that should disqualify a proposed solution. It’s hard to define what qualifies as a fundamental flaw, but a few starting points are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will substantially increase the technical debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t scale well (unless the specific circumstance does not require scalability).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires too much work to implement, and it doesn’t justify the value which the solution adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list is not complete, and other teams will of course define a fundamental flaw differently. For example, based on our values of respecting users’ time, attention, and intentions, the product design team may consider any solution that unnecessarily distracts the user to be fundamentally flawed. Based on our company’s priority to remain an independent and sustainable company, the marketing team may consider any solution that costs more than the revenue it will bring in to be fundamentally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for an organization to have a shared understanding of what “fundamentally flawed” means going into a discussion of proposed solutions, even if the definition evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you ensure that fundamental flaws are fully addressed without stifling or getting slowed down by non-critical feedback? Here’s how the IETF recommends moving toward rough consensus when a discussion has stalled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chair who asks, “Is everyone OK with choice A?” is going to get objections. But a chair who asks, “Can anyone not live with choice A?” is more likely to only hear from folks who think that choice A is impossible to engineer given some constraints. The objector might convince the rest of the group that the objections are valid and the working group might choose a different path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, an objector can’t simply say “I don’t like solution A” or even object by providing an alternative that they believe is better — they have to first prove why solution A has fundamental flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone can live with a given solution, you’ve reached rough consensus, even if there are outstanding objections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substantial part of the IETF document is dedicated to the question of compromises, distinguishing between two types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the word “compromise” gets used in two different ways […] Engineering always involves balancing tradeoffs […]: We might have to compromise processor speed for lower power consumption, or compromise throughput for congestion resistance. Those sorts of compromises are among engineering choices, and they are expected and essential. […].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is another sense of “compromise” that involves compromising between people, not engineering principles. For example, a minority of a group might object to a particular proposal, and even after discussion still think the proposal is deeply problematic, but decide that they don’t have the energy to argue against it and say, “Forget it, do what you want”. That surely can be called a compromise […] but really all that they’ve done is capitulated. That’s not coming to consensus; there still exists an outstanding unaddressed objection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, if the objection is only that the choice is not ideal but is otherwise acceptable, such a compromise is fine. But conceding when there is a real outstanding technical objection is not coming to consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there’s a temptation to jump into a Twist thread and add a quick “two cents” to an ongoing discussion. Chances are, those two cents will be either truisms that probably aren’t worth sharing in the first place or opinions which require further explanation to fully justify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;db-article__quote-featured&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s not worth spending the time to over-communicate your point, the feedback is probably not worth slowing down the discussion for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter case, the decision-maker will likely either ignore your feedback since they don’t fully understand it or have to follow up with you to get to the root of your objections. Do what you can to provide them with the information they need to evaluate your argument up front. If you believe your feedback to be critical, say so and spend the extra time explaining and defending your position from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially important in the context of remote teams. Here we lack the luxury of quick back and forth communications to clarify the point, and a person’s two cents can seriously slow down the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s not worth spending the time to over-communicate your point, the feedback is probably not worth slowing down the discussion for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rough consensus approach contrasts with the “if it’s not a ‘hell yeah’, it’s a no” criterium we’ve adopted for hiring (i.e., reject a candidate unless everyone is in enthusiastic agreement). However, I believe a lower decision-making standard is acceptable, and even necessary, for most of the technical and product-related challenges we face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may use the “hell yeah” principle for hiring and some other decisions, but we use the quick iteration principle when we ship things. We don’t aim for perfection the first time — we build fast, we ship, we learn, we iterate, and we ship again. Step by step, we get to where we want to be. If we applied a standard of perfection and complete consensus to the things we shipped, we’d quickly become sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;db-article__quote-featured&quot; readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We risk more when we delay decisions in an attempt to reach total consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our “hell yeah” approach to hiring, we can trust the competence and diligence of the person making the decision. Yes, with rough consensus we risk not making the best choice, but if the decider believes it’s the best solution, we can trust it to be adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it turns out to not be the best decision, in the end, the increased speed at which we’re able to operate will, on average, compensate for the setbacks. We risk more when we delay decisions in an attempt to reach total consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough consensus doesn’t mean that we don’t aim for perfection in the actual implementation of the solution. When implementing, we should always aim for technical excellence. Commitment to the implementation is often what makes a solution the right one. (This is similar to Amazon’s “disagree and commitment” philosophy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IETF case is a good example of how organizations with different structures and cultures solve the universal problem of decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not proposing we apply rough consensus to all of our decisions. We are not the IETF — our goals and structure are quite different. However, I believe there are valuable lessons we can draw from their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;db-article__quote-featured&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a good enough solution X, don’t ask people what they think about it. Instead, ask everyone if they can live with it and if not, why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to maintain a relatively flat, transparent, and inclusive organization. As a result, consensus-based decision-making comes more naturally to us than top-down decision-making. How do we harness the benefits of collective input while making decisions quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough consensus is a good standard for ensuring that minor remarks or non-critical issues don’t impede our performance, and it’s an effective tool in our belt as more and more voices are added to the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some concrete takeaways we can all apply for more efficient and effective decision-making:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the one raising objections to a solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before you object, weigh whether or not your objection reveals a serious issue. It’s okay to make a remark like “I believe there is a better decision and it’s this, but I’m also okay with the current choice.” It’s also okay to suggest improvements to the idea (or the implementation, if you’re discussing a pull request for example) without vetoing the current choice. Make clear what type of objection you’re raising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe the choice has a blocking flaw, try to make your feedback as clear as possible so that the decision-maker can address it properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe the choice has a blocking flaw, try to find enough time and energy to convince opponents. When you differentiate between non-critical feedback and a fundamental flaw and prioritize the latter, you’re able to conserve the time and mental energy for the most important discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re the one deciding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be vigilant and make sure the discussion doesn’t stall on non-critical, “not the best solution” feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a discussion which cannot converge, ask participants to clarify if objections to a proposal address fundamental flaws or remarks which should be taken in consideration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a good enough solution X, don’t ask people what they think about it. Instead, ask everyone if they can live with it and if not, why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t feel like you have to default to majority rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final quote from the IETF document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t try to reach consensus in the IETF as an end in itself. We use consensus-building as a tool to get to the best technical (and sometimes procedural) outcome when we make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Doist we strive to create a culture where everyone’s feedback is heard. We believe we’re a stronger company for it. But as we’ve learned, this requires effort and self-awareness from all parties to the discussion. We’re not there yet, but the principles of rough consensus can be useful in balancing feedback and efficiency in all of our decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Canada to ban keeping whales, dolphins in captivity</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/whales-1.5169138</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;
Bill S-203 passed a third reading Monday in the House of Commons. (Scott Dunlop/The Canadian Press)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;140.61785375119&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal welfare advocates are celebrating after the House of Commons voted Monday to ban keeping whales, dolphins and porpoises in captivity — in a move with long-term consequences for Canadian marine parks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bill S-203, known as the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act, passed a third reading in the House of Commons Monday, more than three years after it was introduced in December 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=e&amp;amp;Mode=1&amp;amp;billId=8063284&amp;amp;View=5&quot;&gt;The bill&lt;/a&gt; bans keeping and breeding cetaceans — including whales, dolphins and porpoises — through amendments to the Criminal Code, and would levy fines to lawbreakers of up to $200,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whales and dolphins that are already in captivity will be grandfathered in by the bill, meaning parks can keep all the animals they currently own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bill also restricts importing and exporting these animals, and bans making them perform for entertainment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The move aligns Canada with a growing list of countries that are endeavouring to ban cetaceans in captivity, said Rebecca Aldworth, executive director of the Canadian chapter of Humane Society International.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is &quot;a victory for all Canadians who want this to be a more humane country,&quot; said Aldworth, whose organization was among a coalition of marine scientists and organizations backing the bill. Advocates had long argued that keeping these highly intelligent creatures in tanks is cruel. This is disputed by some marine park operators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impact on Marineland &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monday's vote notably impacts Marineland, the Niagara Falls amusement park and zoo that is considered the last Canadian park committed to keeping cetaceans in captivity. Marineland owns about 61 of these animals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-whale-dolphin-captivity-ban-1.5082664&quot;&gt;according to previously reported data&lt;/a&gt; — 55 beluga whales, five bottlenose dolphins and one orca, or &quot;killer whale.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Vancouver Aquarium has just one dolphin left, advocacy groups say, but in January announced it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-aquarium-will-no-longer-keep-whales-dolphins-in-captivity-1.4492316&quot;&gt;would no longer hold whales and dolphins in captivity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4720167.1560209937!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/marineland-ospca-lawsuit-20180105.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Marineland, in Niagara Falls, argued that that Bill S-203 indicates that its actions do not amount to animal cruelty. (Tara Walton/The Canadian Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marineland had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-whale-dolphin-captivity-canada-senate-bill-1.4876136&quot;&gt;strongly opposed to the bill,&lt;/a&gt; previously saying it would devastate attendance and threaten conservation efforts at parks where these animals are on display. The park has also said the bill jeopardizes seasonal employment for hundreds of local residents during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Murray Sinclair, the former judge who helped usher the bill through Parliament, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-whale-dolphin-captivity-ban-1.5082664&quot;&gt;previously said that&lt;/a&gt; Marineland has enough beluga whales already to likely continue for another 30 years, &quot;so no jobs are going to be lost as a result of this in the immediate future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the grandfathering, Phil Demers, a former Marineland trainer-turned activist, called it a &quot;historic day for Canada.&quot; Demers has spoken out about his time at Marineland, and says keeping mammals in captivity is abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is validation for all the concerns that ... former Marineland employees and activists alike have been stressing for many decades,&quot; said Demers, who has been involved with Bill S-203 since the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marineland 'confident' it remains compliant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement Monday, Marineland Canada said it complies with &quot;all aspects&quot; of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bill S-203 does not impair the operations of Marineland. Marineland will continue to provide world-class care to all of its animals,&quot; the park said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marineland said the bill indicates that cetaceans living in the park do &quot;not amount to animal cruelty, despite the allegations of uninformed, professional activists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill exempts the whales currently at Marineland and it &quot;recognizes the educational role of Marineland by prohibiting entertainment only shows while continuing to permit Marineland's Educational Presentations,&quot; the park said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said Marineland is misinterpreting the legislation, which &quot;very clearly&quot; says that keeping cetaceans in captivity is animal cruelty. May, along with other advocates, hopes that whales currently living in captivity can eventually move to sanctuaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;A two-month-old beluga whale calf swims with her mother, Qila, at the Vancouver Aquarium in Vancouver, B.C., in 2008. The aquarium said in January that it will stop its practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity.  (Darryl Dick/The Canadian Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May sponsored Bill S-203, which was was first introduced by now-retired Liberal Sen. Wilfred Moore in December 2015. The bill cleared the Senate last October — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-whale-dolphin-captivity-canada-senate-bill-1.4876136&quot;&gt;where it faced resistance from some Conservative senators&lt;/a&gt; — after nearly three years of debate and study. It passed the Commons fisheries committee in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bill would never have passed without thousands of Canadians' support, said May, with many people writing letters and emails. She called the bill a &quot;non-partisan&quot; effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill has exceptions: cetaceans can be kept in captivity if they're receiving care or rehabilitation after an injury, or for scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S-203 also puts restrictions on possessing reproductive materials, including cetacean sperm or an embryo.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fertilizer plants emit 100 times more methane than reported</title>
<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190606183254.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190606183254.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Emissions of methane from the industrial sector have been vastly underestimated, researchers from Cornell University and Environmental Defense Fund have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;text&quot; readability=&quot;94&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a Google Street View car equipped with a high-precision methane sensor, the researchers discovered that methane emissions from ammonia fertilizer plants were 100 times higher than the fertilizer industry's self-reported estimate. They also were substantially higher than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimate for all industrial processes in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We took one small industry that most people have never heard of and found that its methane emissions were three times higher than the EPA assumed was emitted by all industrial production in the United States,&quot; said John Albertson, co-author and professor of civil and environmental engineering. &quot;It shows us that there's a huge gap between a priori estimates and real-world measurements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers' findings are reported in &quot;Estimation of Methane Emissions From the U.S. Ammonia Fertilizer Industry Using a Mobile Sensing Approach,&quot; published in &lt;em&gt;Elementa&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of natural gas has grown in recent years, bolstered by improved efficiency in shale gas extraction and the perception that natural gas is a less dirty fossil fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But natural gas is largely methane, which molecule-per-molecule has a stronger global warming potential than carbon dioxide,&quot; Albertson said. &quot;The presence of substantial emissions or leaks anywhere along the supply chain could make natural gas a more significant contributor to climate change than previously thought.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate methane emissions from downstream industrial sources, the researchers focused on the fertilizer industry, which uses natural gas both as the fuel and one of the main ingredients for ammonia and urea products. Ammonia fertilizer is produced at only a couple dozen plants in the U.S.; factories are often located near public roadways, where emissions carried downwind can be detected -- in this case by mobile sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, the Google Street View vehicle traveled public roads near six representative fertilizer plants in the country's midsection to quantify &quot;fugitive methane emissions&quot; -- defined as inadvertent losses of methane to the atmosphere, likely due to incomplete chemical reactions during fertilizer production, incomplete fuel combustion or leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that, on average, 0.34 percent of the gas used in the plants is emitted to the atmosphere. Scaling this emission rate from the six plants to the entire industry suggests total annual methane emissions of 28 gigagrams -- 100 times higher than the fertilizer industry's self-reported estimate of 0.2 gigagrams per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, this figure far exceeds the EPA's estimate that all industrial processes in the United States produce only 8 gigagrams of methane emissions per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even though a small percentage is being leaked, the fact that methane is such a powerful greenhouse gas makes the small leaks very important,&quot; said Joseph Rudek, co-author and lead senior scientist at Environmental Defense Fund. &quot;In a 20-year timeframe, methane's global warming potential is 84 times that of carbon dioxide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Project Svalbard: The Future of Have I Been Pwned</title>
<link>https://www.troyhunt.com/project-svalbard-the-future-of-have-i-been-pwned/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/project-svalbard-the-future-of-have-i-been-pwned/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2013, I was beginning to get the sense that data breaches were becoming a big thing. The prevalence of them seemed to be really ramping up as was the impact they were having on those of us that found ourselves in them, myself included. Increasingly, I was writing about what I thought was a pretty fascinating segment of the infosec industry; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/why-your-apps-security-design-could/&quot;&gt;password reuse across Gawker and Twitter resulting in a breach of the former sending Acai berry spam via the latter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/brief-sony-password-analysis/&quot;&gt;Sony Pictures passwords being, well, precisely the kind of terrible passwords we expect people to use&lt;/a&gt; but hey, actually seeing them for yourself is still shocking. And while I'm on Sony, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/what-do-sony-and-yahoo-have-in-common/&quot;&gt;the prevalence with which their users applied the same password to their Yahoo! accounts&lt;/a&gt; (59% of common email addresses had exactly the same password).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around this time the Adobe data breach happened and that got me &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interested in this segment of the industry, not least because I was in there. Twice. Most significantly though, it contained 153M other people which was a massive incident, even by today’s standards. All of these things combined – the prevalence of breaches, the analysis I was doing and the scale of Adobe – got me thinking: I wonder how many people know? Do they realise they were breached? Do they realise &lt;em&gt;how many times&lt;/em&gt; they were breached? And perhaps most importantly, have they changed their password (yes, almost always singular) across the other services they use? And so Have I Been Pwned was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll save the history lesson for the years between then and today because there are presently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/&quot;&gt;106 blog posts with the HIBP tag&lt;/a&gt; you can go and read if you’re interested, let me just talk briefly about where the service is at today. It has almost 8B breached records, there are nearly 3M people subscribed to notifications, I’ve emailed those folks about a breach 7M times, there are 120k people monitoring domains they’ve done 230k searches for and I’ve emailed them another 1.1M times. There are 150k unique visitors to the site on a normal day, 10M on an abnormal day, another couple of million API hits to the breach API and then 10M a day to Pwned Passwords. Except even that number is getting smashed these days:&lt;/p&gt;

And there are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-uk-and-australian-governments-are-now-monitoring-their-gov-domains-on-have-i-been-pwned/&quot;&gt;governments around the world using it to protect their departments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/data-provided-by-the-estonian-central-criminal-police-is-now-searchable-on-have-i-been-pwned/&quot;&gt;the law enforcement agencies leveraging it for their investigations&lt;/a&gt; and all sorts of other use cases I never, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; saw coming (my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-legitimisation-of-have-i-been-pwned/&quot;&gt;legitimisation of HIBP post from last year&lt;/a&gt; has a heap of other examples). And to date, every line of code, every configuration and every breached record has been handled by me alone. There is no “HIBP team”, there’s one guy keeping the whole thing afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wanted an infographic to explain the architecture, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/applied-azure-infographic-of-how-have-i/&quot;&gt;I sat there and built the whole thing myself by hand&lt;/a&gt;. I manually sourced every single logo of a pwned company, cropping it, resizing it and optimising it. Each and every disclosure to an organisation that didn't even know their data was out there fell to me (and trust me, that's &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; time-consuming and has proven to be the single biggest bottleneck to loading new data). Every media interview, every support request and frankly, pretty much every single thing you could possibly conceive of was done by just one person in their spare time. This isn't just a workload issues either; I was becoming increasingly conscious of the fact that I was the single point of failure. And that needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-s-time-to-grow-up&quot;&gt;It's Time to Grow Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a long intro but I wanted to set the scene before I got to the point of this blog post: it’s time for HIBP to grow up. It’s time to go from that one guy doing what he can in his available time to a better-resourced and better-funded structure that's able to do way more than what I ever could on my own. To better understand why I’m writing this now, let me share an image from Google Analytics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/05/image-10.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That graph is the 12 months to Jan 18 this year and the spike corresponds with the loading of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/&quot;&gt;Collection #1 credential stuffing list&lt;/a&gt;. It also corresponds with the day I headed off to Europe for a couple of weeks of “business as usual” conferences, preceded by several days of hanging out with my 9-year old son and good friends in a log cabin in the Norwegian snow. I was being simultaneously bombarded by an unprecedented level of emails, tweets, phone calls and every other imaginable channel due to the &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; attention HIBP was getting around the world, and also turning things off, sitting by a little fireplace in the snow and enjoying good drinks and good conversation. At that moment, I realised I was getting very close to burn-out. I was pretty confident I wasn’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; burned out yet, but I also became aware I could see that point in the not too distant future if I didn’t make some important changes in my life. (I’d love to talk more about that in the future as there are some pretty significant lessons in there, but for now, I just want to set the context as to the timing and talk about what happens next.) All of this was going on at the same time as me travelling the world, speaking at events, running workshops and doing a gazillion other things just to keep life ticking along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, it's been an enormously stressful year dealing with it all. The extra attention HIBP started getting in Jan never returned to 2018 levels, it just kept growing and growing. I made various changes to adjust to the workload, perhaps one of the most publicly obvious being a massive decline in engagement over social media, especially Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/06/image-1.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until (and including) December last year in that graph, I was tweeting an average of 1,141 times per month (for some reason, Twitter's export feature didn't include May and June 2017 and only half of July so I've dropped those months from the graph). From Feb to May this year, that number has dropped to 315 so I've backed off social to the tune of 72% since January. That may seem like a frivolous fact to focus on, but it's a quantifiable number that's directly attributable to the impact the growth of HIBP was having on my life. Same again if you look at my blog post cadence; I've religiously maintained my weekly update videos but have had to cut way back on all the other technical posts I've otherwise so loved writing over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got home from that trip, I started having some casual conversations with a couple of organisations I thought might be interested in acquiring HIBP. These were chats with people I already knew in places I respected so it was a low-friction “put out the feelers” sort of situation. It’s not the first time I’d had discussions like this – I’d done this several times before in response to organisations reaching out and asking what my appetite for acquisition was like – but it was the first time since the overhead of managing the service had gone off the charts. There was genuine enthusiasm which is great, but I quickly realised that when it comes to discussions of this nature, I was in well over my head. Sure, I can handle billions of breached records and single-handedly run a massive online data breach services that’s been used by hundreds of millions of people, but this was a whole different ballgame. It was time to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-svalbard&quot;&gt;Project Svalbard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in April during a regular catchup with the folks at KPMG about some otherwise mundane financial stuff (I've met with advisers regularly as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/10-personal-finance-lessons-for-technology-professionals/&quot;&gt;my own financial state became more complex&lt;/a&gt;), they suggested I have a chat with their Mergers and Acquisition (M&amp;amp;A) practice about finding a new home for HIBP. I was comfy doing that; we have a long relationship and they understand not just HIBP, but the broader spectrum of the cyber things I do day to day. It wasn't a hard decision to make - I needed help and they had the right experience and the right expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meeting with the M&amp;amp;A folks, it quickly became apparent how much support I really needed. The most significant thing that comes to mind is that I'd never really taken the time just to step back and look at what HIBP actually does. That might sound odd, but as it's grown organically over the years and I've built it out in response to a combination of what I think it should do and where the demand is, I've not taken the time to step back and look at the whole thing holistically. Nor have I taken enough time to look at what it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do; I'm going to talk more about that later in this post, but there's so much potential to do so much more and I really needed the support of people that specialise in finding the value in a business to help me see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first tasks was to come up with a project name for the acquisition because apparently, that's what you do with these things. There were many horribly kitschy options and many others that leaned on overused infosec buzzwords, and then I had a thought: what's that massive repository of seeds up in the Arctic Circle? I'd seen references to it before and the idea of a huge vault stockpiling something valuable for the betterment of humanity started to really resonate. Turns out &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault&quot;&gt;the place is called Svalbard&lt;/a&gt; and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2019/05/svalbard_global_seed_vault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Svalbard&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also turns out the place is part of Norway and all these things combined started to make it sound like a befitting name, beginning with the obvious analogy of storing a massive quantity of &quot;units&quot;. There's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_OEsf-1qgY&quot;&gt;a neat video from a few years ago&lt;/a&gt; which talks about the capacity being about a billion seeds; not quite as many records as are in HIBP, but you get the idea. Then there's the name: it's a bit weird and hard to pronounce for those not familiar with it (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrxlVylQ-dE&quot;&gt;this video helps&lt;/a&gt;), kinda like... pwned. And finally, Norway has a lot of significance for me being &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/97530814&quot;&gt;the first international talk I did&lt;/a&gt; almost 5 years ago to the day. I spoke in front of an overflowing room and as the audience exited, every single one of them dropped a green rating card into the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was an absolute turning point in my career. It was also in Norway this January that HIBP went nuts as you saw in the earlier graph. It was there in that little log cabin in the snow that I realised it was time for HIBP to grow up. And by pure coincidence, I'm posting this today from Norway, back again for my 6th year in a row of NDC Oslo. So as you can see, Svalbard feels like a fitting name 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-commitments-for-the-future-of-hibp&quot;&gt;My Commitments for the Future of HIBP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean if HIBP is acquired by another company? In all honesty, I don't know precisely what that will look like so let me just candidly share my thoughts on it as they stand today and there are a few really important points I want to emphasise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freely available consumer searches should remain freely available.&lt;/strong&gt; The service became this successful because I made sure there were no barriers in the way for people searching their data and I absolutely, positively want that to remain the status quo. That's number 1 on the list here for a reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'll remain a part of HIBP.&lt;/strong&gt; I fully intend to be part of the acquisition, that is some company gets me along with the project. HIBP's brand is intrinsically tied to mine and at present, it needs me to go along with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to build out much, much more capabilities wise.&lt;/strong&gt; There's a heap of things I want to do with HIBP which I simply couldn't do on my own. This is a project with enormous potential beyond what it's already achieved and I want to be the guy driving that forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to reach a much larger audience than I do at present.&lt;/strong&gt; The numbers are massive as they are, but it's still only a tiny slice of the online community that's learning of their exposure in data breaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's much more that can be done to change consumer behaviour.&lt;/strong&gt; Credential stuffing, for example, is a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; problem right now and it only exists due to password reuse. I want HIBP to play a much bigger role in changing the behaviour of how people manage their online accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organisations can benefit much more from HIBP.&lt;/strong&gt; Following on from the previous point, the services people are using can do a much better job of protecting their customers from this form of attack and data from HIBP can (and for some organisations, already does) play a significant role in that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There should be more disclosure - and more data.&lt;/strong&gt; I mentioned earlier how responsible disclosure was massively burdensome and Svalbard gives me the chance to fix that. There's a whole heap of organisations out there that don't know they've been breached simply because I haven't had the bandwidth to deal with it all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In considering which organisations are best positioned to help me achieve this, there's a solid selection that are at the front of my mind. There's also a bunch that I have enormous respect for but are less well-equipped to help me achieve this. As the process plays out, I'll be working with KPMG to more clearly identify which organisations fit into the first category. As I'm sure you can imagine, there are some very serious discussions to be had: where HIBP would fit into the organisation, how they'd help me achieve those bullet-pointed objectives above and frankly, whether it's the right place for such a valuable service to go. There are also some major personal considerations for me including who I'd feel comfortable working with, the impact on travel and family and, of course, the financial side of the whole thing. I'll be honest - it's equal parts daunting and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I began contacting each stakeholder that would have an interest in the outcome of Project Svalbard before making it public in this blog post. I explained the drivers behind it and the intention for this exercise to make HIBP not just more sustainable, but also for it to make a much bigger impact on the data breach landscape. This has already led to some really productive discussions with organisations that could help HIBP make a much more positive impact on the industry. There's been a lot of enthusiasm and support for this process which is reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question I expect I'll get is &quot;why don't I turn it into a more formal, commercially-centric structure and just hire people?&quot; I've certainly had that opportunity for some time either by funding it myself or via the various VCs that have come knocking over the years. The main reason I decided not to go down that path is that it &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; increases my responsibilities at a time where I really need to reduce the burden on me. As of today, I can't just switch off for a week and frankly, if I tried even for a day I'd be worried about missing something important. In time, building up a company myself might allow me to do that but only after investing a substantial amount of time (and money) which is just not something I want to do at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm enormously excited about the potential of Project Svalbard. In those early discussions with other organisations, I'm already starting to see a pattern emerge around better managing the entire data breach ecosystem. Imagine a future where I'm able to source and process much more data, proactively reach out to impacted organisations, guide them through the process of handling the incident, ensure impacted individuals like you and me better understand our exposure (and what to do about it) and ultimately, reduce the impact of data breaches on organisations and consumers alike. And it goes much further than that too because there's a lot more that can be done post-breach, especially to tackle attacks such as the huge rate of credential stuffing we're seeing these days. I'm really happy with what HIBP has been able to do to date, but I've only scratched the surface of potential with it so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made this decision at a time where I have complete control of the process. I'm not under any duress (not beyond the high workload, that is) and I've got time to let the acquisition search play out organically and allow it to find the best possible match for the project. And as I've always done with HIBP, I'm proceeding with complete transparency by detailing that process here. I'm &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; conscious of the trust that people have put in me with this service and every single day I'm reminded of the responsibility that brings with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HIBP may only be less than 6 years old, but it’s the culmination of a life’s work. I still have these vivid memories stretching back to the mid-90's when I first started building software for the web and had a dream of creating something big; “Isn’t it amazing that I can sit here at home and write code that could have a real impact on the world one day”. I had a few false starts along the way and it took a combination of data breaches, cloud and an independent career that allowed me the opportunity to make HIBP what it is today, but it's finally what I'd always hoped I'd be able to do. Project Svalbard is the realisation of that dream and I'm enormously excited about the opportunities that will come as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Project Svalbard: The Future of Have I Been Pwned</og:title>
<og:description>Back in 2013, I was beginning to get the sense that data breaches were becoming a big thing. The prevalence of them seemed to be really ramping up as was the impact they were having on those of us that found ourselves in them, myself included. Increasingly, I was writing</og:description>
