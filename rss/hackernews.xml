<title>Non-Posix File Systems</title>
<link>https://weinholt.se/articles/non-posix-filesystems/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://weinholt.se/articles/non-posix-filesystems/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt;. They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized file system semantics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use a file system through a library instead of going through the operating system there are some extra possibilities. You are no longer required to obey the host operating system’s semantics for filenames. You get to decide if you use &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; to separate directory components (or something else altogether). Maybe you don’t even use strings for filenames. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/weinholt/fs-fatfs&quot;&gt;fs-fatfs&lt;/a&gt; library uses a list of strings, so it’s up to the caller to define a directory separator for themselves. While working on that library, I was driven to write down some ideas that I’ve previously run across and found inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first hierarchical file system was developed for Multics. It is described in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multicians.org/fjcc4.html&quot;&gt;A General-Purpose File System For Secondary Storage&lt;/a&gt; (1965) by Robert C. Daley and Peter G. Neumann. There are several things that I find astounding about this paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were apparently no hierarchical file systems before Multics. The references do no cite any previous work on this and I haven’t found any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy in computing was a big consideration even back then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern hierarchical file system are essentially unchanged from 1965, but some features disappeared along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interesting backup system described in this paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper describes these concepts that we still use today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Root directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tree name, i.e. the name of a file or directory in the tree structure. Akin to realpath(3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path name, which is like a tree name, but it is conceptually different because components can be links. The paper used &lt;code&gt;&quot;:&quot;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to separate directories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relative paths. They used an initial &lt;code&gt;&quot;:&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;&quot;./&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (or empty) and &lt;code&gt;&quot;*&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in place of &lt;code&gt;&quot;..&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of &lt;code&gt;&quot;cd ..&quot;&lt;/code&gt; you used &lt;code&gt;&quot;CHANGEDIRECTORY :*&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbolic links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access control using access control lists (showed up relatively recently in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read, execute and write modes on files and directories. Execute on a directory means permission to search it, just as in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segments and segment numbers (file descriptions and file descriptors, respectively, if I’m not mistaken).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Unix took inspiration from Multics and simplified things. What was lost? Whoever implemented the file system for Unix stopped reading the paper somewhere around subsection 2.3. There are at least these features we’re missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access control lists can define a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TRAP&lt;/span&gt; for a user. Users can refuse to use TRAPs and instead get an error. Otherwise TRAPs call a named function at the time of the access. They can be used to implement smart files that can e.g. monitor file usage or apply password-based file locks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Someone will undoubtedly insert eBPF into the Linux &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;VFS&lt;/span&gt; soon and we will have invented TRAPs again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multics fully separated the append mode and the write mode and made it available to users. You could actually have files and &lt;em&gt;directories&lt;/em&gt; that were writable but not appendable, or appendable but not writable (or both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Append-only &lt;em&gt;files&lt;/em&gt; exist on Linux through file attributes settable by the super user or processes with &lt;code&gt;CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE&lt;/code&gt;. This is very weak sauce. Immutable directories exist, but not append-only directories. And of course there is no way to have a writable file or directory that can’t grow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directory entries that point to secondary storage. &lt;em&gt;This is a game changer for file system management.&lt;/em&gt; More on this below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiple-level-storage-and-backups&quot;&gt;Multiple-level storage and backups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files in the Multics file system could have directory entries that point to a secondary storage medium. At the time the secondary media were tapes, but today they could be mechanical hard drives, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drives or network servers. But what is the point of having a file that isn’t there? It’s really quite clever and it only gets more clever the more you look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a Multics system was running out of disk space it could remove unused files from the primary medium, but keep the directory entries.&lt;/strong&gt; If you then tried to open such a file it would ask you to wait while the file is being made available. It would issue instructions to the operator (perhaps later a tape robot) to have them retrieve the required tapes for restoring the file. Very useful when disks were small and tapes were plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets even better when you consider backups. Today if you need to restore a Linux system from backups you do it this way: find the oldest full backup and restore it, then restore each incremental backup, going from oldest to newest. This means that the system can’t be used until you’ve completely restored it from the backups. With today’s disk sizes that could take a very, very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multics backups are done differently. To restore a completely hosed system you first restore the system files, which will allow you to boot. Then you restore the &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt; incremental backup. After this the file system will contain the most current directory entries. &lt;strong&gt;Just restore one incremental backup tape and all the files are already in their right places. This is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; faster than waiting for everything to be restored!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is only the latest incremental backup required to get everything back in its place and working? The clever part is that the files might not yet be on the disk. In fact, most files will probably be on another backup medium. But the most recently used files have been restored, so you can most likely do useful work already, and all other files have their directory entries. If you try to open a file that hasn’t been restored then you’re asked to wait and the operator is told which tape to put in to get the file back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is something like this offered on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt;-compatible file system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Xerox Alto was also a system of many firsts. It is most famous for having the first windowing &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, which inspired Apple’s design, which then inspired Microsoft’s design. Of course it had a hierarchical file system with version numbers, and even a network file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to highlight the interesting disk structure of the Alto file system, which is described in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-open-operating-system-for-a-single-user-machine/&quot;&gt;An Open Operating System for a Single-User Machine&lt;/a&gt; (1979) by Butler Lampson and Robert F. Sproull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designers of the system were concerned about data loss caused by hardware issues and buggy software. They came up with a feature to protect the user’s data against loss of any block on the disk. (Unless the user data was in that lost block, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All blocks on the disk have a label that contains these fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A file identifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A version number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A page number (block index)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A next link (pointer to the next block in the file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A previous link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The label means that each block is self-identifying. By my count this type of disk had an additional 14 bytes of label per each 512 byte block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the disk structure is damaged then a special program called the &lt;em&gt;scavenger&lt;/em&gt; will iterate over all blocks and recover the structure.&lt;/strong&gt; Contrast this to a file system like ext4 where a damaged structure can mean that huge swathes of data are rendered inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scavenger was also used to upgrade the disk structure.&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine converting in-place between ext4, btrfs or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ZFS&lt;/span&gt; by just running a scavenger for the new disk structure. It would e.g. regard the existing ext4 metadata as nonsense and build a new disk structure based on btrfs by using the labels. (It will not work with these specific file systems, but it demonstrates the principle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don’t we have this today? Nobody wants to build a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt; file system that uses labels because the disks we’re using have 512-byte or 4096-byte blocks and no room for a label. A label would have a very small overhead for each block, but even a very small overhead like this is not acceptable to file system designers. More seriously, it would mess up mmap(2). There are disks with slightly larger blocks meant to store a label, but they are more expensive and not very common. So we’re left with fragile file system structures and the sage advice that you’re supposed to have backups anyway (for which, see previous section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best modern alternative is something like Btrfs or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ZFS&lt;/span&gt;. Blocks are checksummed and those checksums are stored next to the pointers in the disk structure. A modern version of the Alto file system should certainly have checksums, but not using labels gives weaker protections than what the Alto file system provided. If you want to see how relevant the Alto file system design is today, just read what using ZFS protects against, but then remember that it doesn’t use labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hydra is another historical operating system with innovations in the file system. It is described in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/os/Qual/papers/hydra.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HYDRA&lt;/span&gt;: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System&lt;/a&gt; (1974) by W. Wulf, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, A. Jones, R. Levin, C. Pierson, and F. Pollack at Carnegie-Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydra does away with the idea of ownership and a hierarchy of ever more privileged components. It uses a fundamentally different concept of protection and security than what &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt; is based on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Technologists like hierarchical structures – they are elegant; but experience from the real world shows they are not viable security structures. The problem, then, which &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HYDRA&lt;/span&gt; attempts to face squarely, is to maintain order in a nonhierarchical environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HYDRA&lt;/span&gt;: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System (1974)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resources that need protection, such as files, are called &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt;. You can apply an &lt;em&gt;operation&lt;/em&gt; to an object, such as reading or writing. But to do so you need a reference to that object, which is called a &lt;em&gt;capability&lt;/em&gt;. You can even know a file’s identity, but without the reference you can’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar, but not identical, to a safe programming language where you can’t modify an object (such as a vector) if you don’t have a reference to that object and the procedure that performs the operation (e.g. &lt;code&gt;vector-set!&lt;/code&gt;). The analogue stretches pretty far actually: in the Hydra design it is even possible for objects (such as files) to become inaccessible and be subject to garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that in Multics you could run code dynamically with TRAPs. This was very weak sauce when compared to what you could do in Hydra. &lt;strong&gt;In Hydra it was possible to design the normal read, write (etc) operations yourself, and even provide additional operations.&lt;/strong&gt; A file could be backed by an efficient binary data structure, but present itself as a text file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper gives an example of a researcher who has very specific requirements for data protection. You will need to read the paper to see all the requirements, but basically the researcher wants control over a file, but also wants others to have partial control over the same file. The file structure is delicate and needs to be protected against corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This abstraction is critical in protecting users from file representations, and I consider any file system which does not support at least this form abstraction to now be hopelessly behind the state of the art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– joe in fa.works, July 1981 (message id anews.Aucbvax.2321)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people would not even be able to conceive that a &lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt; could fulfill the researcher’s requirements. Today the researcher in question would have to use a network service that implements an &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to enforce the requirements. As usually happens with these things, that service would probably have some security vulnerability that lets users do more than they were supposed to (e.g. read any file, write to other files, or start a shell). But on Hydra it’s just an object with operations that implement the desired semantics, and it can’t be used to break the protection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydra’s design is still relevant today. We regularly see problems caused by the so called “confused deputy”, which is when a system was tricked into performing an action that the initiator of the action was not supposed to have the permission to do, but a middle-layer (deputy) did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of a capability system in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt; is causing real world damage that affects billions of people. It might be an app on your phone that spies on all your messages, a JavaScript package that sends all your SSH and Bitcoin private keys to a thief, or your browser might be exploited, make itself root by running sudo with your privileges and then install a rootkit. Why can your browser run sudo? Sudo is by design a confused deputy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose only your &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; client had the operation required to use your SSH keys. Suppose the operation to export those SSH keys was only accessible via your login session when you specifically used your keyboard or mouse to make that export. This would be more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the file system protected your files against data corruption (e.g. making it impossible to write a bad &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;)? Sounds pretty good to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multics enabled a superior paradigm for storage management and backups. Xerox Alto allowed a disk structure to be restored even if all metadata blocks had been damaged. Hydra used a capability system to provide a powerful protection mechanism for data. All of these enabled interesting types of functionality that we are missing in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POSIX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many good ideas in historical file systems that have been completely dropped today. I’m building some sort of operating system in Scheme in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://scheme.fail&quot;&gt;Loko Scheme&lt;/a&gt; project and would like to explore these ideas there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating Intuit and its marketing of TurboTax products, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/series/the-turbotax-trap&quot;&gt;ProPublica’s reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the Silicon Valley company deceived tax filers into paying when they could have filed for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;The FTC probe, run out of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, centers on whether Intuit violated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/what-we-do/enforcement-authority&quot;&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; against unfair and deceptive practices in commerce. One focus of the investigation is whether TurboTax marketing misdirected customers who were eligible to file their taxes for free into paid products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;The investigation, which has been underway for more than a year, was revealed publicly in a recent Intuit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048680-Intuit-Inc-s-Petition-to-Quash-in-Part-May-19.html&quot;&gt;filing&lt;/a&gt; in which the company’s lawyers appealed to the commission to limit the scope of its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300 hide-lg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.0&quot;&gt;Intuit produced half a million pages of documents in response to the FTC’s first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2018/01/so-you-received-cid-faqs-small-businesses&quot;&gt;civil investigative demand&lt;/a&gt; — a kind of subpoena — last year. The request for records came after ProPublica’s reporting on how Intuit used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines&quot;&gt;a variety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes&quot;&gt;of tactics&lt;/a&gt; to divert customers away from a free TurboTax product and toward paid versions. Under a longstanding agreement with the IRS called Free File, Intuit and other tax prep companies promised to offer free products to most Americans; in exchange, the IRS agreed not to create a free government tax filing option that would compete with the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;This May, FTC investigators ramped up their probe by issuing a second civil investigative demand to Intuit. In response to the latest demand, Intuit’s lawyers took the rare step of escalating matters, filing a petition asking FTC commissioners to step in and significantly narrow the scope of what it had to produce. They also cited the difficulty of working in the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.2&quot;&gt;The new FTC request “is incredibly burdensome” with “broad document demands,” wrote Intuit’s lawyers, from the firm WilmerHale. “And notwithstanding the new and unanticipated stresses of work in the COVID-19 environment, the staff seeks investigational hearings with at least eight different Intuit employees, and the CID includes a sixteen-topic corporate hearing notice that will require at least five Intuit employees to testify over several days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.3&quot;&gt;In a bipartisan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048679-Commission-Order-Denying-Intuit-Petition-to.html&quot;&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; written by Commissioner Noah Phillips and issued Aug. 17, the commission rejected Intuit’s petition and instructed the company to comply by Sept. 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;The escalating fight over company records suggests that the FTC has significant concerns about Intuit’s conduct, according to David Vladeck, a former head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection and a professor at Georgetown Law.&lt;/p&gt;

An Intuit spokesman also declined to comment on the investigation but said in a statement: “Intuit has a long-standing commitment to free tax preparation, including 55 million completely free tax returns filed over the last 5 years, more than all other tax prep software companies combined. TurboTax prominently and transparently discloses the price of its paid products and is at all times clear and fair with its customers.”&lt;/p&gt;

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed &lt;strong&gt;randomized controlled trial (RCT).&lt;/strong&gt; An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;viewer-f6k24&quot; class=&quot;XzvDs _208Ie tFDi5 blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5 public-DraftStyleDefault-block-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-text-ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death.&lt;/strong&gt; These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;viewer-9nlvf&quot; class=&quot;XzvDs _208Ie tFDi5 blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5 public-DraftStyleDefault-block-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-text-ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, &lt;strong&gt;publication bias&lt;/strong&gt; may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included. Researchers do not always agree on which studies to include, and differences in inclusion criteria have led to similar meta-analyses producing opposite results.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115934&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; class=&quot;_2qJYG&quot;&gt;&lt;u class=&quot;sDZYg&quot;&gt;This has occurred&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in studies of Vitamin D and fracture risk in older adults, with some meta-analyses showing zero benefit to Vitamin D and others showing a decreased risk of fracture, even though they included many of the same studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Many meta-analyses can only be done by combining trials that differ in important details, like the age of participants, treatment dosages, or definition of endpoints. Combining these may be feasible, but the clinical relevance may change when disparate groups are lumped together. For example, suppose we want to know if Vitamin D prevents asthma attacks in children. If a meta-analysis shows a small benefit to Vitamin D when all ages are combined, but the individual small studies in children did not show a benefit, what do I advise a 10 year old with asthma?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, most high-quality meta-analyses show similar results to our individual randomized controlled trials: &lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D does not appear to prevent disease in healthy adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;public-DraftStyleDefault-ol&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;viewer-f3qjq&quot; class=&quot;public-DraftStyleDefault-orderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-list-ltr public-DraftStyleDefault-reset _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_208Ie _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fracture prevention in elderly nursing home residents&lt;/strong&gt; (when also given with calcium): This is not surprising. We know that Vitamin D and calcium can prevent bone loss in severe Vitamin D deficiency. Elderly adults who are not getting outside are more likely to be severely deficient in Vitamin D, and supplements likely help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_208Ie _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asthma and respiratory infection&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D seems to reduce asthma attacks in adults with mild to moderate disease, and daily or weekly Vitamin D seems to prevent acute respiratory infection in those with Vitamin D less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/l). There is considerable excitement around Vitamin D's potential role in Covid treatment, though we do not yet have enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_208Ie _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer mortality&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D does not appear to prevent cancer, but may reduce death rates from cancer overall (when all cancers are combined) when Vitamin D is taken for several years. It is not known whether Vitamin D itself fights cancer. It could also be that individuals with cancer are more prone to developing severe Vitamin D deficiency, which leads to bone loss, fragility, and fractures, which increase mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_208Ie _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atopic dermatitis (eczema)&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D supplementation may prevent exacerbation of eczema. There are only a small number of trials, with small numbers of patients, so this requires more research.&lt;/p&gt;

How can we reconcile promising early observational studies linking Vitamin D to most major causes of death with our current results? One thing that seems increasingly clear is that in most cases low Vitamin D (truly low Vitamin D) is a marker of poor health rather than a cause. Vitamin D is made in the skin after exposure to sunlight. A chronically ill, frail individual may leave the house less often, leading to lower Vitamin D levels. Fixing the Vitamin D will not fix the chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;viewer-29qeo&quot; class=&quot;XzvDs _208Ie tFDi5 blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2QAo- _25MYV _6RI6N tFDi5 public-DraftStyleDefault-block-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-text-ltr&quot;&gt;In some situations low Vitamin D does contribute to illness, but this is generally in cases of severe deficiency. We know that severe Vitamin D deficiency leads to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. This provides a plausible scenario by which Vitamin D deficiency could increase mortality in the elderly: Without sunlight, a frail elderly woman may develop bone loss, increasing her risk of fractures. Fractures in the elderly have shockingly high mortality rates – so in this case a severe Vitamin D deficiency could contribute to death, and supplementation would help. For the majority of healthy adults, supplementation is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

In many of the studies reviewed here, Vitamin D was given to a general population of older adults. They were not selected for Vitamin D deficiency. This was done on purpose to allow us to determine whether we should advise everyone to take Vitamin D supplements for disease prevention. If we only studied those with severe deficiency, we likely would have seen more benefits from supplementation. But we already have very good evidence that severe Vitamin D deficiency (i.e. under 10 ng/ml or 25 nmol/l) is detrimental and should be treated. Future studies will need to evaluate milder Vitamin D deficiencies to see if those levels require treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

Recognize that Vitamin D is not a panacea. It is an essential hormone, definitely, but not a magical pill that will ward off disease. There are conditions that benefit from Vitamin D supplementation - for hypoparathyroidism, a condition that can cause dangerously low calcium levels, Vitamin D is lifesaving. For otherwise healthy adults, the benefit is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

Use a reasoned approach to supplementation. There are benefits to Vitamin D in cases of severe deficiency (not mild deficiency). If you are elderly, frail, and not getting sunlight, there is a chance you are significantly deficient in Vitamin D. If you think you may be deficient, you can check this with a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;

Act in moderation. Low to moderate doses of Vitamin D (e.g. 400 to 2000 IUs daily) have proven to be safe in trials. If you think there is a benefit and we just don't have enough data to prove it yet, you may be right. We do know the harms of taking too much, though, so supplement in moderation. And if you are taking Vitamin D, ask your doctor to check your blood levels.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ad Fraud on LinkedIn</title>
<link>https://www.samueljscott.com/2020/09/08/linkedin-ad-fraud/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.samueljscott.com/2020/09/08/linkedin-ad-fraud/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The LinkedIn Ads network is likely awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform’s value extremely dubious, according to a new study from global digital agency RMG that the company shared exclusively with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago, RMG founding partner Ryan Gellis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryan-gellis_theory-the-linkedin-ad-network-is-full-of-activity-6700077824360910848-LysO/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;posted a thread&lt;/a&gt; wondering if LinkedIn “is full of fraudulent accounts and unchecked misclicks that artificially inflate the cost of advertising and result in poor performance compared to other ad networks.” The ensuing discussion inspired him to look into the issue further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuyxgWuiRM&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Gellis goes through his findings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKuyxgWuiRM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;in this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;. For the test, RMG promoted a webinar by targeting c-certain c-suite executives at large companies in the United States based on their job titles. The ad encouraged them to click to sign up for for event for free.
&lt;p&gt;The first issue the agency found was the projected versus actual cost per click. LinkedIn estimated a $25 average CPC. The actual campaign CPC was nearly $45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s the point of forecasting if you project one cost and then the actual cost ends up being 200% the projection?” Gellis asks in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real issue was the source of the clicks themselves. LinkedIn’s ad platform reported 11 clicks. RMG’s logs showed ten clicks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, the digital experience analytics platform that RMG uses, stated that eight people registered for the webinar. However, the true number of registrations was zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Zero people signed up for the webinar from that specific campaign,” Gellis told me in an interview. “That’s kind of the punch line and why I believe this is newsworthy. Nobody signed up. In fact, nobody even exhibited what I believe is real user behavior on the site after clicking the ad. That is also true of all the other ads we ran on LinkedIn. We had a total of 0 people ever “sign up” on any ad we ran during our testing on LinkedIn — regardless of the ad format or messaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmgmedia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;RMG&lt;/a&gt; suspects bot activity or misattributed misclicks had been the cause because visitors would bounce away from the webinar’s landing page before it even had a chance to render — in other words, they would click the LinkedIn advertisement and then leave the website in less than 1.3 seconds. In addition, FullStory reported mouse movements that were nothing like what an actual human would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As far as we’re concerned, the LinkedIn ad network basically has fraudulent clicks and/or misclicks that don’t get attributed to the users that are being passed through as leads in campaigns,” Gellis says in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the simple size in RMG’s one-day test was extremely small. The target audience size was 16,000. The number of impressions would be between 680 and 2,000. The cost was $250. But Gellis told me that the results match a prior, larger test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-27064 lazyload&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20660%20197'%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot; alt=&quot;linkedin ads&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; data-src=&quot;https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-27064&quot; src=&quot;https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png&quot; alt=&quot;linkedin ads&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; data-eio=&quot;l&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a $3,000 campaign in March, LinkedIn reported 256 clicks with an average CPC of $11. The company received zero leads from all of the clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ll see the call to action is ‘Request Demo,'” Gellis said. “So, arguably, a user who sees this ad and clicks legitimately on it will be looking to get a demo of the analytics tool we were marketing. If the ads were giving us behavior like this on a $3,000-per-month budget, it’s unlikely they would have performed any better with additional budget.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RMG charges that LinkedIn’s advertising is on a closed network and does not follow the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;standards for digital advertising&lt;/a&gt;. (The IAB did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing RMG’s findings, a LinkedIn spokesperson sent me the following company statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“LinkedIn is a members-first organization and our &lt;u&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsmfrYAHwHhV6tM-nG54kogFWEw&quot;&gt;Ads program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; is designed to ensure that only high-quality, relevant ads are served to our members. We prohibit the use of bots or other automated fraudulent methods to access our services, as they are in violation of the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNErEgCF6J2mC2B2u6Rnd32Ialafiw&quot;&gt;User Agreement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Additionally, LinkedIn is a member of the IAB and works closely with the organization and its members to help develop standards for the digital advertising industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when summarizing his findings in the video, Gellis is skeptical of LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As far as we can tell, LinkedIn is basically a money pit,” he says. “You’re not going to get the performance that you would expect out of the network.”&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Study: “LinkedIn is Basically a Money Pit” Because of Ad Fraud</og:title>
<og:description>LinkedIn Ads are awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform's value extremely dubious, according to a new study from RMG.</og:description>

<title>GDPR Violation: Scribd acquires PII on 500M users in a deal with LinkedIn</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thehftguy.com/2020/09/01/gdpr-violation-scribd-acquires-pii-on-500m-users-in-a-deal-with-linkedin/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a LinkedIn account, you were signed up to SlideShare automatically without your knowledge or consent. Your account including all your personal information will be sold to ScribD unless you opt-out now. See “How to Opt Out” at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early August, ScribD &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/scribd-acquires-slideshare/&quot;&gt;announced the acquisition of SlideShare for an undisclosed amount&lt;/a&gt;. I personally never registered to either services, no clue what ScribD except I think I heard the name before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Received this email on my personal inbox index a few days after the annoncements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;13068&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://thehftguy.com/slideshare-email-highlight/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/slideshare-email-highlight.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;618,983&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;slideshare-email-highlight&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/slideshare-email-highlight.png?w=189&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/slideshare-email-highlight.png?w=618&quot; src=&quot;https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/slideshare-email-highlight.png?w=618&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13068&quot; srcset=&quot;https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/slideshare-email-highlight.png 618w, https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/slideshare-email-highlight.png?w=94 94w, https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/slideshare-email-highlight.png?w=189 189w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s puzzling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why was it send to me? I’ve never used SlideShare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where did they get my personal email? How did they get my full name too? (cut it out at the bottom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does it says I have an account? I sure as hell don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does it keep mentioning LinkedIn?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last but not least, why does it offer to me to opt-out of reselling my personal information? I 100% oppose to that. Not only PII transfer should be opt-in under GDPR but they shouldn’t possess my personal information in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, I’m accurately worried of anything trying to register as myself right now because &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehftguy.com/2020/08/12/a-haven-for-fraud-and-stolen-cards-or-how-my-wife-was-forced-to-quit-revolut/&quot;&gt;I was hit by identify fraud &lt;strong&gt;by Revolut&lt;/strong&gt; a couple months ago&lt;/a&gt; that was a whole nightmare to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Root Cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After further reading and investigation. Here’s some explanations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-is-buying-slideshare-2012-5&quot;&gt;SlideShare was acquired by LinkedIn (Microsoft)&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 for $119M dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;SlideShare is owned by Linked, that’s why the email refers to and links to LinkedIn multiple times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the personal information originates from LinkedIn (names, email, phone numbers, etc…). I do have a profile with some info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn ostensibly merged all the LinkedIn accounts into SlideShare at some point during the past 8 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of the acquisition deal. All that personal data on LinkedIn/SlideShare will be transferred to ScribD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classic business deal to bundle and resell PII through a subsidiary. A quick google search says there are 500M users on LinkedIn (250M active in the past three months). There were other people who noticed the same thing on the internet and friends who got the same hints, evidence beyond reasonable doubt that ALL THE 500M LinkedIn userbase is being sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder that ScribD is interested in buying SlideShare… with 500M unwilling users served on a plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Opt Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow this guide. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/help/slideshare/answer/53671&quot;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/help/slideshare/answer/53671&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sign in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/&quot;&gt;SlideShare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Menu “Account Settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, Delete my Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“””Your account is deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that it takes about 24 hours for your content to stop showing up on the SlideShare search pages and it will take 2-3 days for it to be completely removed from Google Search (we have no control over that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sad to see you go. Hope to see you again.”””&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Check your LinkedIn resell-your-info settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you’re there, might as well check your linkedin settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to LinkedIn =&amp;gt; Me =&amp;gt; Settings and Privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage who can discover your profile from your email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage who can discover your profile from your phone number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salary data on LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who can see your email address =&amp;gt; Only visible to me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who can see your Last Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profile Visibility of LinkedIn (to non linkedin users)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Word (your profile is shown in some word features)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of it is enabled by default. You may want to keep a LinkedIn profile (it’s useful for jobs) but not display all your personal information wide open to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PandaDoc employees arrested in Belarus after founders protest against violence</title>
<link>https://savepandadoc.org/en/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://savepandadoc.org/en/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;26.057142857143&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't be silent! Publicise the page everywhere using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SavePandaDoc&amp;amp;f=live&quot; class=&quot;text-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#SavePandaDoc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;53.597697257027&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 2, the Belarus government ordered searches to be conducted at the Minsk office of PandaDoc. During the search, more than 20 employees were prevented from leaving and 7 of them were taken into custody and detained for further interrogation. Some of these employees were subsequently taken into custody from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next two days, the Financial Investigation Department (FID) arm of the Belarus government interviewed more than one hundred company employees. During those two days, the employees that had been taken into custody were also denied the rights to legal counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on September 4, 2020 we were told that a criminal case was retroactively initiated against PandaDoc employees under part 4 of article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus. Our employees are accused of taking one hundred and seven thousand Belarusian rubles (~40k USD) from the corporate accounts of the company in Minsk abusing their positions, thus causing damage to the State. As a result, our employees have now been placed into custody for two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We declare that this accusation by the State of Belarus is completely untrue and has no grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the company’s activities in Belarus were conducted since its inception in full compliance with the law. Several international audits and inspections by EY and other reputable companies over the last years prove that the company adhered to all regulations and laws prevalent in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recent events in Belarus have demonstrated, it is a common practice of the Belarusian government to oppress political opponents. In this case, the authorities have taken four completely innocent people hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This action is purely an act of repression against the founders of PandaDoc who have been supporting some of the victims of the Belarussian government in the weeks since the stolen Presidential election. The only purpose of this private initiative by Mikita and Sergey has been intended to help stop the violence and is in no way related to PandaDoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response the government has imprisoned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yulia Shardyko&lt;/strong&gt;, Accountant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dmitry Rabtsevich&lt;/strong&gt;, Director — Minsk office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viktor Kuvshinov&lt;/strong&gt;, Product director&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vladislav Mikholap&lt;/strong&gt;, HR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law in Belarus has ceased to exist. The authorities do not even bother to act according to the prevailing rules and laws of the country. The case and charges are fabricated cases upon political orders ordered from somewhere in the government. This affects everyone in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We ask of you:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Record a video in our support with the tag &lt;strong&gt;#SavePandaDoc&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To express your disagreement in the press, media and social networks with the &lt;strong&gt;#SavePandaDoc&lt;/strong&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect us to journalists and reporters that you know. Our contact is &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:savepandadoc@gmail.com&quot;&gt;savepandadoc@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are hoping that maximum publicity will show solidarity and pressure to have our colleagues released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Pandas&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Assange Hearing Day 6</title>
<link>https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-the-assange-hearing-day-6</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/09/your-man-in-the-public-gallery-the-assange-hearing-day-6</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to the Old Bailey today expecting to be awed by the majesty of the law, and left revolted by the sordid administration of injustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a romance which attaches to the Old Bailey. The name of course means fortified enclosure and it occupies a millennia old footprint on the edge of London’s ancient city wall. It is the site of the medieval Newgate Prison, and formal trials have taken place at the Old Bailey for at least 500 years, numbering in the hundreds of thousands. For the majority of that time, those convicted even of minor offences of theft were taken out and executed in the alleyway outside. It is believed that hundreds, perhaps thousands, lie buried under the pavements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hefty Gothic architecture of the current grand building dates back no further than 1905, and round the back and sides of that is wrapped some horrible cheap utility building from the 1930’s. It was through a tunnelled entrance into this portion that five of us, Julian’s nominated family and friends, made our nervous way this morning. We were shown to Court 10 up many stairs that seemed like the back entrance to a particularly unloved works canteen. Tiles were chipped, walls were filthy and flakes of paint hung down from crumbling ceilings. Only the security cameras watching us were new – so new, in fact, that little piles of plaster and brick dust lay under each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court 10 appeared to be a fairly bright and open modern box, with pleasant light woodwork, jammed as a mezzanine inside a great vault of the old building. A massive arch intruded incongruously into the space and was obviously damp, sheets of delaminating white paint drooping down from it like flags of forlorn surrender. The dock in which Julian would be held still had a bulletproof glass screen in front, like Belmarsh, but it was not boxed in. There was no top to the screen, no low ceiling, so sound could flow freely over and Julian seemed much more in the court. It also had many more and wider slits than the notorious Belmarsh Box, and Julian was able to communicate quite readily and freely through them with his lawyers, which this time he was not prevented from doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather to our surprise, nobody else was allowed into the public gallery of court 10 but us five. Others like John Pilger and Kristin Hrafnsson, editor in chief of Wikileaks, were shunted into the adjacent court 9 where a very small number were permitted to squint at a tiny screen, on which the sound was so inaudible John Pilger simply left. Many others who had expected to attend, such as Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders, were simply excluded, as were MPs from the German federal parliament (both the German MPs and Reporters Without Borders at least later got access to the inadequate video following strong representations from the German Embassy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason given that only five of us were allowed in the public gallery of some 40 seats was social distancing; except we were allowed to all sit together in consecutive seats in the front row. The two rows behind us remained completely empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish scene setting, Julian himself looked tidy and well groomed and dressed, and appeared to have regained a little lost weight, but with a definite unhealthy puffiness about his features. In the morning he appeared disengaged and disoriented rather as he had at Belmarsh, but in the afternoon he perked up and was very much engaged with his defence team, interacting as normally as could be expected in these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceedings started with formalities related to Julian’s release on the old extradition warrant and re-arrest under the new warrant, which had taken place this morning. Defence and prosecution both agreed that the points they had already argued on the ban on extradition for political offences were not affected by the superseding indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magistrate Baraitser then made a statement about access to the court by remote hearing, by which she meant online. She stated that a number of access details had been sent out by mistake by the court without her agreement. She had therefore revoked their access permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she spoke, we in the court had no idea what had happened, but outside some consternation was underway in that the online access of Amnesty International, of Reporters without Borders, of John Pilger and of forty others had been shut down. As these people were neither permitted to attend the court nor observe online, this was causing some consternation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser went on to say that it was important that the hearing was public, but she should only agree remote access where it was “in the interests of justice”, and having considered it she had decided it was not. She explained this by stating that the public could normally observe from within the courtroom, where she could control their behaviour. But if they had remote access, she could not control their behaviour and this was not in the “interests of justice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser did not expand on what uncontrolled behaviour she anticipated from those viewing via the internet. It is certainly true that an observer from Amnesty sitting at home might be in their underwear, might be humming the complete soundtrack to Mamma Mia, or might fart loudly. Precisely why this would damage “the interests of justice” we are still left to ponder, with no further help from the magistrate. But evidently the interests of justice were, in her view, best served if almost nobody could examine the “justice” too closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next “housekeeping issue” to be addressed was how witnesses should be heard. The defence had called numerous witnesses, and each had lodged a written statement. The prosecution and Baraitser both suggested that, having given their evidence in writing, there was no need for defence witnesses to give that evidence orally in open court. It would be much quicker to go straight to cross-examination by the prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the defence, Edward Fitzgerald QC countered that justice should be seen to be done by the public. The public should be able to hear the defence evidence before hearing the cross-examination. It would also enable Julian Assange to hear the evidence summarised, which was important for him to follow the case given his lack of extended access to legal papers while in Belmarsh prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser stated there could not be any need for evidence submitted to her in writing to be repeated orally. For the defence, Mark Summers QC was not prepared to drop it and tension notably rose in the court. Summers stated it was normal practice for there to be “an orderly and rational exposition of the evidence”. For the prosecution, James Lewis QC denied this, saying it was not normal procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser stated she could not see why witnesses should be scheduled an one hour forty five minutes each, which was too long. Lewis agreed. He also added that the prosecution does not accept that the defence’s expert witnesses are expert witnesses. A Professor of journalism telling about newspaper coverage did not count. An expert witness should only be giving evidence on a technical point the court was otherwise unqualified to consider. Lewis also objected that in giving evidence orally, defence witnesses might state new facts to which the Crown had not had time to react. Baraitser noted that the written defence statements were published online, so they were available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Fitzgerald QC stood up to speak again, and Baraitser addressed him in a quite extraordinary tone of contempt. What she said exactly was: “I have given you every opportunity. Is there anything else, really, that you want to say”, the word “really” being very heavily emphasised and sarcastic. Fitzgerald refused to be sat down, and he stated that the current case featured “substantial and novel issues going to fundamental questions of human rights.” It was important the evidence was given in public. It also gave the witnesses a chance to emphasise the key points of their evidence and where they placed most weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser called a brief recess while she considered judgement on this issue, and then returned. She found against the defence witnesses giving their evidence in open court, but accepted that each witness should be allowed up to half an hour of being led by the defence lawyers, to enable them to orient themselves and reacquaint with their evidence before cross-examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This half hour for each witness represented something of a compromise, in that at least the basic evidence of each defence witness would be heard by the court and the public (insofar as the public was allowed to hear anything). But the idea that a standard half hour guillotine is sensible for all witnesses, whether they are testifying to a single fact or to developments over years, is plainly absurd. What came over most strongly from this question was the desire of both judge and prosecution to railroad through the extradition with as little of the case against it getting a public airing as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the judge adjourned for a short break we thought these questions had now been addressed and the rest of the day would be calmer. We could not have been more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court resumed with a new defence application, led by Mark Summers QC, about the new charges from the US governments new superseding indictment. Summers took the court back over the history of this extradition hearing. The first indictment had been drawn up in March of 2018. In January 2019 a provisional request for extradition had been made, which had been implemented in April of 2019 on Assange’s removal from the Embassy. In June 2019 this was replaced by the full request with a new, second indictment which had been the basis of these proceedings before today. A whole series of hearings had taken place on the basis of that second indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new superseding indictment dated from 20 June 2020. In February and May 2020 the US government had allowed hearings to go ahead on the basis of the second indictment, giving no warning, even though they must by that stage have known the new superseding indictment was coming. They had given neither explanation nor apology for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defence had not been properly informed of the superseding indictment, and indeed had learnt of its existence only through a US government press release on 20 June. It had not finally been officially served in these proceedings until 29 July, just six weeks ago. At first, it had not been clear how the superseding indictment would affect the charges, as the US government was briefing it made no difference but just gave additional detail. But on 21 August 2020, not before, it finally became clear in new US government submissions that the charges themselves had been changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were now new charges that were standalone and did not depend on the earlier allegations. Even if the 18 Manning related charges were rejected, these new allegations could still form grounds for extradition. These new allegations included encouraging the stealing of data from a bank and from the government of Iceland, passing information on tracking police vehicles, and hacking the computers both of individuals and of a security company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How much of this newly alleged material is criminal is anybody’s guess”, stated Summers, going on to explain that it was not at all clear that an Australian giving advice from outwith Iceland to someone in Iceland on how to crack a code, was actually criminal if it occurred in the UK. This was even without considering the test of dual criminality in the US also, which had to be passed before the conduct was subject to extradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unthinkable that allegations of this magnitude would be the subject of a Part 2 extradition hearing within six weeks if they were submitted as a new case. Plainly that did not give the defence time to prepare, or to line up witnesses to these new charges. Among the issues relating to these new charges the defence would wish to address, were that some were not criminal, some were out of time limitation, some had already been charged in other fora (including Southwark Crown Court and courts in the USA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also important questions to be asked about the origins of some of these charges and the dubious nature of the witnesses. In particular the witness identified as “teenager” was the same person identified as “Iceland 1” in the previous indictment. That indictment had contained a “health warning” over this witness given by the US Department of Justice. This new indictment removed that warning. But the fact was, this witness is Sigurdur Thordarson, who had been convicted in Iceland in relation to these events of fraud, theft, stealing Wikileaks money and material and impersonating Julian Assange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment did not state that the FBI had been “kicked out of Iceland for trying to use Thordarson to frame Assange”, stated Summers baldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers said all these matters should be ventilated in these hearings if the new charges were to be heard, but the defence simply did not have time to prepare its answers or its witnesses in the brief six weeks it had since receiving them, even setting aside the extreme problems of contact with Assange in the conditions in which he was being held in Belmarsh prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defence would plainly need time to prepare answers to these new charges, but it would plainly be unfair to keep Assange in jail for the months that would take. The defence therefore suggested that these new charges should be excised from the conduct to be considered by the court, and they should go ahead with the evidence on criminal behaviour confined to what conduct had previously been alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers argued it was “entirely unfair” to add what were in law new and separate criminal allegations, at short notice and “entirely without warning and not giving the defence time to respond to it. What is happening here is abnormal, unfair and liable to create real injustice if allowed to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arguments submitted by the prosecution now rested on these brand new allegations. For example, the prosecution now countered the arguments on the rights of whistleblowers and the necessity of revealing war crimes by stating that there can have been no such necessity to hack into a bank in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers concluded that the “case should be confined to that conduct which the American government had seen fit to allege in the eighteen months of the case” before their second new indictment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replying to Summers for the prosecution, Joel Smith QC replied that the judge was obliged by the statute to consider the new charges and could not excise them. “If there is nothing proper about the restitution of a new extradition request after a failed request, there is nothing improper in a superseding indictment before the first request had failed.” Under the Extradition Act the court must decide only if the offence is an extraditable offence and the conduct alleged meets the dual criminality test. The court has no other role and no jurisdiction to excise part of the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith stated that all the authorities (precedents) were of charges being excised from a case to allow extradition to go ahead on the basis of the remaining sound charges, and those charges which had been excised were only on the basis of double jeopardy. There was no example of charges being excised to prevent an extradition. And the decision to excise charges had only ever been taken after the conduct alleged had been examined by the court. There was no example of alleged conduct not being considered by the court. The defendant could seek extra time if needed but the new allegations must be examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers replied that Smith was “wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong”. “We are not saying that you can never submit a new indictment, but you cannot do it six weeks before the substantive hearing.” The impact of what Smith had said amounted to no more than “Ha ha this is what we are doing and you can’t stop us.” A substantive last minute change had been made with no explanation and no apology. It could not be the case, as Smith alleged, that a power existed to excise charges in fairness to the prosecution, but no power existed to excise charges in fairness to the defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately Summers sat down, Baraitser gave her judgement on this point. As so often in this hearing, it was a pre-written judgement. She read it from a laptop she had brought into the courtroom with her, and she had made no alterations to that document as Summers and Smith had argued the case in front of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser stated that she had been asked as a preliminary move to excise from the case certain conduct alleged. Mr Summers had described the receipt of new allegations as extraordinary. However “I offered the defence the opportunity to adjourn the case” to give them time to prepare against the new allegations. “I considered of course that Mr Assange was in custody. I hear that Mr Summers believes this is fundamental unfairness”. But “the argument that we haven’t got the time, should be remedied by asking for the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Summers had raised issues of dual criminality and abuse of process; there was nothing preventing him for raising these arguments in the context of considering the request as now presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser simply ignored the argument that while there was indeed “nothing to prevent” the defence from answering the new allegations as each was considered, they had been given no time adequately to prepare. Having read out her pre-prepared judgement to proceed on the basis of the new superseding indictment, Baraitser adjourned the court for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day I had the opportunity to speak to an extremely distinguished and well-known lawyer on the subject of Baraitser bringing pre-written judgements into court, prepared before she had heard the lawyers argue the case before her. I understood she already had seen the outline written arguments, but surely this was wrong. What was the point in the lawyers arguing for hours if the judgement was pre-written? What I really wanted to know was how far this was normal practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer replied to me that it absolutely was not normal practice, it was totally outrageous. In a long and distinguished career, this lawyer had very occasionally seen it done, even in the High Court, but there was always some effort to disguise the fact, perhaps by inserting some reference to points made orally in the courtroom. Baraitser was just blatant. The question was, of course, whether it was her own pre-written judgement she was reading out, or something she had been given from on high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty shocking morning. The guillotining of defence witnesses to hustle the case through, indeed the attempt to ensure their evidence was not spoken in court except those parts which the prosecution saw fit to attack in cross-examination, had been breathtaking. The effort by the defence to excise the last minute superseding indictment had been a fundamental point disposed of summarily. Yet again, Baraitser’s demeanour and very language made little attempt to disguise a hostility to the defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were for the second time in the day in a break thinking that events must now calm down and get less dramatic. Again we were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court resumed forty minutes late after lunch as various procedural wrangles were addressed behind closed doors. As the court resumed, Mark Summers for the defence stood up with a bombshell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers said that the defence “recognised” the judgement Baraitser had just made – a very careful choice of word, as opposed to “respected” which might seem more natural. As she had ruled that the remedy to lack of time was more time, the defence was applying for an adjournment to enable them to prepare the answers to the new charges. They did not do this lightly, as Mr Assange would continue in prison in very difficult conditions during the adjournment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers said the defence was simply not in a position to gather the evidence to respond to the new charges in a few short weeks, a situation made even worse by Covid restrictions. It was true that on 14 August Baraitser had offered an adjournment and on 21 August they had refused the offer. But in that period of time, Mr Assange had not had access to the new charges and they had not fully realised the extent to which these were a standalone new case. To this date, Assange had still not received the new prosecution Opening Note in prison, which was a crucial document in setting out the significance of the new charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser pointedly asked whether the defence could speak to Assange in prison by telephone. Summers replied yes, but these were extremely short conversations. They could not phone Mr Assange; he could only call out very briefly on the prison payphone to somebody’s mobile, and the rest of the team would have to try to gather round to listen. It was not possible in these very brief discussions adequately to expound complex material. Between 14 and 21 August they had been able to have only two such very short phone calls. The defence could only send documents to Mr Assange through the post to the prison; he was not always given them, or allowed to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser asked how long an adjournment was being requested. Summers replied until January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the US government, Mark Lewis QC replied that more scrutiny was needed of this request. The new matters in the indictment were purely criminal. They do not affect the arguments about the political nature of the case, or affect most of the witnesses. If more time were granted, “with the history of this case, we will just be presented with a sleigh of other material which will have no bearing on the small expansion of count 2”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser adjourned the court “for ten minutes” while she went out to consider her judgement. In fact she took much longer. When she returned she looked peculiarly strained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baraitser ruled that on 14 August she had given the defence the opportunity to apply for an adjournment, and given them seven days to decide. On 21 August the defence had replied they did not want an adjournment. They had not replied that they had insufficient time to consider. Even today the defence had not applied to adjourn but rather had applied to excise charges. They “cannot have been surprised by my decision” against that application. Therefore they must have been prepared to proceed with the hearing. Their objections were not based on new circumstance. The conditions of Assange in Belmarsh had not changed since 21 August. They had therefore missed their chance and the motion to adjourn was refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courtroom atmosphere was now highly charged. Having in the morning refused to cut out the superseding indictment on the grounds that the remedy for lack of time should be more time, Baraitser was now refusing to give more time. The defence had called her bluff; the state had apparently been confident that the effective solitary confinement in Belmarsh was so terrible that Assange would not request more time. I rather suspect that Julian was himself bluffing, and made the call at lunchtime to request more time in the full expectation that it would be refused, and the rank hypocrisy of the proceedings exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2020/07/damage-to-the-soul/&quot;&gt;previously blogged&lt;/a&gt; about how the procedural trickery of the superseding indictment being used to replace the failing second indictment – as Smith said for the prosecution “before it failed” – was something that sickened the soul. Today in the courtroom you could smell the sulphur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yet again we were left with the feeling that matters must now get less exciting. This time we were right and they became instead excruciatingly banal. We finally moved on to the first witness, Professor Mark Feldstein, giving evidence to the court by videolink for the USA. It was not Professor Feldstein’s fault the day finished in confused anti-climax. The court was unable to make the video technology work. For ten broken minutes out of about forty Feldstein was briefly able to give evidence, and even this was completely unsatisfactory as he and Mark Summers were repeatedly speaking over each other on the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Feldstein’s evidence will resume tomorrow (now in fact today) and I think rather than split it I shall give the full account then. Meantime you can see these excellent summaries from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kgosztola/status/1302888230115737600&quot;&gt;Kevin Gosztola&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://assangecourt.report/september-7-morning&quot;&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://assangecourt.report/september-7-afternoon&quot;&gt;afternoon&lt;/a&gt; reports from James Doleman. In fact, I should be grateful if you did, so you can see that I am neither inventing nor exaggerating the facts of these startling events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you asked me to sum up today in a word, that word would undoubtedly be “railroaded”. it was all about pushing through the hearing as quickly as possible and with as little public exposure as possible to what is happening. Access denied, adjournment denied, exposition of defence evidence denied, removal of superseding indictment charges denied. The prosecution was plainly failing in that week back in Woolwich in February, which seems like an age ago. It has now been given a new boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the defence will deal with the new charges we shall see. It seems impossible that they can do this without calling new witnesses to address the new facts. But the witness lists had already been finalised on the basis of the old charges. That the defence should be forced to proceed with the wrong witnesses seems crazy, but frankly, I am well past being surprised by anything in this fake process.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Your Man in the Public Gallery: the Assange Hearing Day 6 - Craig Murray</og:title>
<og:description>I went to the Old Bailey today expecting to be awed by the majesty of the law, and left revolted by the sordid administration of injustice.

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When linking to a page for the &lt;strong&gt;purpose of reference&lt;/strong&gt;, it seems better to me to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;link to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; of a given page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, rather than to the original site itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that after some years have gone by, &lt;strong&gt;my article is guaranteed to be consistent&lt;/strong&gt;. Due the changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one&quot;&gt;If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability&quot;&gt;In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On finally learning to program at the age of 40</title>
<link>https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/blob/master/README.md</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/blob/master/README.md</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This year I finally learned to program at the age of 40, after failure after failure despite having taken to computers like a duck to water and being seemingly destined to enter IT as far back as elementary school. Maybe it'll be of some use to you to show that it's never too late, or that sometimes you just need to find the right language to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming for me started back in the 1980s with our first computer. It was an odd beast called an ADAM Computer, and looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/blob/master/Coleco_Adam_(adjusted_version).jpg#thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/raw/master/Coleco_Adam_(adjusted_version).jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco_Adam#/media/File:Coleco_Adam_(adjusted_version).jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Andrew Lih&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a sort of hybrid of personal computer, COLECOVISION gaming system, and a typewriter. The computer itself is as you can see in the image, with two tape drives in place of a disk drive or cartridge, an actual TV instead of a monitor, and an interesting printer that had a switch on it that let you turn it into a full-blown typewriter. A lot of other ADAM computer users had actual disk drives but we didn't, and the tapes took forever to load. They would make this sound for about a minute or two: rrr rrr rrr REEE, rrr rrr rrr REEE, rrr rrr rrr REE, rrr rrr rrr (repeat). rrr is the slow moving forward sound while REEE was a quick rewind, so it must have been reading forward while then needing to move back to the next block that was located behind it. (Feel free to tell me more &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mithridates&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/user/Dhghomon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; if you know more about how these drives worked - I'm still curious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember my dad doing a lot of tape recording in the basement when we first got it, but wasn't sure why it resulted in getting so many games out of it. (My favourite was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_to_Apshai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gateway to Apshai&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of Roguelike game. I asked him about it a few months ago, and it turned out that he used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Forth&lt;/a&gt; to make it happen. Here's what he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Forth a bit when we had the Coleco Adam computer which had a Zilog Z80 CPU. Not sure if you remember but I ordered a tape from the U.S. (for the tape drive) that came with several hacker programs and a manual called The Hackers Guide to the Adam which allowed us to download ColecoVision cartridge games to blank tapes so we got a ton of games. I didn't write any programs myself but the programs on the tape came with the source code so you could follow the logic. In some cases I needed to tweak the parameters and re-save in order to optimize whatever needed to be hacked. It was interesting and fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key point is that he showed me something called BASIC that at the time I assumed was the only programming language in the world. I took to it and followed along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/the-mystery-of-silver-mountain/mode/2up&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;books like this one called the Mystery of Silver Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hunt the Wumpus&lt;/a&gt;, and pretty soon had picked up how to program. I began making my own small RPGs based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson%27s_Sorcery!&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Steve Jackson's Sorcery! books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ended up like a larger version of this code below copied from Wikipedia with a lot of &lt;code&gt;RAND&lt;/code&gt; for the dice rolls and &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt; calls. I remember having to add finer and finer line numbers as time went on (adding a line 65 in between 60 and 70, then a line 67, finally renumbering the whole thing when I ran out of room) and somehow managing to play a musical score at the beginning of the game along with a single line drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;basic&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;10 INPUT &quot;What is your name: &quot;; U$
20 PRINT &quot;Hello &quot;; U$
30 INPUT &quot;How many stars do you want: &quot;; N
40 S$ = &quot;&quot;
50 FOR I = 1 TO N
60 S$ = S$ + &quot;*&quot;
70 NEXT I
80 PRINT S$
90 INPUT &quot;Do you want more stars? &quot;; A$
100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90
110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)
120 IF A$ = &quot;Y&quot; OR A$ = &quot;y&quot; THEN GOTO 30
130 PRINT &quot;Goodbye &quot;; U$
140 END
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this I had done all on my own in an era well before being able to search for sample code online, and by all accounts it looked like I was destined to work in IT. Meanwhile, at school we were being taught to use something called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Logo&lt;/a&gt;. This was way less fun, and involved pretty much just making a turtle draw shapes on the screen. You would give it functions like &lt;code&gt;FD 90, RT 90&lt;/code&gt; and then make it do that four times with &lt;code&gt;REPEAT 4&lt;/code&gt; and it would draw a square. Drawing a circle took forever because you would have to do &lt;code&gt;REPEAT 360&lt;/code&gt; to make it happen, and you'd have to watch the turtle do 360 operations just to make a circle. So sometimes you'd cheat a bit and do &lt;code&gt;REPEAT 180&lt;/code&gt; and make the turtle move right 2 degrees at a time so the computer would end up drawing pretty much the same thing but only have to make 180 calculations instead of 360.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then for extra fanciness you can make shapes like the one below where you tell it to do a circle, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; tell it to turn right a bit and then start the next circle. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the funny thing about this Logo experience is that I had almost completely forgotten it until I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LjFM8vw3pbU?t=246&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this video by Bryan Cantrill&lt;/a&gt; who is about my age and also had an early childhood experience with it. For him it was the same: he remembered feeling complete apathy about the whole thing and trying to make this turtle draw. Fortunately for him, he ended up encountering C and getting really drawn into programming. I didn't, but it was my own doing. Here's how it went with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in computer class in the 1980s we would all sit inside a windowless room in Ranchlands Community School in Calgary at our computers and make the turtles do stuff. Being super easy to use, it actually didn't even feel like a programming language to me and a few others who found it easy. The teachers noticed this and told us that there was a Logo competition coming up soon and that we should take part. Memory of the competition is a bit vague but I think it was citywide, or maybe a provincial competition, so that meant the odd experience of seeing kids from other schools in the same room as you. It's always weird as a child to encounter kids from other schools as you try to sum them up and make sense of who are the cool kids, who aren't, and what their school vibe is like. So a few of us from our school went, we got into teams, and were supposed to put something together that impressed the judges. It went on for two or three days where we would do some work there at the competition, do some more at home, and finally have a product for the last day that gets judged and hopefully wins a prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was where the apathy began to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sink in. My teammate was a lot more into the competition than I was, and my lack of interest was starting to show. Eventually we put something together that I think got in 4th or 5th place, which he was unsatisfied with. I felt relief though as by the time the competition ended I knew that this world of programming was something I wanted absolutely &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with, and I didn't want to win and be sent to some other competition as a star Logo programmer. Back then just being good at computers = nerd, and my life's goal at the time was to get the girl I had a crush on throughout elementary to like me back. So even up to then I had been keeping a distance from computers when out in public so that I could maintain the image of &quot;Yeah, I'm good at computers but I'm not a &lt;em&gt;computer guy&lt;/em&gt; or anything&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after the two or three days of watching the Logo-proficient and what they had put together, we got a t-shirt and a bottle (I think) for participating, and that was the last I ever did anything with it. Meanwhile BASIC continued for a while until we switched the ADAM computer out for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;386&lt;/a&gt; one day in the early 90s and I forgot all about it. The problem was that there was no internet to quickly search for code samples, and I wasn't about to actually go and spend money on a book about programming that for all I knew would take me back into that world of competitions and (I was sure of it) probably rejection from the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, here's the line from the Bryan Cantrill video above that brought it all back. His first experience with Logo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reflecting on all the languages and I guess the first language I ever used was Logo, which in hindsight was kind of child abuse. Logo is awful. And if you read the Wikipedia page for Logo now, you'd be like &quot;Well, this is fine. It's like a Lisp dialect that influenced-&quot; It's like no, no, that's all wrong. Logo was a turtle that didn't know how to do anything, and by turtle I mean like a triangle on a CRT that couldn't do anything. And the magic of it was like you would tell it to &quot;box&quot; and it would tell you &quot;I don't know how to box&quot;. And I remember, like, I was in third grade in the kind of mandatory computing class as was kind of, of my vintage. And I remember feeling - for someone who wasn't necessarily prone to this - but feeling overwhelmed with apathy that this thing didn't know how to box. Didn't know how to like, make a box. Like, I don't care that you don't know how to make a box. I don't think it cared that it didn't know how to make a box...and then you would tell it, you'd be like &quot;no, you make a box by going, you know, forward 5, rotate 90, forward 5, rotate 90, forward 5, rotate, 90...&quot; and then you would like tell it that that's how you &quot;box&quot;...these kind of four steps. And then you could like type &quot;box&quot; and it would make a box. And I still didn't care, and I don't think it cared. Like, my first exposure to computing was like just like one of total &quot;I do not give a shit at all about this thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: just received input from my mom about what she remembers of the room where we learned Logo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. A small, cramped windowless room. 10 students at a time? Uninspired beginning to learn about computers I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it was the room that I liked most about Logo class: the dark windowless room was filled with &lt;em&gt;computers&lt;/em&gt;, which felt futuristic as hell at the time. You would walk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@51.1184352,-114.1787332,3a,34.3y,281.04h,93.62t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sVLFZfvR9gzLrvbdzFYkexQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;into the side door of the school&lt;/a&gt;, take a quick right and then find yourself in another world composed of a single dark room with whirring computers on three sides. That's why it was more the pity that they were used for Logo and Logo only. Now back to the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the period from the 90s to the 2000s involved no programming whatsoever. Two things did happen during this period, however, that proved to be crucial: I became a huge fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and of Ultima 7. As Data was my favourite character, I would often ponder how Dr. Soong might have put him together, and how long it would take for us to reach that stage. As for Ultima 7, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisguincreations.com/the-drawing-board/16dqd44vpx1eae5tqw17p81itqblwi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;read this post&lt;/a&gt;. The post sums up how I felt about it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultima VII was perhaps the first game I ever played where it seemed clear that the world did not exist merely to serve me as a game player. The store owners did NOT keep their stores open 24 hours a day for my benefit. If they were at dinner or asleep, I was out of luck. If I invaded someone's house, they yelled at me. If I broke all their jars and looted the (mostly useless) stuff inside of them, the jars did not respawn when I left the house and came back in - they were broken for the rest of the game. It felt real in a strange way. Goofy as it may sound, it's like there was a world I was visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/blob/master/Ultima_7.jpg#thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/raw/master/Ultima_7.jpg#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;Ultima 7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had and still do have the same feel when I play Ultima 7: the world is so packed with detail that I'll play it even now just to go talk to people, visit bars and watch the people read the numerous books, and just walk around the world and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this period was crucial to making me interested in programming again. Programming wasn't about turtles and depressing competitions anymore, but could be about science fiction, movies, fantasy games, music, and everything else I considered to be cool and worthwhile in life. I knew by then that there was a language called C++ that was used to make games, and maybe it could let me make an android like Data and games like Ultima 7 one day, but I had no connection to programming anymore and the internet still wasn't a thing. That gave me a certain (okay, a lot of) veneration for C++ but I had nowhere to go from there, and my main interests were elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I moved from Canada to Japan, then Korea, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pagef30.com/2013/02/how-i-learned-korean.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;where I learned that language too&lt;/a&gt; and continue to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I met a Korean-Canadian guy from Toronto who was working in Korea as a programmer, which piqued my curiosity. As an ethnic Korean he was able to work freelance without needing a strict employer to allow him to keep his visa, and would just sit at Starbucks all day and program in two languages that he said were called PHP and Python. I knew the name PHP, but thought it was just the name of a bulletin board thanks to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.eslcafe.com/korea/viewforum.php?f=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expat bulletin board&lt;/a&gt; that was popular at the time and built in PHP 3 (and still is!!!!). He told me that I should give them a try since I pick up new skills quickly and it would only help my career. He said that he recommended Python out of the two, and that I should start out with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first experience with Python was more or less utter confusion with only a few small successes. I remember reading threads about Python 2 vs. 3 and how 2 was so much better and that 3 was being forced down everyone's throat. Whatever that means. I noticed some familiar things like &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; but the familiar &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; was nowhere to be seen, and there weren't any line numbers or &lt;code&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt;. I managed to put some things together without a main function, but didn't really know how a program went from start to finish without line numbers and other such helpful things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, by then the internet was useful enough that it was easy to find discussion after discussion of the benefits of one language vs. another. I noticed that there was another language called Ruby that seemed more like my style, so I gave it a try for a bit. Then I saw that there was another one called Lua that felt like maybe it was made for me. I couldn't figure out how to install or use it, but I was kind of convinced for who knows what reason (syntax I think, or had read somewhere that it was easy) that Lua was what I wanted. I had some vague idea that this was the easiest programming language one could learn and if I just learned that well I could just sort of pick up all the others later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later I met the same friend at a Starbucks and he asked me how Python was going. I told him about how I felt like Lua was the language for me, without giving any real reason why, and clearly hadn't grasped how to code yet. He eventually commented that &quot;Eh, maybe it's just not in your genes.&quot; I insisted that it was, somehow. How could it not be? I learned BASIC by myself when I was in elementary, I knew I had the genes. I just had to get really into Lua and learn it well...or should I learn Javascript? People are saying you should learn that first...no, Python. Although I do like Ruby better...shouldn't I just learn that and I'll pretty much know Python by the end anyway? And on and on it went until I lost interest again. I did eventually learn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pagef30.com/2010/04/creating-necessary-and-useful-content.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;how to take user input in Python and use it to return results&lt;/a&gt;, but if I remember correctly I don't think I used a single external function to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up living in Canada again for a few years, and programming was nowhere on the radar. I was at a company called TransCanada Pipelines where becoming a good project controller (or similar position) was key for the employees in our group. The only programming-related event during this period (2011 to 2015) was one time when we were implementing SAP and we heard that there were all these C++ guys in the other building. They were contractors that were there to customize SAP for pipeline and other energy projects, and were getting paid gobs and gobs of cash doing it. This was during the era in Calgary when there was so many projects that you more or less couldn't get people out of bed for less than $100. Summer students napped at their desks and still didn't get let go because even the little bit of help they provided was better than nothing...but eventually that era ended too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices crashed in 2015, so did the Calgary economy, and our entire team was let go. With a nice layoff package I decided that this was the time to really learn to code. During this time in Canada (2011 to 2018) all I wanted to do was return to Korea, and I considered either finishing university or learning to code, and decided that the latter was the way to go. Maybe I could get really good at it and get a position in Korea that allowed for a proper visa this time. It actually turned out that finishing university was the right choice (and that's how I did end up back here), but in the meantime in 2015 I opted for this instead of university, and finally got a feel for what Python was. I picked up how to write functions, how to make objects, etc. but the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; keyword was still confusing and so was using objects. A bit more effort would have sufficed to get over that, but just then the old wanderlust struck again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Python's horrible for making games - this won't let you make anything like Ultima 7.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Why not try out C++? No, that's too hard. How about C#? Let's try that.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Wow, this is pretty complicated. Still, looks like C# is the way to go! Wait, what's this? F#? This language is really cool. Why aren't all languages like this?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;F# is awesome! Why aren't more people using it though? Maybe I should finish properly learning Python...&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;So Python it is, nice and easy! Unless it's Javascript. Then I can do anything in just a browser. Maybe start with some browser-based games? Time to give that a try...&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the layoff package money started to dry up and it was time to find work again. Upon getting another job, I went downtown one day to celebrate with the former coworkers. Across the room at the coffee shop somebody called out my name - it was an old friend that I hadn't seen since the mid-90s. He was working in finance and asked me what I was doing downtown in Calgary, and I told him that I had gotten a new job that started the next week. &quot;Oh, I bet it's programming! You were always so good at that.&quot; he said. I replied, &quot;Oh, not programming...I haven't really done any of that for a long time. It's in project controls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job in project controls was fine, of course. But I remember this conversation well because once again it got me thinking about why I had never learned to code when by any measure I seemed destined for it when I was young. I was too busy with other things though to give programming another try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished university, returned to Korea in 2018, and in August the next year gave my notice as a copywriter at the company I was working at the time. With a month left until my last day, I started to think about picking up another skill - maybe &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; learning Python this time. I could put in a few hours a day, get pretty good by my last day, and then spend a month or so binging on it before it was time to find work again. So I did that for a few days...and the wanderlust struck again. &quot;Fine, you can look at other languages a little,&quot; I said, &quot;but you have to keep Python as your focus. Just an hour or so a day and Python for the rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when I gave Rust a try for the first time. I had read a bit about it and heard that apparently it was really precise and tough to learn, but that people who loved it swore by it. More importantly, it was very performant. It looked like a nice tough language to take a quick look at before quickly fleeing back to the safety of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with Rust on &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/rust/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;learn x in y minutes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.rust-lang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rust playground&lt;/a&gt;. Curly braces to capture variables to print was the same as Python, but a lot of it looked like the C# that I had tried out a bit before. As I started to learn it I checked to see what you could do with this language, and the answer was invariably &lt;em&gt;pretty much anything&lt;/em&gt;. So I could make something like Ultima 7, or anything I wanted. But what was even more interesting was how the detail and the low-levelness of the language did nothing to turn me off: I found myself drawn in even more. It's probably the time spent growing up in the 80s that has something to do with it as I felt a lot of nostalgia as I got more and more into the language. Everything I wrote was turned straight into a binary and I could see the computer's internals again. Tons of Rust discussions were about how to optimize code, and I found this fascinating. But at the same time this language was high-level and safe enough that I didn't need to worry about shooting my foot off, so to speak. It felt like a language that, if I devoted myself fully to it, could make almost anything possible (at least as far as a single language can do this) - and that's why the wanderlust completely disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knew that this sort of code would do the trick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/blob/master/Rust_love.png#thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Dhghomon/programming_at_40/raw/master/Rust_love.png#thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Programming Rust&lt;/a&gt; was too much for me on first reading (too many references to C++ and C for one), so I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Rust Book&lt;/a&gt; and then came back to it, and ended up enjoying it the most. What helped the most though was binging on videos of live coding streams. The first one was the 70 or so videos by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRDqvQqWAuE&amp;amp;list=PLrmY5pVcnuE_dyWibakRuGJcuiwAkhGZB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brooks Builds&lt;/a&gt;, a Javascript developer who recorded himself going through the Rust Book every step of the way. There's something about watching someone struggle through a language that you are learning too that makes you mentally participate in a way that other types of streams can't do. I had the same experience with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF3lNEjv7avTzYQwXU4DssdwRvG35O7Ei&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lernen to Talk Show&lt;/a&gt; in German by a guy who recorded himself every week in Germany as he learned the language and got better every video. Watching the person struggle when you know the answer is probably the part that brings you in the most. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8BnZAXFAiHg?t=231&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;It's mit einer deutschen Familie, not mit einem deutsche Familie!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; or &quot;Just use into_iter() and it'll compile!&quot; are the moments where you feel like you're really learning alongside someone else (and in fact you are) and this can't be replicated by someone who has already learned the language and is already typing or chatting merrily away without a single error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I started watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/bcmyers05&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brian Myers&lt;/a&gt; who also learned Rust basically by binging. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iD0xppBwwsrM9DegC5cQQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jon Gjengset&lt;/a&gt; I was saving for last (this was before he started Crust of Rust to teach simpler things) and in the meantime also watched all of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ_EWaQZCZuGGfnuqUoHujw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hello Rust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpeX4D-ArTrsqvhLapAHprQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ryan Levick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az3jBd4xdF4&amp;amp;list=PLLqEtX6ql2EyPAZ1M2_C0GgVd4A-_L4_5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Doug Milford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYqceb2AnkU&amp;amp;list=PLJbE2Yu2zumDF6BX6_RdPisRVHgzV02NW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tensor Programming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF34dRivLOw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this Rust crash course&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOMJlQ5B-M0&amp;amp;list=PLVvjrrRCBy2JSHf9tGxGKJ-bYAN_uDCUL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Rust videos by dcode, etc.&lt;/a&gt; (not all in that order) One other stream I enjoy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/rhymu8354/videos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rhymu8354&lt;/a&gt; who is a 25+ year C++ guy who has made his own Ultima 5-ish game and started Rust recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after about six months of that I found that I had properly learned to program for the first time in my life. There was no secret to it: it really was just the single focus and the binging that did it. Having only a Surface Go, I made sure to steer clear of anything with too many external crates but I made some things like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc1UvlBnKRw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hanja converter&lt;/a&gt; (hanja = Chinese characters as used in Korea) that worked just great, and eventually I put together a textbook called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Dhghomon/easy_rust/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;learn Rust with easy English&lt;/a&gt; in order to make the language easy to learn for English L2 speakers without a translation of the Rust Book in their own language, or just people who want a plain introduction to the language. I just finished that book last week. I have yet to put together anything earthshakingly impressive in Rust but at least when someone else does I can read along and follow what they did! It's incredibly satisfying to take something so unfamiliar and make it familiar after a lot of hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story I guess is just the classic &quot;find something you like and keep doing it&quot;. This wasn't new to me (I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to find something I liked), it just took me that long to find the language that fit. And the other nice thing is that it has made other languages so readable and approachable, even C and C++ (well, only kind of for C++), which I read for the first time a month or two ago. It's also &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; weird (also fun) to look at something like Python again that just works without any of the specifics that you use in Rust. It feels like everything is generics but no traits, while you need to give the right input to avoid problems down the line. Meanwhile, Rust's compiler works more along these lines: &quot;No, that's wrong. No, those are two different types. Try dereferencing. You didn't declare that mutable yet. You gave that value to another variable so you don't own it anymore. That reference might not live long enough, try again. You didn't tell me what to do with all the possible variants of the enum.&quot; until it finally works - but once it compiles, you have something that is more or less already debugged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anybody else, I hope this will show that 1) wanderlust and lack of focus isn't necessarily forever, and 2) depending on your personality type, maybe the easiest language isn't necessarily the one that you will take most strongly too. It brings to mind the discussions on places like &lt;a href=&quot;http://old.reddit.com/r/languagelearning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;/r/languagelearning on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; inevitably started by someone who &quot;really wants to learn (famously Language X) but should I just keep up with the easier Spanish/French/etc. even though I hate it and really just want to learn Language X?&quot; The answer there is always of course not - just learn the language you want to learn. I imagine that this advice is easier to give for something like natural languages that are not so tightly tied to a career path as programming languages are, but since programming languages have a lot of carryover as well, maybe the same advice could work here too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, I'm not sure. I'm already gainfully employed doing other things unrelated to Rust, and the only career I can see with it at the moment considering my background and where I live is helping companies over here implement it. It's certainly not the type of language that you learn in order to be a junior programmer in a big team, much less at the age of 40. But if you're the type of person for whom the skill of programming itself has proven elusive time and time again, maybe finding the right one, regardless of which one it is and how useful it is, could do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
