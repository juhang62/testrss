<title>Tesla Posts Big Quarterly Loss as Its Electric-Car Sales Lag</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla’s surprisingly weak &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fneal-e.-boudette&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;electric-car deliveries&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter took a heavy toll on its bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/b2218d34-fbee-4f1f-ac95-050eb29dd42f&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it lost $702 million in the first quarter, a sharp reversal from the profits it made in the second half of last year. The loss, equivalent to $4.10 per share, was far greater than the $1.81 per share that Wall Street analysts, surveyed by FactSet, had forecast. The quarter’s revenue of $4.54 billion fell well short of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla had $2.2 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter, a 40 percent decline from the figure at the end of last year. The company spent $920 million paying off a bond in March. Tesla’s operations consumed $640 million of cash in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Investors had been bracing for the red ink after Tesla said it sold 31 percent fewer vehicles in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company said logistical challenges had hindered deliveries of the Model 3 sedan to Europe and China. A reduction in a federal tax benefit for Tesla’s buyers may have weighed on Model 3 sales in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Another weak spot for the company was its solar business, where sales dropped by more than 35 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We expected weak results, but Tesla’s revenue and profit misses were stunning,” Vicki Bryan, chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said in an email. “Revenue was soft, but spiking costs for obvious strategy missteps really drew blood at the bottom line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The big question for Tesla is whether the drop in car sales in the first quarter was a temporary phenomenon or something more serious. Sales of Model 3 sedans could recover as the company delivers cars overseas. But demand for the higher-priced Model S and Model X vehicles plunged 56 percent in the first quarter from the fourth, even though the company cut the price of the cars at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla said on Wednesday that the reduction in the tax credit might have weakened demand for the Model X and the Model S. The company added that after the price cut, the increase in orders for high-end versions of those models exceeded the available supply. Tesla is also hoping that buyers flock to new versions of the S and X that can travel farther on a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an investor call after the results were announced, a stock analyst asked why Tesla was cutting prices if demand was strong for its products. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, responded that the goal was to make its cars “as affordable as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Analysts had slashed their earnings estimates in recent weeks, and after the anemic delivery numbers, Tesla again faces doubts that it can achieve its goals and meet Wall Street’s financial targets. Its stock was little changed in extended trading after the earnings announcement, but it is down over 30 percent from its most recent high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla said Wednesday that it expected to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 cars in the second quarter, up from 63,000 in the first three months of the year. It said it would lose money again in the second quarter, though less than in the first quarter, and would turn a profit in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla’s supporters are hoping that Model 3 sales will surge and enable the company to meet its target of delivering 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year. Tesla affirmed that goal on Wednesday, but said its vehicle production would be “significantly higher than deliveries,” because of the time it takes to transport cars from California to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company is now offering a $35,000 version of Model 3. The lower price may stir up demand for the car, but charging less could make it harder for Tesla to make a profit on the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tesla’s cash position is crucial to the company’s future. Mr. Musk intends to produce new vehicles in volume, including a large truck called the Semi, but setting up the new production facilities would consume large amounts of cash. Many analysts expect that Tesla will have to issue new shares to raise money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Musk, who had previously said the company did not need more capital, indicated that he had changed his mind because Tesla was now in a position to use capital more efficiently. “There is merit to the idea of raising capital at this point,” he told analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Massachusetts Court Blocks Warrantless Access to Real-Time Location Data</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/massachusetts-court-blocks-warrantless-access-real-time-cell-phone-location-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/04/massachusetts-court-blocks-warrantless-access-real-time-cell-phone-location-data</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There's heartening news for our location privacy out of Massachusetts this week. The Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest court, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/commonwealth-v-almonor-massachusetts-supreme-judicial-court-opinion&quot;&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that police access to real-time cell phone location data—whether it comes from a phone company or from technology like a cell site simulator—intrudes on a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy. Absent exigent circumstances, the court held, the police must get a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/commonwealth-v-almonor-massachusetts-supreme-judicial-court-opinion&quot;&gt;Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Almonor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, police had a phone carrier “ping” the cell phone of a suspect in a murder case—surreptitiously accessing GPS functions and causing the phone to send its coordinates back to the phone carrier and the police. This real-time location data pinpointed Mr. Almonor’s phone to a location inside a private home. The state argued it could warrantlessly get cell phone location data to find anyone, anytime, at any place as long as it was less than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/massachusetts-court-rules-cell-tracking-requires-warrant&quot;&gt;six hours&lt;/a&gt; old. A trial court disagreed and the state appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFF filed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/almonor-amicus-brief-eff-aclu&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; in this case in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclum.org/&quot;&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://macdl.com/&quot;&gt;Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers&lt;/a&gt;. We asked the court to recognize, as the Supreme Court did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/victory-supreme-court-says-fourth-amendment-applies-cell-phone-tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. v Carpenter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; that people have a constitutional right to privacy in their physical movements. We argued that, because people have their phones with them all the time, and because the location information produced by the phone can reveal our every move—where and with whom we live, socialize, visit, vacation, worship, and much more—the police must get a warrant to access this sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts court held that “[m]anipulating our phones for the purpose of identifying and tracking our personal location presents an even greater intrusion” than accessing the historical location data at issue in &lt;em&gt;Carpenter.&lt;/em&gt; It concluded that “by causing the defendant's cell phone to reveal its real-time location, the Commonwealth intruded on the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy in the real-time location of his cell phone.” The court recognized both that cell phone use is ubiquitous in our society, and that a phone’s location is a “proxy” for its owner’s location. The court noted that “society's expectation has been that law enforcement could not secretly and instantly identify a person's real-time physical location at will,” and “[a]llowing law enforcement to immediately locate an individual whose whereabouts were previously unknown by compelling that individual's cell phone to reveal its location contravenes that expectation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the majority’s opinion focuses on the fact that, in this case, law enforcement directed the phone company to “manipulate” the defendant’s phone, causing it to send its location to the phone company. In other words, the phone company wouldn’t have collected the data on its own as part of its normal business practices. But two judges, in a concurring opinion, expressed concern that this focus on law enforcement action—rather than on the collection of location data alone—would result in an exception for searches of real-time location data that providers collect automatically. The concurring justices would hold that the Massachusetts constitution “protects us from pings not because of the right to keep the government from interfering with our cellular telephones, but because of the right to keep the government from finding us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very concerning because, as the concurring justices note, the majority’s focus on government action here could allow the police to “side-step the constitutional protection” by just asking for the data the cell service provider collects on its own. Although the majority denied that would happen, it remains to be seen, both how officers will implement searches after this opinion and how lower courts will apply constitutional law to those searches. We’ve seen the Commonwealth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/09/massachusetts-court-rules-cell-tracking-requires-warrant&quot;&gt;interpret this court’s prior decisions on location tracking&lt;/a&gt; very narrowly in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the defendant raised both federal and state constitutional claims in &lt;em&gt;Almonor&lt;/em&gt;, the court based its decision solely on Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which was drafted before—and served as one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mass.gov/guides/john-adams-the-massachusetts-constitution&quot;&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; for—our federal Bill of Rights. Article 14, one of the cornerstones of the Massachusetts Constitution, is the state’s equivalent to the Fourth Amendment. As the court notes, it “does, or may, afford more substantive protection to individuals than that which prevails under the Constitution of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courts around the country are now being asked to address the scope of the &lt;em&gt;Carpenter&lt;/em&gt; ruling. &lt;em&gt;Almonor&lt;/em&gt; in Massachusetts and a case called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/odonnell-amicus-brief-eff-aclu&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;State of Maine v. O’Donnell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; in Maine are among the first to deal directly with how &lt;em&gt;Carpenter&lt;/em&gt; should be applied when police track and locate people in real-time. We’re heartened that the Massachusetts court took these issues seriously and made clear that the police must get a warrant, whether they access &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/massachusetts-requires-warrants-cell-tracking&quot;&gt;historical cell phone location data&lt;/a&gt; or whether they cause a phone to send its real-time location. We’re still waiting for the Maine court’s opinion in &lt;em&gt;O’Donnell,&lt;/em&gt; and we’re actively tracking other cases addressing these issues across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The End of Being a Duke Professor and What It Means for the Future of Higher Ed</title>
<link>https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2019/04/the-end-of-being-a-duke-professor-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-higher-education/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2019/04/the-end-of-being-a-duke-professor-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-higher-education/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The end of the spring semester marks the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of my professorship at Duke, first as an assistant professor and then as an associate professor of the practice at the Sanford School of Public Policy. During this time, I regularly taught the required ethics class for all undergraduate public policy majors. I won multiple teaching awards, consistently received scores on student teaching evaluations above the school average and, in a &lt;em&gt;Duke Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; poll of undergraduates, was ranked as one of the three most popular professors at Duke University for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I was blindsided last April when informed that my contract would not be renewed, particularly given that for the past five years (I was on a five-year renewable contract) I was never informed of any problem with any aspect of my performance. Nor was I given an evaluation, despite a change to the Duke bylaws in 2017 mandating such reviews (&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EM5UGRZ3i7SLgii-soPhh2rIbcME026x&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When word of the non-renewal of my contract got out, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/05/in-defense-of-professor-evan-charney&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; written in my defense, signed by 100 former students, was published in the &lt;em&gt;Duke&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;, and these same students and others began a &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z5j3SMyEFxweWNYKtMMHILQcG-JwjwOr&quot;&gt;letter-writing campaign&lt;/a&gt; imploring the Sanford administration to reconsider their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April, I filed a complaint with the Faculty Hearing Committee (FHC), a university-wide committee tasked with hearing faculty complaints on matters such as tenure and contract renewal. In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qrGaqKye_5hJxEAFYmTrzNYLJeXVlnF7&quot;&gt;written report&lt;/a&gt;, they made clear (as Sanford never did) the actual reason for the loss of my job: Dissatisfaction with my “classroom performance.” Specifically, according to Sanford:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Charney’s tendency to provoke negative reactions, and perhaps harm, among some students in the classroom due to his confrontational teaching style—a style that had a tendency to be polarizing among students, particularly in a required Sanford course in which not all students could choose to have Professor Charney as an instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an astonishing claim that stands in stark contrast to the assessment of the FHC itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members of the panel were disappointed with Sanford’s handling of Professor Charney’s reappointment. Professor Charney was, for many years at Duke, a highly-rated, University-decorated, and—for many, many students—beloved and formative professor. He was an asset to Duke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April, I was informed that my contract would expire in one year—and was then assigned to teach two classes of the &lt;em&gt;very same required Sanford course&lt;/em&gt;, one in the fall and one this spring, in which I supposedly had a tendency to harm students. If Sanford actually believed their own rhetoric, they would be guilty of knowingly endangering their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I lose my job on the basis of my purportedly having a tendency to harm students, when there was no evidence of such a tendency, either in my student evaluations or any other feedback I received from students and faculty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, I believe, is twofold: First, the complaint of a handful of students concerning the events of a single class in which we discussed racism at Duke; second, an administration willing to give this complaint absolute credence and greater weight than a record of 20 years as an outstanding teacher, and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=15zN2kDoj0fz0zkQXX7ZYF1te1s8f_6N3&quot;&gt;distort that record&lt;/a&gt; to ensure a negative vote of the faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely troubling that the complaint of a handful of students proved dispositive, inasmuch as most students who were in the very same class had very different reactions to my teaching. Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z5j3SMyEFxweWNYKtMMHILQcG-JwjwOr&quot;&gt;one representative example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a woman of color, I write to bring attention to an aspect of Charney’s teaching that will be as missed as much as it is needed in today’s political climate…The climate at Duke reflects the polarization of the country at large. Conversations are halted before they can even begin. Instead of listening, instead of understanding or trying to understand, people on both sides are combative and dismissive…Charney taught us how to have those conversations, how to navigate race relations, how to empathize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, I am a provocative professor. I challenge students’ deeply held beliefs and expose them to material some would find shocking and offensive. Far from having a tendency to provoke negative reactions, harm, and polarization, it is precisely my method of teaching that has made me such a popular teacher and has led student after student to assert that my class &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z5j3SMyEFxweWNYKtMMHILQcG-JwjwOr&quot;&gt;changed her life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;epq-pull-quote epq-pull-quote-default epq-align-left&quot;&gt;An ideologically driven and enforced conception of harm is fundamentally at odds with the principle of faculty free expression.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to me is being repeated at colleges and universities throughout the country. Unfortunately, a growing number of university students equate being made uncomfortable in the classroom with being “harmed.” And in this they are encouraged by a growing number of faculty and administrators who view the mission of the university as more about shielding students from such “harm” (for the sake of “inclusivity”) and less about meaningful education. In the “surveillance university,” students are encouraged to report on the transgressions of faculty, and in what has been called an impulse of “vindictive protectiveness,” faculty are judged guilty and harshly punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such protectiveness is motivated less by a reasonable concern for students’ mental health and more by political ideology. The complaint of a group of conservative students who felt singled out or disrespected or uncomfortable in class would be taken &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/02/siegel-hypocrisy&quot;&gt;far less seriously&lt;/a&gt;. I have been on the receiving end of faculty emails making light of just such complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/04/180420-priester-being-christian-at-duke&quot;&gt;a complaint by religious students&lt;/a&gt; that God and Christianity were mocked by their professor have much purchase. And I have never heard that Sanford’s “safe space” is a welcome refuge for the (generally reviled) minority of “open” Trump supporters on campus, nor have I heard of “trigger warnings” for depictions of disrespect to the American flag or harm to the unborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an ideologically driven and enforced conception of harm is fundamentally at odds with the principle of faculty free expression (teaching &lt;em&gt;style&lt;/em&gt; is as much a matter of free expression as course content or ideological viewpoint). It is, to borrow a phrase from First Amendment jurisprudence, a content-based restriction on speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear: I am not calling for an expansion of the ethos of vindictive protectiveness to be all-inclusive. I am, rather, calling for its abandonment as it is deeply corrosive to the educational mission of a university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Duke, like colleges and universities throughout the country, is relying ever more on non-tenure track faculty. Given that tenure was instituted to protect faculty speech in all of its manifestations, this is a cause for concern. The political climate on campuses may be such that even tenured faculty have something to fear, but the threat is particularly great for the growing ranks of non-tenured faculty. It creates a strong incentive to avoid any style of teaching that might conceivably cause discomfort to students who fall within the ambit of an ideologically driven protectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching shaped by fear, especially when dealing with controversial topics (assuming such topics are not avoided altogether) will never be effective teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the FHC noted in this regard, “even if every member of this panel viewed it as deeply wrongheaded, a school or department at Duke could decide that it simply did not want a POP [Professor of the Practice] in any of its classrooms who would make any student feel uncomfortable at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s to being deeply wrongheaded.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Expects to Be Fined Up to $5B by FTC Over Privacy Issues</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook said on Wednesday that it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2019-Results/default.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expected to be fined&lt;/a&gt; up to $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations. The penalty would be a record by the agency against a technology company and a sign that the United States was willing to punish big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The social network disclosed the amount in its quarterly financial results, saying it estimated a one-time charge of $3 billion to $5 billion in connection with an “ongoing inquiry” by the F.T.C. Facebook added that “the matter remains unresolved, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Facebook has been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/facebook-ftc-settlement.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;in negotiations&lt;/a&gt; with the regulator for months over a financial penalty for claims that the company violated a 2011 privacy consent decree. That year, the social network promised a series of measures to protect its users’ privacy after an investigation found that its handling of data had harmed consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.T.C. opened a new investigation last year after Facebook came under fire again. This time, the company was accused of not protecting its users’ data from being harvested without their consent by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;, a British political consulting firm that was building voter profiles for the Trump campaign. Facebook also &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;suffered a data breach&lt;/a&gt; that exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Levying a sizable fine on Facebook would go against the reputation of the United States of not restraining the power of big tech companies. For years, American regulators have faced criticism that they allowed Silicon Valley firms to grow unchecked, even as their European counterparts aggressively brought actions against tech companies — including &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/google-eu-android-fine.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;fining Google a record $5.1 billion&lt;/a&gt; last year for abusing its power in the mobile phone market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For the Trump administration, penalizing Facebook would be a defining action. Although President Trump has rolled back scores of business regulations, he and others in Washington — including Democrats — have coalesced around calling for greater scrutiny and enforcement of tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and presidential candidate, has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;called for the breakup&lt;/a&gt; of Amazon, Google and Facebook. And Mr. Trump has sounded alarms over the dominance of the firms and their control over speech and the distribution of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It would also be a milestone for the F.T.C., whose biggest fine for a tech company was $22 million against Google in 2012 for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools. The agency, which is charged with overseeing deceptive and unfair business practices, is riding a wave of anti-tech sentiment as questions about how tech companies have contributed to misinformation, election meddling and data privacy problems have stacked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The F.T.C. is really limited in what they can actually do in enforcing a consent decree, but in the case of Facebook, they had public pressure on their side,” said Justin Brookman, a former official for the regulator who is now a director of privacy at Consumers Union, nonprofit consumer advocacy group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But some lawmakers said a fine would not suffice in punishing Facebook. Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that “a fine in the low billions of dollars would amount to a slap on the wrist for Facebook” and that Congress needed to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Facebook must be held accountable — not just by fines — but also far reaching reforms in management, privacy practices and culture,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, added in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.T.C. declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Officials at the agency have not reached a final decision on Facebook, said two people with knowledge of the situation, who were not authorized to speak publicly. In recent weeks, the agency’s chairman, Joseph Simons, sent strict orders to all commission offices and staff in the consumer protection, enforcement and privacy bureaus to not discuss the Facebook case, two people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Facebook’s estimate of a fine signaled that a settlement with the F.T.C. was near. The Securities and Exchange Commission typically requires that a company notify investors of any significant financial hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For Facebook, a $5 billion fine would amount to a fraction of its $56 billion in annual revenue. Any resolution would also alleviate some of the regulatory pressure that has been intensifying against the company over the past two and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This would be a joke of a fine — a two-weeks-of-revenue, parking-ticket-level penalty for destroying democracy,” said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that is a vocal critic of the power of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;More meaningful to Facebook would be any regulatory mandates that curbed its ability to share data with business partners or required it to take more measures to inform consumers when and how it collected data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Those will have the most lasting impact on consumers’ privacy,” said Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technology officer for the trade commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even as the negotiations continue, Facebook’s business remains robust. The company said Wednesday that its revenue increased 26 percent in the first quarter to $15 billion from a year earlier. Net income dropped 51 percent from a year ago to $2.4 billion because of the expected one-time charge related to the F.T.C. investigation. The company has more than $40 billion in cash reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;New users continue flocking to Facebook. More than 2.7 billion people use one of the company’s so-called family of apps — Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — each month. The company said about 1.56 billion people use Facebook every day, up 8 percent from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, said he planned to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-privacy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;start shifting people toward private conversations&lt;/a&gt; and away from public broadcasting on social media, which is likely to help the company manage issues of toxic content and misinformation. On Wednesday in a conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg repeated that vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“People want a platform that is as strong on privacy as possible,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. He added that “we just don’t know” how the change would affect the company’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg also said &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-regulation-explained.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;he welcomed regulations&lt;/a&gt;, an idea that he has increasingly been vocal about this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think it’s necessary,” he said. “Getting these issues right is more important than our interests. And I believe that regulation will help establish trust when people know that the right systems of governance and accountability are in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Inflammation might be the root of preventable disease</title>
<link>https://harvardmagazine.com/2019/05/inflammation-disease-diet</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://harvardmagazine.com/2019/05/inflammation-disease-diet</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;firstwords&quot;&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; 2007, associate professor of medicine Samia Mora and colleagues published a study of exercise that sought to understand why physical activity is salutary. They already knew that exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease as much as cholesterol-lowering statin drugs do. By analyzing biomarkers in the blood of 27,055 women participating in a long-term study, and other objective measures, they hoped to tease out the source of this effect. How much of the benefit was attributable to improved blood pressure? To lower body weight? Or to something else? The women had donated blood in the 1990s when they entered the study. Eleven years later, the researchers analyzed this frozen blood to see if they could find anything that correlated with long-term cardiovascular outcomes such as heart attack and stroke. “We were actually surprised that reduced inflammation was the biggest explainer, the biggest contributor to the benefit of activity,” says Mora, “because we hadn’t hypothesized that. We knew that regular exercise does reduce inflammation over the long term, but we also knew that acute exercise transiently &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; inflammatory biomarkers during and immediately after exertion.” About a third of the benefit of regular exercise, they found, is attributable to reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-inflammatory effect of exercise was much greater than most people had expected. That raised another question: whether inflammation might also play a dominant role in other lifestyle illnesses that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, two cardiologists at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who suspected such a link, published the results of a human clinical trial that will forever change the way people think about inflammation. The trial, which involved more than 10,000 patients in 39 countries, was primarily designed to determine whether an anti-inflammatory drug, by itself, could lower rates of cardiovascular disease in a large population, without simultaneously lowering levels of cholesterol, as statin drugs do. The answer was yes. But the researchers went a step further, building into the trial additional tests seeking to clarify what effect the same anti-inflammatory drug, canakinumab, might have on illnesses seemingly &lt;em&gt;unrelated&lt;/em&gt; to cardiovascular disease: arthritis, gout, and cancer. Only the researchers themselves, and their scientific colleagues, were unsurprised by the outcome. Lung cancer mortality dropped by as much as 77 percent. Reports of arthritis and gout also fell significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medicine, believing something is true is not the same as being able to prove it. Because the idea that inflammation—constant, low-level, immune-system activation —could be at the root of many noncommunicable diseases is a startling claim, it requires &lt;em&gt;extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; proof. Can seemingly unconnected illnesses of the brain, the vasculature, lungs, liver, and joints really share a deep biological link? Evidence has been mounting that these common chronic conditions—including Alzheimer’s, cancer, arthritis, asthma, gout, psoriasis, anemia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and depression among them—are indeed triggered by low-grade, long-term inflammation. But it took that large-scale human clinical trial to dispel any lingering doubt: the immune system’s inflammatory response is killing people by degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the pertinent question is why, and what can be done about it. The pharmaceutical industry is deeply interested in finding ways to stop inflammation with medicines like canakinumab, an orphan drug that blocks a specific pro-inflammatory pathway called IL-1beta. But some researchers suggest that the inflammatory process—a normal and necessary part of the natural immune response—has itself has been misunderstood. Scientists know that the process can be turned on and off, but have only recently understood that this doesn’t mean normal physiology will resume once the inflammation caused by infection, injury, or irritant has been shut down. Instead, the restoration of health is an &lt;em&gt;active phase&lt;/em&gt; of the inflammatory process itself, facilitated by a little-known class of molecules called pro-resolving mediators—the protectins, resolvins, maresins, and lipoxins—brimming with marvelous, untapped, regenerative capacities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Origins of Atherosclerosis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;firstwords&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; 2017 clinical trial, called CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study), is the result of a long-term collaboration between Paul Ridker and Peter Libby, who suspected as long ago as the 1980s that inflammation played a role in cardiovascular disease. Ridker, an epidemiologist who is Braunwald professor of medicine, came to this conclusion through studies of cardiac patients. He is the physician-scientist who first demonstrated that a molecule called C-reactive protein (CRP), easily measured by a simple and now ubiquitous blood test, could be used like a thermometer to take the temperature of a patient’s inflammation. Elevated CRP, he discovered years ago, predicts future cardiovascular events, including heart attacks. Although nobody knows what it does biologically, this marker is downstream from IL-1beta, and thus provides a reliable yardstick of that pro-inflammatory pathway’s level of activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imagecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://harvardmagazine.com/sites/default/files/inline_images/2019-MayJune/HM_MJ19_ART_Page_46_Image_0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Paul Ridker and Peter Libby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Photograph by Jim Harrison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libby, the Mallinckrodt professor of medicine, is a bench scientist and clinician with expertise in the study of heart disease. In the 1980s, orthodoxy within the cardiovascular establishment held that circulating fats (including cholesterol) build up in the arteries of patients with progressive cardiovascular disease. But no one knew why or how the plaques formed. It took work by some of the most distinguished cardiology researchers of the era to lay the groundwork that eventually produced an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive deposition of those plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, in his Harvard Medical School (HMS) office, Libby sketches the origins of atherosclerosis. The interior walls of blood vessels, he explains, are made from smooth muscle cells, lined in turn with endothelial cells that are in direct contact with circulating blood. When a problem arises, caused by anything from cholesterol to bacteria, the vascular system recruits white blood cells, the immune system’s front-line guardians, to the site. Two Harvard professors of pathology, Michael Gimbrone Jr. and the late Ramzi Cotran, figured out that naturally occurring adhesion molecules could attract these white blood cells and get them to stick to the endothelium lining the arteries. Their experiments implicated a pro-inflammatory signal called interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is produced by both circulating and tissue-based immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageleft&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://harvardmagazine.com/sites/default/files/inline_images/2019-MayJune/HM_MJ19_ART_Page_47_Image_0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The pentameric molecular structure of C-reactive protein, a biomarker of inflammation that circulates in the blood.

Shrive/Wellcome Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libby, then at Tufts, followed their work closely. IL-1 had been discovered in 1977 by one of his Tufts colleagues, Charles Dinarello, who had been focused on understanding what causes fever, one of the cardinal signs of inflammation. The others, described by Aulus Cornelius Celsus in the first century &lt;span class=&quot;firstwords&quot;&gt;c.e.&lt;/span&gt;, are redness (&lt;em&gt;rubor)&lt;/em&gt;, which occurs when the endothelial lining of arteries dilates to permit more blood flow; swelling (&lt;em&gt;tumor),&lt;/em&gt; caused by endothelial cells leaking protein, which carries water; and pain (&lt;em&gt;dolor&lt;/em&gt;). By measuring the factors in rabbits’ blood, Dinarello was able to isolate and then clone the specific factor—called a pyrogen—that causes fever: interleukin-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before this inflammatory pyrogen even had a name, Dinarello gave some to Libby, whose lab was down the hall. Libby discovered that arterial wall cells not only responded to IL-1, but could &lt;em&gt;secrete&lt;/em&gt; it. This was heretical, he explains, because it was thought that only “a properly pedigreed immunological cell” could produce such signals. Now it was clear that the cells of the artery walls were capable of summoning an immune response. Libby further found that IL-1, by altering gene expression in local blood vessel cells, &lt;em&gt;amplifies&lt;/em&gt; its signal at the site of the disease. But, “No one in cardiology was interested in inflammation” then, Libby notes. In fact, none of his early work on IL-1 appears in the cardiology literature: “My papers were rejected,” he recalls; “my grants turned down.” In 1986, he published his first paper showing that the lining of the arteries could produce IL-1 in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Pathology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Evolution of Excessive Inflammation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;firstwords&quot;&gt;Today,&lt;/span&gt; inflammation is a focus of intense research in many fields. Roni Nowarski, assistant professor of neurology and immunology, explains that inflammation is important across a range of seemingly distinct pathologies because immune cells are everywhere, even resident in organs, where they play an important role in monitoring and maintaining health. The paradigm that everyone knows—that the immune system’s front line consists of circulating white blood cells that patrol the body to guard against infection and injury—is a bit misleading. An important arm of the immune system resides outside the blood vessels. Pac-Man-like macrophages occupy tissues, where they engulf and digest invading pathogens, debris, and dying cells. An invaluable role of these tissue macrophages is to “act as sensors,” Nowarski says. “They have hard-wired mechanisms to detect signals that are out of the ordinary,” and so play a critical role in maintaining a healthy equilibrium. “If there is any fluctuation,” he notes, “the role of these cells is to return the system to this point of homeostasis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tissue-based white blood cells can also call for backup. When that happens, the heavy guns of the immune system, neutrophils, are first to arrive on the scene. These are “potent, aggressive cells” that can kill infectious agents, Nowarski explains, but “can also cause a lot of damage to healthy tissue.” That’s why most neutrophils are short-lived, with a tightly regulated lifespan of just a few hours: unchecked, they would cause serious harm. Neutrophils, which originate in bone marrow, also play a role in relaxing the endothelial barrier that separates blood from tissue, so immune cells can cross that barrier to reach the site of attack. Other signals—like the IL-1beta protein that Libby and Ridker blocked in their trial—promote adhesion, in order to capture circulating immune cells that reach the damaged tissue. This stickiness, though desirable in the short term, is also the basis of the process that can lead to atherosclerosis if it continues indefinitely. The endgame of a &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt; immune response, on the other hand, involves cleanup, says Nowarski: even the death and uptake of neutrophils as they are gobbled by macrophages serve as signals to resolve inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why inflammation sometimes &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; resolve, and becomes chronic instead, is in some sense easily explained in evolutionary terms. “If I’m living 70,000 years ago at a time of food shortage,” says Ridker, “and there’s a drought, the 5 to 10 percent of people who will survive that drought are likely to have insulin resistance”—a tendency to store more calories as fat. “They’re going to live a little longer,” he continues. “When it finally rains, food comes, and that’s the survivor group. In a modern world of too much food, [insulin resistance] leads to diabetes. But in prehistory, it’s terribly important for survival.” While stored fat is beneficial during times of famine, it also harbors potentially damaging pro-inflammatory signaling molecules (see “Eating to Excess: Metabolic Inflammation,” below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second evolved factor is that prior to the development of antibiotics, disease “wiped out half the population before age five. So, people were under evolutionary pressure to have a hyperactive immune system.” Now, “most everybody survives childhood infections,” thanks in large part to vaccines. “But this hyperactive immune system remains, and adversely affects aging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The third piece—beyond starvation and infection—is trauma,” Ridker says. “The saber-toothed tiger—or for women, bleeding to death during childbirth—selects on a genetic basis for hypercoagulable blood. So here we are, by definition all of us lucky enough to be alive today, with a consistent ancestry all the way back to the beginning. And we have all inherited a pro-inflammatory, insulin resistant, pro-coagulable state. Under the circumstances,” he continues, the fact that “we have an epidemic of diabetes and heart disease makes complete sense.” Evolutionary pressures have shaped a physiological system which is phenomenally well suited for surviving childhood infection, starvation, and predation. “But it contributes to many disorders of chronic aging, because from an evolutionary perspective, if you’ve had your kids, you’re kind of done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution also explains why the underlying biology appears so similar from one disease to the next. Kennedy professor of child neurology and mental retardation Rudy Tanzi studies Alzheimer’s disease, which is well known for causing plaques and tangles in the brain. In 2008, Tanzi and his colleagues discovered a gene that clearly played a role in the development of the disease, but didn’t know how it worked. Five years later, they discovered that the gene is the “on” switch for inflammation in the brain. Tanzi says the work that has most influenced his thinking is the body of resilience studies conducted by Teresa Gomez-Isla, an associate professor of neurology based at Massachusetts General Hospital, who has shown that “you can have a brain full of plaques and tangles, but if you don’t have neuroinflammation, you don’t get the disease”—a finding that neatly parallels the pathological interactions between plaques and inflammation in atherosclerosis. This basic research on inflammation thus underlies understanding of entire classes of human illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such similarities among diseases of metabolism and inflammation suggest that they are indeed rooted far back in evolutionary history. Gökhan S. Hotamisligil, Simmons professor of genetics and metabolism at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has constructed his research for the past 25 years on the premise that this shared history suggests shared &lt;em&gt;biological&lt;/em&gt; mechanisms as well. The ailments that cluster most dramatically, he points out, are “chronic metabolic diseases” such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, nerve degeneration, and cancer. In general, a person who has any one of these illnesses is more likely to develop the others. “This is exactly the same cluster that emerges during aging,” he says. “All of the age-related pathologies exhibit as clusters of non-communicable diseases, except in a much shorter period of time, and earlier in the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That tells us that these illnesses are part of our natural history, our biological heritage,” continues Hotamisligil, who directs the Sabri Ülker Center for Metabolic Research. “If these two clusters emerge in two separate conditions in exactly the same way, that must come from deeply embedded evolutionary vulnerabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;callout&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Chronic inflammation is uniformly damaging and is absolutely causal to the process, because if you interfere with it, you can reverse the pathology.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics might suggest that inflammation is just a symptom in these diseases, rather than a cause. But Hotamisligil says, unequivocally, “Chronic inflammation is uniformly damaging and is absolutely causal to the process, because if you interfere with it, you can reverse the pathology.” And this ability to control such diseases simply by reversing inflammation is a biological response, dating far back to the time of a common ancestor, that has been retained across diverse species of animals to the present day, he says, pointing to experimental evidence: “If you can make &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; [fruit fly] diabetic, and then block the inflammatory response systems, you can cure diabetes in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;, the same way you can reverse it in the mouse, in primates, and in humans, provided that you do it with the right tools. Of course, the higher the organism, the more complex these pathways are, so it takes more effort to define the precise mechanisms to manipulate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Eating to Excess: Metabolic Inflammation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;firstwords&quot;&gt;Seeking the origins&lt;/span&gt; of inflammation, Hotamisligil asks, “What is the most primordial process in the emergence of life? Metabolism. Energy management. And then, of course, the next critical process to emerge within cells is the ability to defend. And so that brings in the immune system, which is younger than metabolism, but much older than many other systems.” In some of the simplest organisms, he points out, energy management and immune functions are packaged in the same organ, such as the fruit fly’s fat body. But even as these functions became specialized and divided among three or four organs in more complex organisms, they retained their evolutionary memory. “They share many tricks,” he says, because the “immune response is enormously expensive, energy-wise.” The intimate relationship between the metabolic and immune systems, he believes, has been maintained because it takes “tremendous energy to mount an effective immune response. While this link is essential to maintain health and homeostasis, abnormalities that develop over time, as in the case of obesity, carry a great risk of damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metabolic stress that is a hallmark of modern life, the stress that the body has &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; evolved to handle, is constant eating, he continues. When people eat, energy and nutrients enter the body rapidly, are processed, produce in turn a lot of by-products, and then need to be reduced to “functional substances that are distributed throughout the body, and then disappear very quickly. Many cells and tissues actually undergo a huge amount of stress during this process,” he explains, “as they store appropriate nutrients and dispose of harmful intermediates.” Part of this process also involves mounting an immune response. “The pancreas, for example, must secrete four to five hundred milliliters of enzymes every day” to be able to manage the incoming energy load with every meal. “If you place these organs under constant stress, they start malfunctioning.” The consequence is that “right now, one out of every 10 individuals has diabetes. One out of every four individuals has fatty liver disease. And if you reach a certain age, one out of every three individuals will develop neurodegenerative disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metabolic stress that underlies these conditions comes from the daily imbalance between how much energy people consume and how much they need, and can process in a healthy manner. The long-term consequence of overconsumption, combined with lack of sufficient expenditure, is stored energy—the accumulation of fat. Excess body fat, especially in the wrong places, is an &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; risk factor for inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical studies implicating stored fat as a source of inflammation have been buttressed by basic research that shows that adipose tissue—body fat—is laced with immune cells, which become more abundant with weight gain, perhaps because fat cells can secrete alarm signals that summon white blood cells. “A fat cell is almost like a primitive immune cell,” says Hotamisligil. “It can request the assistance of immune cells when in trouble, but if the stress continues, and the immune cells remain, they start changing their character and behavior from helpful to harmful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imageright&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://harvardmagazine.com/sites/default/files/inline_images/2019-MayJune/HM_Inflam_Adipose.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A fat cell, or adipocyte, is more than 90 percent triglyceride. If the thin cell wall enclosing this droplet of fat ruptures, an inflammatory response ensues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;iStock Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is additional evidence that the &lt;em&gt;physical structure&lt;/em&gt; of fat cells, or adipocytes, which have been described by Stephen O’Rahilly of the University of Cambridge as resembling a fried egg atop a beach ball of fat—with a tiny rim of cytoplasm encircling the droplet of triglyceride—puts them at risk of rupture. Adipocytes are “cells at the edge under the best of circumstances,” explains Hotamisligil. Ninety percent or more of a fat cell’s volume is triglyceride, a substance chemically similar to diesel fuel. The remaining 10 percent is all the space it has for the organelles that perform the normal functions of cell biology. This bloated cell is thus vulnerable to stress, even to the point of bursting and death. When overloaded with stored lipid, fat cells begin to lose their functional and structural integrity and may start spilling their toxic cargo. When cells fail like this, the immune system kicks in, initially to assist in clean-up. Macrophages engorge themselves on the leaking fuel, and may die themselves during this process. But in the long run, what is meant to be a mutually beneficial interaction between the metabolic and immune systems turns into a very dangerous and harmful relationship. Obese individuals thus live in a state of chronic stress and inflammation; in fact, many people do, because their energy intake vastly exceeds their needs. Hotamisligil calls this chronic energy overload, and the resulting abnormal immune response, &lt;em&gt;metaflammation:&lt;/em&gt; metabolic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is pretty clear that inflammation is a bad actor in obesity,” says Korsmeyer professor of cell biology and medicine Bruce Spiegelman. His lab was the first to establish the mechanism linking obesity to inflammation—in 1993, when he and Hotamisligil, then a doctoral student, discovered that fat cells produce an inflammatory signal that interferes with the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar. This, in turn, increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But inflammation in muscle, he says, is “much more complicated.” In fact, “it is likely that you &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; inflammation in exercise,” and that the inflammatory response should not be suppressed—for example, by taking ibuprofen—because that signal is likely “telling the muscle to remodel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with Rasmussen professor of immunohematology Diane Mathis, Spiegelman is about to begin studying exercised muscle, a natural system that incorporates and manages inflammation on a regular basis. Mathis studies regulatory T-cells (Tregs), white blood cells that are actively involved in maintaining the internal stability (homeostasis) of tissues. Recently, she has sought to understand the role of Tregs in repairing muscle &lt;em&gt;injured&lt;/em&gt; as a consequence of physical trauma or disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, by studying muscle that has been &lt;em&gt;exercised&lt;/em&gt;, she and Spiegelman hope to gain a better understanding of how inflammation is “supposed to happen, and how it eventually &lt;em&gt;resolves&lt;/em&gt;.” The sequence, he says, occurs in four steps: “There’s damage, inflammation, resolution of inflammation, and repair. These phases are very different.” He and Mathis hope to learn how these processes unfold—and ultimately, perhaps, to learn how to stimulate, support, or mimic the body’s natural mechanisms of resolution and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Controlling Inflammation, Boosting the Immune System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;firstwords&quot;&gt;Epidemiological studies&lt;/span&gt; have helped clarify the importance of lifestyle choices in controlling inflammation. Samia Mora’s 2007 research highlighted the role of exercise. In 2018, she and her colleagues published a study of the Mediterranean diet, which is known to improve cardiovascular health (and also thought to protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s). Mora examined the effect of this diet on the women who previously participated in the exercise research, 20 years after they had entered the original study. They found that adherence to a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, nuts, legumes, and olive oil, that also includes fish and chicken, but that is very low in red and processed meat and sugary foods or drinks, led to a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular events. As in the exercise study, they found that about a third of the benefit was due to reductions in inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imagecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://harvardmagazine.com/sites/default/files/inline_images/2019-MayJune/HM_MJ19_ART_Page_49_Image_0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Samia Mora&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Photograph by Jim Harrison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some of the diet’s benefit could not be explained, meaning that an untested factor was enhancing its healthful effect. Mora speculates that the diet (which includes probiotic foods such as Greek yogurt) might support the health of the gut microbiome, or might stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, as exercise does, to help people relax. Alternatively, the diet might be protective against oxidative stress of the kind that comes from pollution or smoking. Perhaps unsurprisingly, each of these possibilities is linked to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great difficulty with interventions involving altered diet and increased exercise is that these healthy habits aren’t aligned with preferences evolved during millennia of food scarcity. People already know what they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing—but for most, that knowledge doesn’t change behavior. Humans are hard-wired to conserve energy (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://harvardmagazine.com/2016/09/born-to-rest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Born to Rest,”&lt;/a&gt; September-October 2016, page 9), for example, and to prefer foods that are fatty, salty, and sugary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that pharmaceutical interventions that block inflammation may be necessary to check the global epidemic of non-communicable disease. How to do that is not obvious, however. The intervention that Ridker and Libby devised, blocking a single inflammatory pathway with a drug, helped only a fraction of patients with cardiovascular disease. That is probably because a system as important to sustaining life as immune response has evolved redundancies: block one pathway and another will take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the CANTOS study did establish was a biological principle, says Ridker: “Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive are not the same thing.” Suppressing an immune pathway like IL-1beta could have led to reactivation of tuberculosis infections or complications of HIV. But it didn’t. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a slight increase in the risk of viral and bacterial infections—but these were “run of the mill infections,” he says. “Had we known in advance, we could very easily have taken care of these with some very simple antibiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of experiment is important, he continues, because it will change the way drugs like canakinumab, currently classified as an immunosuppressant, are categorized. That opens new areas to investigate, he says: “We can actually give high-risk patients this kind of anti-inflammatory without risking immunosuppression. And that’s incredibly useful information for my infectious-disease colleagues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe, however, that to prevent certain inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; inflammatory pathways will need to be blocked to have a large effect. And blocking several of these signaling mechanisms simultaneously, they say, will almost surely suppress the immune system, exposing people to potentially fatal infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence scientists’ interests in another possibility that doesn’t include any risk of immunosuppression: resolving inflammation through a recently discovered class of molecules called specialized pro-resolving mediators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Super Family of Resolving Molecules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;firstwords&quot;&gt;Gelman professor&lt;/span&gt; of anaesthesia Charles Serhan has been studying how inflammation ends for 25 years. He realized early on that after the immune system’s soldiers have fought off an invader, the battlefield is littered with bodies: dead cells and scattered debris. The fact that infection has been defeated does not mean that the affected tissue will automatically, passively, return to normal function. There is another process at work, factors that clean up the mess, remove bodies, and repair systems so that the physiological balance within the tissue can be restored. Working with other scientists around the world, he discovered a new class of molecules that actively resolve inflammation. “It turns out that there’s a whole super family of these,” he explains, “and it’s their collapse,” which occurs naturally with aging, that leads to chronic, unresolved immune-system stimulation. “These specialized pro-resolving mediators [SPMs] have been shown in many animal models to reverse inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imagecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://harvardmagazine.com/sites/default/files/inline_images/2019-MayJune/HM_MJ19_ART_Page_50_Image_0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Charles Serhan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Photograph by Jim Harrison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPMs are unusual immune-signaling molecules, in the sense that they are fats (lipid-derived small molecules), not proteins. They can also mute pain. Their precursors—the substances the body needs in order to synthesize these potent resolving compounds—are the essential fatty acids, including the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, and arachidonic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments with animals deficient in SPMs, Serhan has shown that injecting SPMs amplifies the magnitude of the healing response, causing injuries to mend more quickly. He emphasizes that reversing inflammation in this way is not the same as blocking it from occurring in the first place. When inflammatory pathways are turned off, there is always a risk that the immune response will be compromised, and that infection will ensue. The SPMs instead work in concert with the immune response by stimulating macrophages “to clear dead cells, debris, and bacteria,” he says. “Then they bring the system back to homeostasis, and begin to push the buttons to signal tissue regeneration.” (They even stimulate the Tregs that Diane Mathis studies to produce an anti-inflammatory signal called IL-10.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen work. They &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; a particular signal. But Serhan discovered that aspirin works differently (and in a multi-faceted way): rather than blocking inflammatory signals, it attenuates them. In addition, it has mild anti-coagulant properties that are beneficial in atherosclerosis. And perhaps most importantly, aspirin stimulates the production of at least two classes of health-promoting SPMs. In work published as this magazine went to press, Serhan and colleagues showed that aspirin stimulates the production of a distinct type of SPM that fights cancer tumors in mice, and another SPM that inhibits cancer tumor formation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serhan has recently developed a method for creating blood profiles of individuals that reveal whether they have sufficient levels of these circulating resolving molecules, which include classes of compounds called resolvins, protectins, maresins, and lipoxins. Resolvins, for example, have proven beneficial against periodontitis in rabbits and retinopathy and colitis in mice. Protectins have proven effective in preventing ischemic stroke in rats, and against Alzheimer’s in humans. Lipoxins have attenuated pleurisy and cystic fibrosis in mice. And maresins have accelerated wound-healing in mice, and blocked the perception of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, he has demonstrated the benefits of such SPMs in preventing neurodegeneration, and is beginning to study their use by professional football players, who suffer high rates of tissue injuries. Serhan has shown that SPMs can be used to control the inflammation that occurs when blood flow resumes to tissues that have been deprived of oxygen during surgery. And he has created an inflammation-resolving mouth rinse that has been tested in periodontal disease and shown to be safe. In earlier experiments, he demonstrated that pro-resolving eye drops can be used to control inflammation in the eye, which “naturally makes buckets of this stuff in tears, so you are bathing normally in pro-resolving mediators.” SPMs are also abundant in the brain, he has found. These are places where avoiding acute inflammation is absolutely critical: infections of the brain can be fatal, and in the eye can lead to blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleagues of Serhan’s are using resolvins to control asthma and to stimulate surgical-wound healing. They are also investigating their effects on the microbiome. Earlier animal studies showed that resolvins reduce rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;imagecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://harvardmagazine.com/sites/default/files/inline_images/2019-MayJune/HM_Inflam_Chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these compounds have not yet been synthesized as pharmaceuticals, maintaining healthy levels of SPMs is best supported by foods rich in the essential fatty acids EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid. “There’s a reason they are called ‘essential,’” says Serhan. “You can only get them from your diet.” Fish contains all three, although arachidonic acid is also present in chicken, eggs, and beef, and EPA and DHA can be obtained from certain plant sources and algae. It’s ironic, he points out, that veterinary science has ensured that lab animals (and even pets) in the United States eat better than most people do, because animal food is fortified with omega-3s. Most Americans, he believes, don’t eat enough of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;callout&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“To treat excessive inflammation...we don’t want to block the inflammatory response. We want to stimulate the resolution pathways.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;However illuminating Serhan’s molecular work has proven, though, the conceptual contribution of his research may be his lasting legacy. “One of things that we are trying to teach people from what we are learning is that we don’t want to knock anything out,” he says. “We want to fine-tune it.” Molecules such as IL-1beta—the target of the CANTOS trial—are important in the innate immune response, he explains. “To treat excessive inflammation, whether it is chronic or the result of an acute tissue injury, we don’t want to block the inflammatory response. We want to stimulate the resolution pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific study of inflammation has transformed human understanding of this innate biological response. What once were considered merely symptoms—redness, swelling, fever, and pain—are now implicated as the source of many afflictions. For healing, Serhan foresees, we should also look within.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;figure__caption sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mr10&quot;&gt;People with paralysing conditions such as motor-neuron disease often rely on technology to help them speak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: BJ Warnick/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to provide a voice for people who can’t speak, neuroscientists have designed a device that can transform brain signals into speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology isn’t yet accurate enough for use outside the lab, although it can synthesize whole sentences that are mostly intelligible. Its creators described their speech-decoding device in a study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01328-x#ref-CR1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; published on 24 April in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have previously used artificial intelligence to translate single words&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01328-x#ref-CR2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01328-x#ref-CR3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, mostly consisting of one syllable, from brain activity, says Chethan Pandarinath, a neuroengineer at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who co-wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://preview-www.nature.com/platform/rh/preview/page/nature/brain-implants-that-let-you-speak-your-mind/16645644?view=fragmentPreview&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://preview-www.nature.com/platform/rh/preview/page/nature/brain-implants-that-let-you-speak-your-mind/16645644?view=fragmentPreview&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the study. “Making the leap from single syllables to sentences is technically quite challenging and is one of the things that makes the current work so impressive,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mapping movements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people who have lost the ability to speak communicate using technology that requires them to make tiny movements to control a cursor that selects letters or words on a screen. UK physicist Stephen Hawking, who had motor-neuron disease, was one famous example. He used a speech-generating device activated by a muscle in his cheek, says study leader Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people who use such devices must type out words letter by letter, these devices can be very slow, producing up to ten words per minute, Chang says. Natural spoken speech averages 150 words per minute. “It’s the efficiency of the vocal tract that allows us to do that,” he says. And so Chang and his team decided to model the vocal system when constructing their decoder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers worked with five people who had electrodes implanted on the surface of their brains as part of epilepsy treatment. First, the team recorded brain activity as the participants read hundreds of sentences aloud. Then, Chang and his colleagues combined these recordings with data from previous experiments that determined how movements of the tongue, lips, jaw and larynx created sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team trained a deep-learning algorithm on these data, and then incorporated the program into their decoder. The device transforms brain signals into estimated movements of the vocal tract, and turns these movements into synthetic speech. People who listened to 101 synthesized sentences could understand 70% of the words on average, Chang says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another experiment, the researchers asked one participant to read sentences aloud and then to mime the same sentences by moving their mouth without producing sound. The sentences synthesized in this test were of lower quality than those created from audible speech, Chang says, but the results are still encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intelligible future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech created by mapping brain activity to movements of the vocal tract and translating them to sound is more easily understood than that produced by mapping brain activity directly to sound, says Stephanie Riès, a neuroscientist at San Diego State University in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s unclear whether the new speech decoder would work with words that people only think, says Amy Orsborn, a neural engineer at the University of Washington in Seattle. “The paper does a really good job of showing that this works for mimed speech,” she says. “But how would this work when someone’s not moving their mouth?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Slutzky, a neurologist at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, agrees and says that the decoder’s performance leaves room for improvement. He notes that listeners identified the synthesized speech by selecting words from a set of choices; as the number of choices increased, people had more trouble understanding the words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study “is a really important step, but there’s still a long way to go before synthesized speech is easily intelligible”, Slutzky says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The &amp;#039;Dark Ages&amp;#039; Weren&amp;#039;t as Dark as We Thought</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lithub.com/the-dark-ages-werent-as-dark-as-we-thought/</guid>
<description>&lt;span itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There can be few more damning or more useless terms than “the Dark Ages.” They sound fun in an orcs‐and‐elves sort of way and suggest a very low benchmark from which we have since, as a race, raised ourselves up into the light—with the present day using as its soundtrack the last movement of Beethoven’s Ninth. But the damage the term does is immense. A simple little mental test is just to quickly imagine a European scene from that era. Now: was the sun shining? Of course not. The default way of thinking about the long, complex era that lasted from the final decades of the Roman Empire to somewhere around the Battle of Hastings is to assume it all looked like the cover of a heavy metal album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem is that the older the period the more chances there are for its material production to be destroyed. Across Lotharingia [ed. note: one of three filial kingdoms born of the Carolingian Empire]  there has been century after century of rebuilding (with the re‐use of every available piece of old dressed stone) with most evidence of earlier churches and palaces removed in the process. In practical terms one cannot imagine that the vast, humorless bulk of Cologne Cathedral is merely the latest in a series stretching back to a Roman temple. Many of the great religious buildings of the Rhine have a display table showing somewhat conjectural models of their ancient predecessors, usually starting with a patronizing little wooden block, looking something like a skew‐whiff Wendy-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So great is the weight of “the Dark Ages” on our shoulders that it is almost impossible not to think of the makers of this wonky church slithering about on the mud floor cursing the way the roof was leaking and how nobody could design a door that shut properly, resigned to the occasional fiasco when the walls would simply fall in on the gurning, fur‐clad, battle‐axe‐wielding communicants. In practice, these now non‐existent buildings would have been extremely beautiful—drawing on Roman and Byzantine models, and stuffed with all kinds of wonderful stuff from the Roman Empire which now no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the related problem suffered by “the Dark Ages”—our towns often occupy exactly the same sites as they did then (the same river crossing, the same harbor) and are built on top of them, but there have been simply innumerable points at which older material has been destroyed. There is probably some rough mathematical calculation about how each passing century lowers your chance of anything much surviving at all. The famous fat boy of 1666—who was meant to be watching the baker’s oven, but instead gorged on pies, fell asleep and as a result burned down London—is only one of an elite group who caused mayhem through their momentary inattention over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;insert-post-ads&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Article continues after advertisement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- /76722702/in_article_banner_2 --&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-1482941823113-0&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every household routinely handling flames in wooden surroundings it is unsurprising that so many towns would often find themselves having to start again from scratch. We know far more about more recent horrors—for example, the gunpowder accident that destroyed much of Delft in 1654—but any 24‐hour period over the centuries was always fraught with some fumble‐fingered disaster somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;The true “dark age,” of course, was the early 1940s when, simply as a side effect of industrial killing, great swathes of the past disappeared.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unrelenting impact of warfare has of course done far more damage, wrecking town after town. Any breakdown in order or lunge for supremacy ends up with further pyres of the material past. Simply looking at recent disasters, many thousands of ancient records, treasures, histories, valued for centuries by custodians, were destroyed in the 1870 Siege of Strasbourg and the 1914 destruction of much of the Catholic University of Leuven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true “dark age,” of course, was the early 1940s when, simply as a side effect of industrial killing, great swathes of the past disappeared. One small yet major example—the extraordinary series of paintings of the visions of Hildegard of Bingen, made in the 1170s either by the saint herself or under her supervision, disappeared in the general catastrophe that unfolded in Dresden in early 1945. We only know what they looked like (except from black‐and‐white photos) through accurate and beautiful copies painted by a group of nuns, by sheer chance, in the 1930s. So these frail little works of disturbing genius survived nearly eight centuries before succumbing, and exist today only through the most ancient form of devotional copying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an over‐elaborate way of saying that in as much as the era after the Roman Empire is “dark” it is because it has been overlaid by many centuries of further things happening—and I have talked only about human agency rather than the terrors of mold, mice, lightning and damp. Our own “library” at home suffered catastrophic loss from a house‐rabbit called Dusty who in his short life ate the spines of innumerable books. My copy of Hermann Hesse’s &lt;em&gt;Narcissus and Goldmund&lt;/em&gt; is cherished, partly because I have owned it for so long, but also because of its memorial teeth marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the very last beautiful Roman fabric so sun‐rotted that it was chucked away? And that is as nothing compared to the almost totally successful attempts during the early Christian centuries in Europe to erase all trace of native paganism. This last issue is often overlooked. At the back of our minds when thinking about the centuries when the Roman Empire mutated into medieval Europe we are unconsciously taking on the spurious guise of specific communities. We are happy to read about Charlemagne destroying the Avar Empire and taking all its gold because at some level we emotionally sneak ourselves into Charlemagne’s baggage‐train. But the Avars ruled Central Europe for over two centuries, and it is not a given that their civilization had no worth and did not represent a future we would have flourished in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;insert-post-ads&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Article continues after advertisement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- /76722702/in_article_banner_3 --&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;div id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-1530020181920-0&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or earlier, there are the Alemanni in what is now south‐west Germany and Alsace (and after whom the French call Germany Allemagne) who were broken by the Frankish ruler Clovis. Of course, we are the heirs of Christianity, but only in a passive, non‐contributive way—to see ourselves on one specific side in these ancient contests is awkward. I might hiss at the antics of the Saxons and Vikings, but as someone part English and part Irish I am much more likely to have their genes than Frankish ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues become vivid in the town of Tournai—for centuries a French‐ruled enclave squeezed between the County of Flanders and the County of Hainaut and now part of Belgium, a classic crossroads through which every army has marched, from the legionaries of the Roman Empire to Allied troops in 1944. I may as well say here that Tournai is a fantastic historical palimpsest and somewhere that always puts a spring in my step. I once found myself changing trains there late at night and realizing that I had just enough time to haul my bag up the road through the freezing dark to look in renewed wonder at the vast, somber drum—like a stonebuilt gasometer—of the Henry VIII Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this current context, however, what makes Tournai so remarkable is the discovery during routine repairs to the Hospice of St Brice in the 1650s of the tomb of Childeric I. This accidental find catapulted everything back some 250 years before Charlemagne, to the century after the Western Roman Empire had collapsed, a world which must have still been densely Roman in its appearance, probably with much smaller populations in towns and more limited trade. Childeric’s son, Clovis I, was baptized, united the Frankish tribes and founded the Merovingian dynasty which lasted until Charlemagne’s dad put the last of them into a monastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;It was downhill for the hoard from then on.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management of Childeric’s tomb has not exactly been a curatorial model. It started well as by sheer good luck Tournai was then part of the Spanish Netherlands under the benign and intelligent leadership of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, who as part of his vast expenditure on art objects commissioned a superb book on the tomb from Jean‐Jacques Chifflet, an antiquarian from the Spanish‐ruled Franche‐Comté. This has immaculate pictures of the heaps of extraordinary stuff Childeric was buried with—gold objects of great variety and beauty from a bull’s head to coins, buckles, a crystal globe, seal‐rings and intricate pieces of cloisonné. It was downhill for the hoard from then on. Leopold Wilhelm took everything back to Vienna when he retired and left it to his nephew the Emperor Leopold I. He gave it to Louis XIV as a present but, in one of the many instances where Louis is so disappointing, he took no interest in the gifts and simply stored them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They survived the Revolution but were stolen in 1831 and dispersed or melted down. The hoard’s great aesthetic intervention came from its including dozens of small gold bees (or possibly cicadas), which must have decorated some object which had since rotted away, perhaps a cloak. In his search for an appropriate new symbol for his dynasty (the ancient fleur‐de‐lys being patently unacceptable to a new era) Napoleon decided to make these bees the imperial motif, scattering them on everything from coats of arms to Josephine’s slippers. They cluster all over the decorations of the French Empire and it is one of the sadder aspects of Napoleon’s defeat and exile that they disappear from the decorative arts until their rather wan revival under his nephew Napoleon III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What remains in Tournai now however (aside from some reproduction bees) is a too‐good‐to‐be true archaeological museum which lays out everything we can still know about the huge scale of Childeric’s tomb and several associated burials. As his son Clovis turned Christian this was the last of the fabulous, full‐blown pagan Frankish affairs, with 21 cavalry horses buried nearby in an associated mound and what was clearly a sprawling sacred space with Childeric’s body at its center. An aristocratic woman buried nearby slightly later had objects such as scissors, amber and a wine‐strainer which linked her to trade across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the more time spent looking at these shield‐bosses, necklaces and pins (and not least a debonair and alarming scramasax—a wonderful word for a long knife), the more clear it becomes that this was a highly sophisticated, confident civilization—which just happened to exist a very long time ago and whose achievements were about to be completely disregarded by the new Christian regime of Clovis, who moved his capital from Tournai to Paris. The process by which Childeric’s tomb became forgotten cannot be pieced together as his dynastic significance lasted so long. Somehow, the King of the Salian Franks and his favorite horses, his crystal globe, bees, scramasax and all sank into oblivion, eventually disappearing completely under church buildings, until being summoned back to the surface nearly twelve hundred years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quickest way to build beautiful, conversion-optimized payment forms, hosted on Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;important neutral&quot; readability=&quot;3.3793103448276&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overview is for the new version of Stripe Checkout. For the legacy version of Checkout, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/checkout&quot;&gt;Checkout Reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;10.108506363027&quot;&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;6.6666666666667&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;migrating&quot;&gt;Migrating?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/checkout&quot;&gt;legacy version&lt;/a&gt; of Checkout, read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/migration&quot;&gt;Migration Guide&lt;/a&gt; for how to upgrade your integration to use the new version of Checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;beta-user&quot;&gt;Beta user?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are currently on a beta of the new version of Checkout, read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/migration-from-beta&quot;&gt;Beta Migration Guide&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade to the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start accepting payments with just a few lines of code. Checkout is a smart payment page that works seamlessly across devices and is designed to increase your conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout includes support for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment methods:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;credit and debit cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Pay (with no additional setup required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment types:&lt;/strong&gt; one-time and recurring payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; dynamic &lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-content&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure&quot;&gt;3D Secure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;key-popover&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D Secure&lt;/em&gt; provides an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions that protects merchants from liability for fraudulent card payments. During a transaction that incorporates the 3D Secure authorization process, the customer is prompted to supply a separate password or code to validate their purchase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ready for &lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-content&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication&quot;&gt;Strong Customer Authentication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;key-popover&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Customer Authentication&lt;/em&gt; (SCA) is a new regulatory requirement coming into effect on September 14, 2019 which will impact many European online payments. It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization:&lt;/strong&gt; localized for &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-languages-for-stripe-checkout&quot;&gt;14 languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checkout is currently in active development. Visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout#checkout-roadmap&quot;&gt;Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s coming up next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/docs/checkout/overview.gif&quot; class=&quot;zoomable&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/docs/checkout/overview.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;6.3231132075472&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;see-how&quot;&gt;See how it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try out Checkout now by clicking the Preview Checkout button below. This sample integration is running in test mode, which means that it won’t create a real charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use one of Stripe’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/testing&quot;&gt;test card numbers&lt;/a&gt; with any three-digit CVC code and an expiration date in the future to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;&lt;button id=&quot;preview-button&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Preview Checkout&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to integrate with the new version of Checkout. Both integrations support core features, with minor differences. Review the information below to determine which one works best for your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;comparison-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;comparison-table-col&quot;&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;feature-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add products and plans in the Dashboard, then integrate with a client-side snippet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannot associate payments with existing &lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-content&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers&quot;&gt;Customers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;key-popover&quot;&gt;Stripe &lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt; objects allow you to perform recurring charges, and to track multiple charges, that are associated with the same customer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannot use separate authorization and capture for card payments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;No &lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tooltip-content&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/connect&quot;&gt;Connect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;key-popover&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connect&lt;/em&gt; is Stripe’s solution for any business that needs to process payments and pay out to sellers and service providers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;comparison-table-col&quot;&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;feature-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pass in one-time payment information or subscription data from your server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can associate one-time payments with existing Customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/server#separate-auth-capture&quot;&gt;separate authorization and capture&lt;/a&gt; for card payments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Works with Connect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;8.6569872958258&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;supported-languages&quot;&gt;Supported languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Checkout detects the locale of the customer’s browser and displays a translated version of the page in their language if it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-languages-for-stripe-checkout&quot;&gt;supported&lt;/a&gt;. You can also provide a specific locale for Checkout to use instead via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-redirect-to-checkout&quot;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-locale&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; integrations. Checkout also uses the locale to format numbers and currencies. For example, when selling a product whose price is set in EUR with the locale set to auto, a browser configured to use English (en) would see €25.00 while one configured for German (de) would see 25,00 €.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;checkout-roadmap&quot;&gt;Checkout roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, we plan to add more features to Stripe Checkout. Here are some of the features we’re considering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for Google Pay (in addition to Apple Pay, which is already supported)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for coupons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for iDEAL, SEPA Debit, and other European payment methods, with the most relevant payment methods surfaced to the customer based on their country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shipping address support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better support for saving customer details and reusing saved payment methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to pre-fill more customer details, such as contact and shipping information&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Show HN: Applying the Unix philosophy to neural networks</title>
<link>https://github.com/cloudkj/layer</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/cloudkj/layer</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;layer&lt;/code&gt; is a program for doing neural network inference the Unix way. Many modern neural network operations can be represented as sequential, unidirectional streams of data processed by pipelines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt;. The computations at each layer in these neural networks are equivalent to an invocation of the &lt;code&gt;layer&lt;/code&gt; program, and multiple invocations can be chained together to represent the entirety of such networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, performing inference on a neural network with two fully-connected layers might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cat input | layer full -w w.1 --input-shape=2 -f tanh | layer full -w w.2 --input-shape=3 -f sigmoid
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;layer&lt;/code&gt; applies the Unix philosophy to neural network inference. Each type of a neural network layer is a distinct subcommand. Simple text streams of delimited numeric values serve as the interface between different layers of a neural network. Each invocation of &lt;code&gt;layer&lt;/code&gt; does one thing: it feeds the numeric input values forward through an instantiation of a neural network layer, then emits the resulting output numeric values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: a convolutional neural network for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CIFAR-10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ cat cifar10_x.csv \
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; layer convolutional -w w0.csv -b b0.csv --input-shape=32,32,3  --filter-shape=3,3 --num-filters=32 -f relu \
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; layer convolutional -w w1.csv -b b1.csv --input-shape=30,30,32 --filter-shape=3,3 --num-filters=32 -f relu \
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; layer pooling --input-shape=28,28,32 --filter-shape=2,2 --stride=2 -f max
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: a multi-layer perceptron for XOR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Fully connected layer with three neurons&lt;/span&gt;

$ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Fully connected layer with one neuron&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;-5.0625,-3.515625,-5.0625&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; layer2.weights

&lt;li&gt;On macOS 10.3+, BLAS is pre-installed as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/blas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Accelerate framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unzip the release and run &lt;code&gt;[sudo] ./install.sh&lt;/code&gt;, or manually relocate the binaries to the path of your choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;layer&lt;/code&gt; is currently implemented as a proof-of-concept and supports a limited number of neural network layer types. The types of layers are currently limited to feed-forward layers that can be modeled as sequential, unidirectional pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input values, weights and biases for parameterized layers, and output values are all read and written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;row-major order&lt;/a&gt;, based on the shape parameters specified for each layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;layer&lt;/code&gt; is implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.call-cc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CHICKEN Scheme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
