<title>You&amp;#039;ve only added two lines – why did that take two days?</title>
<link>https://www.mrlacey.com/2020/07/youve-only-added-two-lines-why-did-that.html?m=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mrlacey.com/2020/07/youve-only-added-two-lines-why-did-that.html?m=1</guid>
<description>It might seem a reasonable question, but it makes some terrible assumptions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;lines of code = effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lines of code = value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all lines of code are equal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;None of those are true.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why did a fix that seems so simple when looking at the changes made take two days to complete?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because the issue was reported with a vague description of how to recreate it.&lt;/strong&gt; It took me several hours to get to a reliable reproduction of the item. Some developers would have immediately gone back to the person reporting the problem and required more information before investigating. I try and do as much as I can with the information provided. I know some developers don't like having to fix bugs, and so do whatever they can to get out of it. Claiming there isn't enough is a great way to look like you're trying to help but not have to do anything. I know that reporting errors can be hard, and I'm grateful for anyone who does. I want to show appreciation for error reports by trying to do as much as possible with the information provided before asking for more details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because the reported issue was related to functionality, I'm not familiar with.&lt;/strong&gt; The feature it was to do with was something I rarely use and is not something I've ever used in great detail. This meant it took me longer than it might to understand how to use it and the nuances of how it interacts with the software with the bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because I took the time to investigate the real cause of the issue, not just looking at the symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;. If some code is throwing an error, you could just wrap it in a try..catch statement and suppress the error. No error, no problem. Right? Sorry, for me, making the problem invisible isn't the same as fixing it. &quot;Swallowing&quot; an error can easily lead to other unexpected side-effects. I don't want to have to deal with them at a point in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because I investigated if there were other ways of getting to the same problem, not just the reported reproduction steps&lt;/strong&gt;. One set of reproduction steps can easily make the error appear to be in one place when it may actually be more deep-seated. Finding the exact cause of a problem, and looking at all the ways to get there can provide valuable insights. Insights such as how the code is actually used, where there might be other places with possible (other?) problems that might need addressing, or it may show inconsistencies in the code that mean an error is caused (or handled) in one code path but not another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because I took the time to verify if there were other parts of the code that might be affected in similar ways&lt;/strong&gt;. If a mistake led to the bug, the same error could have also been made elsewhere in the code-base. Now's a great time to check. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because when I found the cause of the issue, I looked to find the simplest way of fixing it that would have minimal risk of introducing side-effects&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't want the quickest possible fix. I want a fix that isn't likely to cause confusion or other problems in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because I tested the change thoroughly and verified that it addressed the problem for all the different code paths that were affected&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't want to rely on someone else to have to test that what I've done is correct. I don't want a bug to be found in the future and for me to have to come back to this code when I've mentally moved on. Context switching is expensive and frustrating. Having a dedicated tester have to look at the &quot;same&quot; change again is something I want to avoid whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I don't like having to fix bugs. Partly because they can feel like the result of a previous failure on my part. The other reason I don't like fixing bugs is that I'd prefer to be working on new things.&lt;p&gt;What's worse than having to fix a bug?&lt;br/&gt;Having to fix the same bug repeatedly.&lt;br/&gt;I take the time to make sure any bug is totally fixed any time it is encountered so that it doesn't need to be faced, investigated, fixed, and tested more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>How to Run a Live Coding Stream on Twitch Using OBS</title>
<link>https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/streaming-desk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stream software picture&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this post, you might be interested in trying your hand at live coding on stream, as a way of sharing your projects in a more relatable, immediate way than a polished blog post, teaching others about programming, or just as a way to have fun. I think that live coding and streams in general are an interesting possible future form of both education and entertainment, and if you’re contemplating starting your own stream, I sincerely hope that you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month marks the 6 month anniversary of the first stream on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitch.tv/large__data__bank&quot;&gt;LARGE DATA BANK&lt;/a&gt;, my Twitch live coding channel. It’s grown from a one-off Friday experiment into a regularly scheduled part of my life, a community of dozens of wonderful regular viewers and chatters, and an activity that’s one of the top things I look forward to doing every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned a lot along the way, and this detailed guide to the way I’ve set up my stream is my attempt at stepping back and sharing those learnings in the hopes of inspiring others to try this awesome hobby for themselves. I hope it’s useful for you as you start your own journey into streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions that aren’t answered in this blog post, I’m more than happy to answer them &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JordanALewis&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/&quot;&gt;elsewhere online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, please send me a follow on &lt;a href=&quot;https://largedatabank.com&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JordanALewis&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for stream notifications! I stream every Friday at 3 PM ET, and most Sundays at some time in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;nav id=&quot;TableOfContents&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your reasons for wanting to try streaming, there’s quite a bit of setup that you’ll need to do up front to try it out that can feel daunting. Everyone has to go through this initial setup period, though, and so can you. You got this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of this post is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#obs-configuration&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com&quot;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt;, which is the awesome, cross-platform, free and open source streaming software that most of the community uses. OBS will be your best friend on your streaming journey! You will use it to control your webcam, desktop, audio, and every other element that goes into the final product of your livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the post focuses on configuration that’s more specific to Twitch. I like to use Twitch because I like the culture that’s developed there over time, but plenty of people think that YouTube Live is more appropriate for professional content. I’m not too familiar with YouTube Live, but most of the discussion about OBS should apply the same for YouTube as it does for Twitch: the main difference is that you’ll configure OBS to send to your YouTube account instead of Twitch in Stream settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yo!&lt;/em&gt; If you’re trying to set up your very first stream&lt;/strong&gt;, you really don’t need most of the stuff in this guide, which represents what I’ve built gradually over the past 6 months, stream by stream. My recommendation for the livecoding-curious is to try streaming with a bare-bones setup, to see how you like it, before investing in expensive gear or diving into hours of configuration and asset creation. You can accomplish this in several hours over a weekend. Set up a single scene in OBS with your captured desktop as the background and your webcam in the corner, with your microphone configured under Mic/Aux. That’s all you need: a simple setup for streaming your coding is now yours! I’ll cover how to make that happen below, in the OBS Configuration section. Just ignore most of the extra scenes and various bells and whistles, and you’ll be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com&quot;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; is where you’ll produce everything that your viewers can see and hear on the live video, including your desktop, the camera with your beautiful face on it, your voice, and any stream alerts, overlays, text, or other information that you might want to show to your viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktop2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to cover with OBS and I’m not going to try to explain all of it, so I’ll just talk about what’s worked for me. To make something that suits you, you’ll need to flex your creative muscles! You can use the ideas here as a starting place, but you’ll need to dive into OBS and play around: everyone’s setup is going to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scenes&quot;&gt;Scenes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;scene&lt;/em&gt; is OBS’s name for a particular layout of video and audio components on a stream. Typically, you’ll see Twitch streamers stay on a single scene for most of their stream: their game, desktop, or whatever their focus is. But it’s handy to have a few extra ones for the intro and outro to your stream, something that covers the screen for when you want to take a break, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/scenes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Scenes popped out&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the main scenes that I use bound to global hotkeys, so I can switch between them without having to click around in OBS. Unfortunately, sometimes the hotkeys stop working during the stream - I’ve yet to figure out exactly why this happens. If you happen to have this same problem and have found a workaround, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 6 primary scenes, and a couple of child scenes that are embedded in several main scenes to deduplicate on-screen elements (the ones below the &lt;code&gt;-----&lt;/code&gt; in the picture). However, I spend the vast majority of my stream on one of them: the Desktop scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;desktop&quot;&gt;Desktop &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scene is the workhorse of the stream, and the one that’s active 95% of the time. It consists of a full-screen, 1080p Display Capture source of my external monitor. This is convenient because it leaves no ambiguity about what’s catpured on the stream (it’s the whole monitor) and leaves my laptop screen free for the OBS window, monitoring chat, and anything else that I want to look at while streaming without having to show my viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020&quot;&gt;Desktop setup post&lt;/a&gt; goes into more detail about the way that I’ve set up my desk to have two monitors. It’s so convenient for the stream that I’m hooked, and I’m not sure how I’d manage without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/desktopscene.png&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop Scene in OBS&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note on font size: you have to make your text editor font quite large to make it legible for your viewers! It will take a little while to get used to this. I use 26-point font in my editor, which provides only about 30 visible horizontal lines of code. This is next to nothing compared to the amount of context you’re probably used to seeing while programming. This hamstringing is worth it, though: the bigger your font, the more likely it is that your viewers will be able to follow along with what you’re doing, stay engaged, ask questions, learn, and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also try to remove as many distracting elements from your editor and desktop as possible while streaming, to keep the focus on the code. For me, this has meant disabling the Mac’s menubar and Dock, and removing the vast majority of toolbars from my IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the desktop capture source, which is at the back of the scene, I’ve added several other sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Face cam, which is a video source from my capture card (more information about the video sources in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#video&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt; section)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard cam, which is a video source from a webcam pointed at my keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of text boxes, to show my most recent subscriber, follower, and some on-stream commands. The text boxes are updated automatically by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/streamlabels&quot;&gt;StreamLabels&lt;/a&gt; app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web page source connected to Streamlabs Stream Alerts, which I’ll cover &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#stream-alerts&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I definitely didn’t start with all of these elements - it’s quite a lot of work to tweak things just the way you want - but I’ve kept this configuration for the past couple of months and I like the way it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whiteboard&quot;&gt;Whiteboard &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whiteboard scene is meant to showcase my iPad full screen, allowing me to draw things on stream to demonstrate ideas or concepts. I use the Concepts app on the iPad along with an Apple Pencil for drawing, and it works pretty nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/whiteboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Whiteboard scene&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know how to fill up the space on the bottom left, since the iPad doesn’t have a widescreen aspect ratio like my monitor does, so I put a picture that my friend Aileen drew of me to make the stream a bit more visually interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scene references the same facecam and alerts source as the Desktop scene. You can definitely use DRY principles in OBS, just like software - but it does get tricky to keep everything de-duplicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ipad-green-screen-overlay&quot;&gt;iPad Green Screen Overlay &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also set up a “green screen” configuration for the iPad that I can overlay over any other scene with a global hotkey. This gives me the ESPN football announcer effect during my stream: I can draw on my iPad, and the lines will appear overlayed on top of whatever else I have on stream at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most complex video element on my stream, but OBS makes it pretty simple to set up. I added a Color Key filter with a black background on top of the raw iPad video feed, set my drawing app to have a black background, and tweaked the Color Key settings in OBS until things looked right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/colorkey.png&quot; alt=&quot;iPad Color Key&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t use this element as nearly as often as I’d like, but I think it’s pretty neat. I recorded a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4WJQmN1cSo&quot;&gt;demo video&lt;/a&gt; of it if you’re curious for how it looks - I also use it occasionally on the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;selfie&quot;&gt;Selfie &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a full-screen version of the facecam. I copied the name of the scene from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21&quot;&gt;@noopkat’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/selfie.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selfie scene&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this scene for “turn to the camera” moments, which I find really fun. I’ll switch to the scene, look right at the camera, and talk for a bit before switching back to the desktop view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;starting-soon&quot;&gt;Starting Soon &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scene goes on as soon as the stream turns on, until I’m ready to start talking to the camera. I’ll usually start the stream a few minutes before the time that I announced on Twitter for my stream, and leave it up until that time comes (with a muted mic!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/startingsoon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Starting Soon scene&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a gif I found on the internet of someone typing, so people can tell that the stream is live even though there’s nothing happening yet. There’s also music during this “pre-roll”. I’ll talk about music and sound &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#audio&quot;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;brb&quot;&gt;BRB &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll put this scene on if I need to step away from the stream for a moment to use the bathroom or whatever. I added a sound to it as well, which I think is kind of funny - when I switch to the scene, it’ll play the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uleM9ZNTE34&quot;&gt;“be right back”&lt;/a&gt; sound - I’m not sure where this sound is from but I think it’s a meme :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scene also has a gif so that people know the stream is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/brb.png&quot; alt=&quot;BRB scene&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bye&quot;&gt;Bye &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending your stream is straightforward: you click the Stop Streaming button in OBS. Rather than cutting directly from Desktop to the stream being over, it’s nice to switch the video to a goodbye scene, so people know that you’re about to stop the broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, I drew a little goodbye picture on my iPad. I try to remember to put this on before I end the stream, but it’s easy to forget: there’s a lot to try to pack in right at the end! I try to talk right at the camera, thank people for stopping by, and recap the stream, but I also typically try to find a streamer to raid at the same time (Twitch’s term for sending your viewers to another stream when you’re ready to stop), which adds a bunch of extra mental overhead. All of this adds up to sometimes forgetting to toggle the “Bye” scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/bye.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bye scene&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;Video &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a bunch of settings you’ll need to tweak in OBS, but probably the most important ones will be your Video and Output settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Video settings control the Canvas and Output resolutions (the size of the stream canvas on your computer, and the resolution that OBS will send to Twitch). The bigger the output resolution, the more bandwidth you’ll need to stream, and the more bandwidth your viewers will need to watch. The most popular streamers get “quality options” from Twitch, which allows viewers to watch at a lower quality, but most streamers don’t get options - the viewers have to watch at the same resolution that the streamer streams at. And, if your canvas resolution differs from your output resolution, OBS will need to apply a downscaling filter, adding to the CPU load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this to say, I set both resolutions to 720p! It seems like a good mix of bandwidth and quality to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/videosettings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Video settings&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Output settings control the behavior of the encoder, and must be tuned to provide the right mix of quality and CPU use. Generally, the higher the bitrate, the better your stream will look, but the more network bandwidth and CPU OBS will consume. You’ll want to find a mix that works for you. Here’s what I use, but of course, YMMV and you should experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/outputsettings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Output settings&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to test this stuff is to record sample videos and examine them, as well as to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://inspector.twitch.tv/&quot;&gt;Twitch Inspector&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you a modified &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#streaming-to-twitch-finally&quot;&gt;Stream Key&lt;/a&gt; that you can configure OBS with. Once you start streaming with the modified key, you’ll be able to monitor your upload bandwidth and the bitrate that you can sustainably send to Twitch via the Inspector website, without having to actually go live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/inspector.png&quot; alt=&quot;Twitch Inspector&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph is from a recent stream that I had to cut off due to internet issues, which I think were caused by the intense storm that was rolling through Brooklyn at that time. You can see there are several instabilities in the graph, and some “unstable” events. A good, stable stream will have zero or few blips in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One slight annoyance with the Inspector is that it only gives you your bitrate and bandwidth, in a graph: it doesn’t actually let you play the stream back to make sure it looks good. If you’re just getting started and really want to test out the pipeline end to end, you can set up a private or unlisted YouTube Live broadcast and stream to that. That will let you see your video during or after your test stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;camera&quot;&gt;Camera &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3294YlO&quot;&gt;Sony a6400&lt;/a&gt; camera with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3iYb4LG&quot;&gt;Sigma 30mm f/1.4&lt;/a&gt; lens to capture my visage. You &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; don’t need such a high quality camera to get started streaming with, but if you’ve got one, you might as well use it! The quality will be immediately noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever camera you use, you’ll probably want to make sure you have some nice light shining on your beautiful face! The easiest way to do this is to stream during the day: sunlight makes everyone look good. If you’re streaming at night, you’ll need to figure out lighting in a different way. I talk about the cheapo DIY softbox I use in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020/#lighting&quot;&gt;desk setup post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/desk/sony.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;camera setup&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16.786795048143&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: if you’re not using a USB webcam or the camera on your laptop, you’ll need a capture card to convert your camera’s HDMI output into a video stream for OBS to use. I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ATcRAx&quot;&gt;AVerMedia Live Gamer Portable 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which while hideous and rather large, does the trick. It also has pass through HDMI, which gives me the option of capturing a game console if I ever decide to stream something that isn’t programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to note about the capture card is that it does introduce some latency between what the camera sees and the output stream in OBS. To compensate for this, I added artificial latency to my microphone to match the capture card’s latency. I’ll talk about this later, in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#audio&quot;&gt;audio section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2OiKteb&quot;&gt;Logitech C922&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fabulous, affordable webcam. After I upgraded to the fancier Sony, I figured I’d put the Logitech to good use by pointing it at my handsome keyboard and letting viewers see the soothing, soothing ASMR effect of my hands tapping keys during my stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this, but it adds a little bit of extra mental load to make sure that I remember to not type passwords! I’ve leaked some unimportant passwords a couple of times this way (though not sure if anyone has taken the time to try to figure them out from the video), so hopefully at this point I’ve learned my lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;audio&quot;&gt;Audio &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound is the other really important component of a stream, besides the video. Your viewers want to hear your silky smooth voice, and depending on what you’re trying to do on stream, might also want to hear the sound from whatever you’re doing on your computer. I also like to include a low volume of background music on my stream, to ease the transition to silence if I have to take some moments to think about what I’m doing. It’s also a common touch to add a sound to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#stream-alerts&quot;&gt;stream alerts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBS has several places to configure audio, but you’ll want to start with adding your microphone (Yeti Stereo Microphone, in my case) to the Mic/Aux dropdown in Audio settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/soundsettings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sound settings&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;microphone&quot;&gt;Microphone &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3enL1dl&quot;&gt;Blue Yeti&lt;/a&gt; mic, which is a popular choice and a good mix of price and quality. I have it mounted to my desk with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/300NSE8&quot;&gt;boom arm&lt;/a&gt;, so I can bring the microphone close to my face without it getting in the way of my keyboard, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2BWkjM1&quot;&gt;shock absorber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3082aCG&quot;&gt;pop filter&lt;/a&gt; to avoid distracting sibilant noises and vibrations from any furious typing or desk bumps that might ensue. I wrote about this more in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/desk-setup-2020&quot;&gt;desk setup post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of bringing the mic close to your face with a boom is that it allows you to lower the gain on the microphone to avoid noises that are not your voice. Even with a low gain, though, the microphone is very sensitive, and it’ll pick up noises like fans, air conditioners, or your partner’s phone calls. OBS has several filters that you can apply to your Microphone input to help suppress this background noise, like Compressor, Expander, Limiter, and Noise Suppression. There’s a lot of discussion about this on the OBS forums and around the web that I won’t rehash, but after copious testing with different settings and levels of background noise, I’ve come to the conclusion that the best filter for me is the Noise Suppression filter at -20 dB. This will almost certainly be different for you - try things out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;syncing-audio-to-video&quot;&gt;Syncing Audio to Video &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you test your stream out, if you notice that there’s an issue with the synchronization between your mouth moving in your video and the sound of your speech, you can tweak that in the Advanced Audio Properties settings in OBS. I had to add 130ms delay from my microphone to compensate for the latency of the capture card that I use for my webcam - of course, this will vary depending on your setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/advancedaudiosettings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Advanced audio settings&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that I test this is by using the Start Recording feature in OBS, and recording myself clapping several times. Then, I open the video in VLC and play it back in slow motion, trying to line up the sharp sound of the clap with the image of my hands hitting each other. It’s kind of hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I think about it, this must be why movie producers use those iconic clapboards and not their hands - it’s probably much easier to see exactly when the two halves of the clapboard hit each other than two hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;desktop-sound-capture&quot;&gt;Desktop Sound Capture &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that getting desktop capture sound right on OBS on Mac is kind of a pain. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower&quot;&gt;SoundFlower&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open source kernel extension that allows you to set your audio output to a device that programs can then use as an input source. This allows OBS to listen to all of your computer’s sound output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to also listen to that same desktop sound, you’ll need to make an “aggregate device” in the Audio MIDI Setup program, and include both your headphones and the Soundflower device. Then, you’ll set your computer’s output device to that new aggregate device you’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can shell out the $99 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/&quot;&gt;Loopback&lt;/a&gt; from Rogue Amoeba, which does all of this (and more) in a much easier way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, once you get this all set up, you’ll want to add your Soundflower or Loopback output device as your Desktop Audio device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you’ll be able to see the levels for both of these devices in the Audio Mixer at the bottom of your stream and adjust them on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;streaming-to-twitch-finally&quot;&gt;Streaming to Twitch (finally) &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, you’ve tweaked OBS to your liking, set up your webcam and microphone, and created some scenes. Now, how do you actually go ahead and start streaming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, you’ll need to create your Twitch account, if you don’t have one already. The Twitch documentation is quite good, according to my expert tech writer colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://amrutaranade.com/&quot;&gt;Amruta&lt;/a&gt;, so you should check out their &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/creating-an-account-with-twitch&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got your account set up, you’ll need to find your Stream Key on the Twitch website and enter it into OBS’s Stream settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/streamsettings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stream settings&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that’s done, all you have to do to start your live stream is to take a deep breath, smile at the camera, and hit the Start Streaming button in OBS. That’s it: now you’re live! Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stream alerts are a fun way of encouraging people to follow or subscribe to your channel. When someone follows, subscribes, gifts a sub, raids or hosts your stream, or sends bits, having a stream alert configured will play a gif, a sound, and display the name of the person who performed the action along with the thing that they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://streamlabs.com/&quot;&gt;StreamLabs&lt;/a&gt; Alert Box for my stream alerts. It’s very easy to use, and free. Once you’ve configured the alert box on the StreamLabs website, you add it to your stream as a Browser source. When somebody interacts with your stream, StreamLabs will send the alert to the webpage that the source is pointing at, and it’ll do its thing. This is less confusing than it sounds, and StreamLabs has pretty good instructions on their site for how to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My follower alert looks like this (on stream, the blue background is transparent):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/followalert.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Follow alert&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a lot of fun with these! I picked a bunch of different gifs for each alert type, and to further personalize things, I found some movie quotes on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quodb.com/&quot;&gt;QuoDB&lt;/a&gt; where people say something related to data banks, found clips of them online, and created mp3s to play when people subscribe. You can also have StreamLabs play a random mp3 from a set, to keep things fresh as people follow or sub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sound-in-stream-alerts&quot;&gt;Sound in Stream Alerts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides just being exciting for your viewers, stream alerts also serve another purpose: to make a noise so that you know to react to the exciting follow, sub or raid that just came your way! There’s just one problem, though, which is that you need to make the alert play both to your stream and into your headphones, without playing twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is troublesome if you’re doing desktop audio capture! By default, the Browser source will play audio directly into the stream’s mix, and not output locally. This sounds good for your viewers, but not for you, the streamer. For you to be able to hear the alert yourself while streaming, you’ll need to check the “Control Audio via OBS” box in the Browser source, and then set the Audio Monitoring dropdown in Advanced Audio Properties to “Monitor and Output” (you can see this in action in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#audio&quot;&gt;audio section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will output both to your stream and to your configured Monitor audio out. Careful, though - if your monitor audio out is the same audio output that’s getting captured by Soundflower or Loopback, your viewers will hear a doubled sound. To avoid this, make sure your Monitoring device is set to your headphones in OBS’s Audio Settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gotten your stream going, you’ll probably want to use Twitch’s tools to fill out your page to help give your stream a unique look and branding, and to help viewers understand what your stream is about. There are a several things to take care of here, and just like the rest of this setup, you’ll probably want to start simple here and enhance it over time as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitch gives every stream an opportunity to list its category. Since Twitch started as and is still primarily a gaming website, most of the categories are individual games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several non-gaming categories. The one that live coders use is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Science%20%26%20Technology&quot;&gt;Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;, so I use that as well. The category is also a great way of finding other programming streamers to watch, get inspired by, or learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitch also allows you to give your stream &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guide-to-tags&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt;, which are a further way to aid stream discovery and help viewers know what your stream is about. I always tag my stream with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/a59f1e4e-257b-4bd0-90c7-189c3efbf917&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/cea7bc0c-75a5-4446-8743-6db031b71550&quot;&gt;Educational&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/dff0aca6-52fe-4cc4-a93a-194852b522f0&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/6f86127d-6051-4a38-94bb-f7b475dde109&quot;&gt;Software Development&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/6ea6bca4-4712-4ab9-a906-e3336a9d8039&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s somewhat hard to tell where viewers come from via Twitch’s analytics, but for reference, here’s the viewer breakdown from one of my recent streams. I believe the recommendations and browse page views probably came up because of my stream’s categories and tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/views.png&quot; alt=&quot;analytics example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;panels&quot;&gt;Panels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panels are Twitch’s way of giving your channel an “about” section. Each panel can have an image and some text. It’s a fairly annoying abstraction, to be honest: each panel image has to be a fixed size, and you don’t have that much control of how they’re all laid out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/panels.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panels&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go text only, but most streams have some images to give the stream a unified look and feel. I’d eventually like to pay an artist to make some themed panels and emotes for me, but for now I found some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/gallery/28221943/FREE-Twitch-Panel-Theme-Packs&quot;&gt;free panel images&lt;/a&gt; on Behance that I liked from someone named Anibal Alvarez. Thanks, Anibal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;emotes&quot;&gt;Emotes &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add custom emotes for your subscribers to use in any chat on Twitch if you become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate.twitch.tv&quot;&gt;Twitch Affiliate&lt;/a&gt;. Emotes are the lingua franca of expressing feelings on Twitch, and a great way of demonstrating your support for a channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people like to commission themed emotes for their channels from an artist. I’d like to do that at some point, but until then, I’ve uploaded a funny picture of myself that someone added to my work Slack in the image of the Ancient Aliens guy. See the resemblance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/ancient.png&quot; alt=&quot;ancient jordan&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;banner-image&quot;&gt;Banner image &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a slot for a banner image on Twitch, which is yet another asset that you’ll probably want to generate to avoid the default banner look, which is your Twitch name laid out in a repeating pattern on a plain, colored background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Preview.app to make mine, and the result is predictably amateur. I really want to replace this image soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/banner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Banner&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far in the post, and can figure out who the person in the banner is and how he relates to the title of my stream, congratulations! You are a nerd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;saving-videos&quot;&gt;Saving Videos &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other important thing to note is that, by default, Twitch will not archive your stream as videos! You need to turn this setting on. It’s located in the Channel settings page of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.twitch.tv/&quot;&gt;Creator Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/images/stream/storebroadcasts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Store past broadcasts setting&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve enabled this setting, the video from your stream will be saved on Twitch’s servers for a few weeks. Each video has a handy dandy Export button, which allows you to permanently save your videos on YouTube (or download them if you want to do that for some reason). I export all of my videos to YouTube, trim out the intro and outro, and add them to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLusTLTHkFrR240f5qGJhywJuLDSxCBm_n&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/a&gt; for archival purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You end up with a lot of YouTube content quickly with this method, and I’m not exactly sure whether it’s super useful to save the hours and hours of content that you create streaming raw to YouTube, but most of my stream videos get several views over time so I imagine somebody must find them useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your stream starts accumulating viewers, you’ll probably start to notice that there are some frequently asked questions that new viewers have that start to get tiresome to answer over and over again. Most channels have a chatbot set up with commands that you or viewers can type to get the answer to these FAQs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my channel, people love to ask what my current project is, what kind of keyboard I have (I’m kind of asking for this one because I have a webcam pointing at it all the time), and what my editor is and what color scheme it uses. So, I have commands for all of these: you can type &lt;code&gt;!project&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!keyboard&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!editor&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;!theme&lt;/code&gt; into the chat and the bot will respond with the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of Twitch bots out there. I like to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://nightbot.tv&quot;&gt;Nightbot&lt;/a&gt;, which has a good mix of features and is free and very easy to use. People love to make their own Twitch bots as well (I notice that it’s one of the most common projects that people do on their programming channels, actually), but I haven’t needed anything more fancy than what Nightbot provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitch has an Affiliate program that you can apply for if your channel hits certain viewership and followership metrics. Becoming an Affiliate unlocks several features for your stream, most signifiantly allowing viewers to subscribe to your channel for a monthly fee, which grants them &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/#emotes&quot;&gt;emotes&lt;/a&gt; to use in any chat room on Twitch, and the good feeling of supporting a streamer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affiliate streams also get a couple of other features for their streams, like Channel Points, which are a currency that you accumulate while watching the stream and can redeem for streamer-defined rewards. I haven’t tried playing around with Channel Points yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to affiliate will require some work: you need to have 50 followers, an average of 3 concurrent viewers per stream, and 500 total broadcast minutes over at least 7 streams in the past 30 days. But, you can definitely do this if you put your mind to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about 4 months to become a Twitch Affiliate. The hardest requirement for me was hitting 7 streams a month, which implies needing to stream more than once per week. When I started, I was streaming every Friday, and one stream per week is already quite a bit of mental effort! I added a Sunday stream as well, basically just so I could hit affiliate, but doing it twice a week adds up in time and energy for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t expecting this from the outset, but I found that seeing my friends, colleagues, and random strangers subscribe to me in support of my stream is a really wonderful feeling! It motivates me to try hard to make a fun stream every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to shout out &lt;a href=&quot;https://noopkat.com/projects/&quot;&gt;@noopkat&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@suzhinton/my-twitch-live-coding-setup-b2516672fb21&quot;&gt;awesome post&lt;/a&gt; about her streaming setup as well. It’s what helped me get started in Februrary and is another fantastic resource for getting started streaming programming on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the other streamers who I’ve collaborated with while creating this setup: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitch.tv/onetruecaptain&quot;&gt;OneTrueCaptain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitch.tv/jarsonmar&quot;&gt;jarsonmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitch.tv/mdlayher&quot;&gt;mdlayher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/its_jay_phillz&quot;&gt;its_jay_phillz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitch.tv/occupy_paul_st&quot;&gt;occupy_paul_st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to everyone who has joined the stream to watch, chat, follow, jeer, or subscribe to my channel: it’s a great motivator and your support means a lot! It obviously wouldn’t be fun without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to subscribers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://amrutaranade.com/&quot;&gt;Amruta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://charlieharrington.com&quot;&gt;Charlie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://justinjaffray.com&quot;&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulkernfeld.com/&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;, and Sean for reviewing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, thanks to Becca Rohrer for putting up with me yelling at the computer in our shared “office room” for hours and hours twice a week, especially during quarantine. This must be extremely annoying. Thank you for your gracious tolerance and support of this hobby of mine. I love you!&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How to Run a Live Coding Stream on Twitch using OBS</og:title>
<og:description>If you’re reading this post, you might be interested in trying your hand at live coding on stream, as a way of sharing your projects in a more relatable, immediate way than a polished blog post, teaching others about programming, or just as a way to have fun. I think that live coding and streams in general are an interesting possible future form of both education and entertainment, and if you’re contemplating starting your own stream, I sincerely hope that you do it.</og:description>

<title>Etcd, or, why modern software makes me sad</title>
<link>https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/07/etcd-or-why-modern-software-makes-me-sad/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/07/etcd-or-why-modern-software-makes-me-sad/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;etcd icon&quot; class=&quot;rfloat&quot; src=&quot;https://www.roguelazer.com/images/etcd-icon.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time in 2013, there was a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://etcd.io/&quot;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt; which was a really lightweight database written around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/raft-atc14&quot;&gt;Raft&lt;/a&gt; consensus algorithm. This tool was originally written in 2013 for a &lt;del&gt;bullshit&lt;/del&gt; unsuccessful project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/&quot;&gt;CoreOS Container Linux&lt;/a&gt; that was EOL'd several years ago, but that doesn't really matter — etcd was greater than its original use-case. Etcd provided a convenient and simple set of primitives (set a key, get a key, set-only-if-unchanged, watch-for-changes) with a drop-dead simple HTTP API on top of them. I have built a number of tools using etcd as a lightweight consensus store behind them and it's absolutely a pleasure to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, an unrelated tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; was released by Google (but, really, by Xooglers). I would go so far as to say that Kubernetes (or, as the &quot;cool kids&quot; say, &lt;kbd&gt;k8s&lt;/kbd&gt;) is the worst thing to happen to system administration since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/03/systemd/&quot;&gt;systemd&lt;/a&gt;. It's a comprehensive suite that promises to simplify operating clusters of software and give something like the experience of Google's &lt;kbd&gt;borg&lt;/kbd&gt; cluster manager. What it really does is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add hundreds of new failure modes to your software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move you from writing portable software configuration to writing thousands of lines of k8s-specific YAML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensnare you in a mesh of questionably-good&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:questionably-good&quot;/&gt; patterns like containerization and software defined networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are running a truly enormous system and want to have off-the-shelf orchestration for it, Kubernetes may be the tool for you. For 99.9% of people out there, it's just an extra layer of complexity that adds almost nothing of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I digress, though; this is a story about etcd. And, unfortunately, our stories come together because Kubernetes was quickly changed to use etcd as its state store. Thus began the rapid decline of etcd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the massive influx of Kubernetes users came, of course, a large number of Xooglers who decided to infect etcd with Google technologies, as is their way&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:infection&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:who&quot;/&gt;. Etcd's simple HTTP API was replaced by a &quot;gRPC&quot;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:grpc&quot;/&gt; version; the simple internal data model was replaced by a dense and non-orthogonal data model with different types for leases, locks, transactions, and plain-old-keys. etcd 3.2 added back a tiny subset of the HTTP API through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway/&quot;&gt;&quot;gRPC Gateway&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, but not enough to implement any of the rich applications built on top of the original API. The v2 API lives on for now, but upstream threatens to remove it in every new version and there will surely come a time when it'll be removed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the story. Popular modern technology is taken over by expats from a megacorp and made worse in the service of a hyper-specialized (and just plain over-hyped) orchestration platform. That's the world today. Anything that has a simple and elegant feature-set ends up coöpted by people who just want to build big ungainly architecture and ends up inheriting features from whatever megacorp the coöpters came from&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:megacorp&quot;/&gt;. The software development world would prefer to use their multi-gigabyte IDEs running on ElectronJS to build thousand-dependency Java applications targeting ungainly APIs on hard-to-operate systems than support something simpler and better. Quality is, alas, a dying art.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Once upon a time in 2013, there was a tool called etcd which was a really lightweight database written around the Raft consensus algorithm. This tool was originally written in 2013 for a bullshit unsuccessful project called CoreOS Container Linux that was EOL'd several years ago, but that doesn't really matter — etcd was greater than its original use-case. Etcd provided a convenient and simple set of primitives (set a key, get a key, set-only-if-unchanged, watch-for-changes) with a drop-dead simple HTTP API on top of them. I have built a number of tools using etcd as a lightweight consensus store behind …</og:description>

<title>Resignation Letter</title>
<link>https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dear A.G.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is with sadness that I write to tell you that I am resigning from The New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I joined the paper with gratitude and optimism three years ago. I was hired with the goal of bringing in voices that would not otherwise appear in your pages: first-time writers, centrists, conservatives and others who would not naturally think of The Times as their home. The reason for this effort was clear: The paper’s failure to anticipate the outcome of the 2016 election meant that it didn’t have a firm grasp of the country it covers. Dean Baquet and others have admitted as much on various occasions. The priority in Opinion was to help redress that critical shortcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I was honored to be part of that effort, led by James Bennet. I am proud of my work as a writer and as an editor. Among those I helped bring to our pages: the Venezuelan dissident Wuilly Arteaga; the Iranian chess champion Dorsa Derakhshani; and the Hong Kong Christian democrat Derek Lam. Also: Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Masih Alinejad, Zaina Arafat, Elna Baker, Rachael Denhollander, Matti Friedman, Nick Gillespie, Heather Heying, Randall Kennedy, Julius Krein, Monica Lewinsky, Glenn Loury, Jesse Singal, Ali Soufan, Chloe Valdary, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Wesley Yang, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;But the lessons that ought to have followed the election—lessons about the importance of understanding other Americans, the necessity of resisting tribalism, and the centrality of the free exchange of ideas to a democratic society—have not been learned. Instead, a new consensus has emerged in the press, but perhaps especially at this paper: that truth isn’t a process of collective discovery, but an orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job is to inform everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has become its ultimate editor. As the ethics and mores of that platform have become those of the paper, the paper itself has increasingly become a kind of performance space. Stories are chosen and told in a way to satisfy the narrowest of audiences, rather than to allow a curious public to read about the world and then draw their own conclusions. I was always taught that journalists were charged with writing the first rough draft of history. Now, history itself is one more ephemeral thing molded to fit the needs of a predetermined narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views. They have called me a Nazi and a racist; I have learned to brush off comments about how I’m “writing about the Jews again.” Several colleagues perceived to be friendly with me were badgered by coworkers. My work and my character are openly demeaned on company-wide Slack channels where masthead editors regularly weigh in. There, some coworkers insist I need to be rooted out if this company is to be a truly “inclusive” one, while others post ax emojis next to my name. Still other New York Times employees publicly smear me as a liar and a bigot on Twitter with no fear that harassing me will be met with appropriate action. They never are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are terms for all of this: unlawful discrimination, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge. I’m no legal expert. But I know that this is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I do not understand how you have allowed this kind of behavior to go on inside your company in full view of the paper’s entire staff and the public. And I certainly can’t square how you and other Times leaders have stood by while simultaneously praising me in private for my courage. Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Part of me wishes I could say that my experience was unique. But the truth is that intellectual curiosity—let alone risk-taking—is now a liability at The Times. Why edit something challenging to our readers, or write something bold only to go through the numbing process of making it ideologically kosher, when we can assure ourselves of job security (and clicks) by publishing our 4000th op-ed arguing that Donald Trump is a unique danger to the country and the world? And so self-censorship has become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;What rules that remain at The Times are applied with extreme selectivity. If a person’s ideology is in keeping with the new orthodoxy, they and their work remain unscrutinized. Everyone else lives in fear of the digital thunderdome. Online venom is excused so long as it is directed at the proper targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Op-eds that would have easily been published just two years ago would now get an editor or a writer in serious trouble, if not fired. If a piece is perceived as likely to inspire backlash internally or on social media, the editor or writer avoids pitching it. If she feels strongly enough to suggest it, she is quickly steered to safer ground. And if, every now and then, she succeeds in getting a piece published that does not explicitly promote progressive causes, it happens only after every line is carefully massaged, negotiated and caveated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It took the paper two days and two jobs to say that the Tom Cotton op-ed “fell short of our standards.” We attached an editor’s note on a travel story about Jaffa shortly after it was published because it “failed to touch on important aspects of Jaffa’s makeup and its history.” But there is still none appended to Cheryl Strayed’s fawning interview with the writer Alice Walker, a proud anti-Semite who believes in lizard Illuminati. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people. This is a galaxy in which, to choose just a few recent examples, the Soviet space program is lauded for its “diversity”; the doxxing of teenagers in the name of justice is condoned; and the worst caste systems in human history includes the United States alongside Nazi Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even now, I am confident that most people at The Times do not hold these views. Yet they are cowed by those who do. Why? Perhaps because they believe the ultimate goal is righteous. Perhaps because they believe that they will be granted protection if they nod along as the coin of our realm—language—is degraded in service to an ever-shifting laundry list of right causes. Perhaps because there are millions of unemployed people in this country and they feel lucky to have a job in a contracting industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or perhaps it is because they know that, nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back. Too wise to post on Slack, they write to me privately about the “new McCarthyism” that has taken root at the paper of record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;All this bodes ill, especially for independent-minded young writers and editors paying close attention to what they’ll have to do to advance in their careers. Rule One: Speak your mind at your own peril. Rule Two: Never risk commissioning a story that goes against the narrative. Rule Three: Never believe an editor or publisher who urges you to go against the grain. Eventually, the publisher will cave to the mob, the editor will get fired or reassigned, and you’ll be hung out to dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For these young writers and editors, there is one consolation. As places like The Times and other once-great journalistic institutions betray their standards and lose sight of their principles, Americans still hunger for news that is accurate, opinions that are vital, and debate that is sincere. I hear from these people every day. “An independent press is not a liberal ideal or a progressive ideal or a democratic ideal. It’s an American ideal,” you said a few years ago. I couldn’t agree more. America is a great country that deserves a great newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;None of this means that some of the most talented journalists in the world don’t still labor for this newspaper. They do, which is what makes the illiberal environment especially heartbreaking. I will be, as ever, a dedicated reader of their work. But I can no longer do the work that you brought me here to do—the work that Adolph Ochs described in that famous 1896 statement: “to make of the columns of The New York Times a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ochs’s idea is one of the best I’ve encountered. And I’ve always comforted myself with the notion that the best ideas win out. But ideas cannot win on their own. They need a voice. They need a hearing. Above all, they must be backed by people willing to live by them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bari&lt;/p&gt;

<title>German court bans Tesla ad statements related to autonomous driving</title>
<link>https://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN24F1T5</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN24F1T5</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany has banned Tesla from repeating what a court says are misleading advertising statements relating to the capabilities of the firm’s driver assistance systems and to autonomous driving, a Munich judge ruled on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla can appeal the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was brought by Germany’s Wettbewerbszentrale, an industry sponsored body tasked with policing anti-competitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Munich court agreed with the industry body’s assessment and banned Tesla Germany from including “full potential for autonomous driving” and “Autopilot inclusive” in its German advertising materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said such claims amounted to misleading business practices, adding that the average buyer might be given the impression that the car could drive without human intervention and might suggest such a system was now legal on German roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s autopilot system has drawn criticism from regulators, including from the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States, saying it lacks safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns have grown about assistance systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, tempting drivers to neglect their obligation to be in control of their vehicles at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla has said it has informed customers that its automated driver assistance technology did not amount to a fully autonomous driving system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Tesla Germany was not immediately available to comment on Tuesday’s ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s Chief Executive Elon Musk said this month the electric car manufacturer was close to making its cars capable of automated driving without any need for driver input, so-called Level 5 autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;23.990800367985&quot;&gt;Hello friends,
&lt;p&gt;I'm a Full Stack Developer from India. I'm a maintainer at Gatsby, Open Sauced and Triager at ExpressJS, Nest.land, JSHttp etc. I use GitHub a lot, but recently my account got suspended midnight without any notice, From my knowledge I haven't spammed GitHub, I review 3 - 6 PRs in Gatsby per day, It's been a week without GitHub, I have three sponsors in GitHub, they are asking me tons of questions and one of my sponsor stopped sponsoring me (my payout balance got reduced). All of my office work got stopped, I'm the admin of the org that is used in our company. All employees now don't have access to the repo because it is returning 404. I got support from lot of people in Twitter but GitHub is not responding to my ticket for a week. I also created a petition is change.org &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/github-inc-my-github-account-suspended-for-no-reason&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.change.org/p/github-inc-my-github-account-suspen...&lt;/a&gt; some people supported me over there too. It would be great if GitHub unsuspends me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My support ticket number: 763327&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Profile: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://github.com/yg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save Open source developers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope Nat Friedman and GitHub will see this!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The TikTok War</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, as the idea of banning TikTok in the U.S. has shifted from a fringe idea to a seeming inevitability (thanks in no small part to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/india-bans-chinese-apps-the-app-store-firewall-reddit-and-the-donald/&quot;&gt;India’s decision to do just that&lt;/a&gt;), those opposed to the idea and those in support seem to be talking past each other. The reasons for this disconnect go beyond the usual divisions in tech, culture, and national security: what makes TikTok so unique is that it is the culmination of two trends: one about humans and the Internet, and the other about China and ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Analog World&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always tricky to look at the analog world if you are trying to understand the digital one. When it comes to designing products, a pattern you see repeatedly is copying what came before, poorly, and only later creating something native to the medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider text: given that newspapers monetized by placing advertisements next to news stories, the first websites tried to monetize by — you guessed it — placing advertisements next to news stories. This worked, but not particularly well; publishers talked about print dollars and digital dimes, and later mobile pennies. Sure, the Internet drew attention, but it just didn’t monetize well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed was the feed, something uniquely enabled by digital. Whereas a newspaper had to be defined up-front, such that it could be printed and distributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/&quot;&gt;at scale&lt;/a&gt;, a feed is tailored to the individual in real-time — and so are the advertisements. Suddenly it was print that was worth pennies, while the Internet generally and mobile especially were worth more than newspapers ever were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, while mediums change, humans remain the same, and here analog history is helpful; last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/never-ending-niches/&quot;&gt;I pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that while newspaper revenue grew throughout the latter half of the 20th century, circulation actually fell. It’s the same story when it comes to newspapers’ overall share of advertising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tiktok-1-1024x553.png&quot; alt=&quot;Newspapers' declining share of advertising to TV&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;346&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-5113&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tiktok-1-1024x553.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tiktok-1-300x162.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tiktok-1-768x415.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tiktok-1-1167x630.png 1167w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tiktok-1.png 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that advertising revenue is a reasonable proxy for attention, it turns out that humans like pictures more than text, and moving pictures most of all; so it has gone on the Internet. Once Facebook introduced the news feed the company quickly figured out that photos drove much more engagement; that meant that Instagram, a fledgling social network made of nothing but photos, was a tremendous threat and, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/189433922243919872&quot;&gt;once acquired&lt;/a&gt;, a tremendous opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years later, it was Instagram that Facebook used to counter Snapchat’s Stories feature, an even more immersive way of interacting with content than the feed. The point was not to win users back from Snapchat, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-audacity-of-copying-well/&quot;&gt;to prevent Instagram users from even trying Snapchat out&lt;/a&gt;; the gambit succeeded beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Rise of TikTok&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of TikTok, though, suggests that Facebook didn’t learn the correct lesson from the Snapchat threat: while part of Snapchat’s allure was the possibility of creating a new network in an app predicated on chat and disappearing media, what made Stories particularly compelling is that the experience was closer to video. That meant there was an opportunity to focus on specifically that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Facebook had spent plenty of time trying to get video to work in its feed; flush with money from its targeted feed-based advertising the company lurched from initiative to initiative predicated on encouraging professional video makers to focus on Facebook instead of YouTube. The error the company made is obvious in retrospect: what has always made Facebook powerful is that its most valuable content is generated by its own users, yet the company was counting on 3rd-parties to make compelling videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can understand Facebook’s thinking: while it is easy for users to create text updates, and, with the rise of smartphones, even easier to create pictures, producing video is difficult. Until recently, phone cameras were even worse at video than they were photos, but more importantly, compelling video takes some degree of planning and skill. The chances of your typical Facebook user having a network full of accomplished videographers is slim, and remember, when it comes to showing user-generated content, Facebook is constrained by who your friends are (the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/11/facebook-settles-ftc-charges-it-deceived-consumers-failing-keep&quot;&gt;got busted by the FTC&lt;/a&gt; for trying to switch posts from private to public).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this explains what makes TikTok such a breakthrough product. First, humans like video. Second, TikTok’s video creation tools were far more accessible and inspiring for non-professional videographers. The crucial missing piece, though, is that TikTok isn’t really a social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;ByteDance and the Algorithm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where it is important to understand the history of ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner. ByteDance’s breakthrough product was a news app called TouTiao; whereas &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2015/facebook-and-the-feed/&quot;&gt;Facebook evolved from being primarily a social network to an algorithmic feed&lt;/a&gt;, TouTiao was about the feed and the algorithm from the beginning. The first time a user opened TouTiao, the news might be rather generic, but every scroll, every linger over a story, every click, was fed into a feedback loop that refined what it was the user saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile all of that data fed back into TouTiao’s larger machine learning processes, which effectively ran billions of A/B tests a day on content of all types, cross-referenced against all of the user data it could collect. Soon the app was indispensable to its users, able to anticipate the news they cared about with nary a friend recommendation in sight. That was definitely more of a feature than a bug in China, where any information service was subject to not just overt government censorship, but also an expectation of self-censorship; all the better to control everything that end users saw, without the messiness of users explicitly recommending content themselves (although that didn’t prevent ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming from having to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-china-cracked-down-on-the-social-media-giant-bytedance&quot;&gt;a groveling apology&lt;/a&gt; for giving users too much low-brow content).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ByteDance’s 2016 launch of Douyin — the Chinese version of TikTok — revealed another, even more important benefit to relying purely on the algorithm: by expanding the library of available video from those made by your network to any video made by anyone on the service, Douyin/TikTok leverages the sheer scale of user-generated content to generate far more compelling content than professionals could ever generate, and relies on its algorithms to ensure that users are only seeing the cream of the crop. I noted while explaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/tiktok-and-quibi-tiktok-and-shopify-tiktok-complications/&quot;&gt;what Quibi got wrong&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most important fact about both movies and television is that they were defined by scarcity: there were only so many movies that would ever be made to fill only so many theater slots, and in the case of TV, there were only 24 hours in a day. That meant that there was significant value in being someone who could figure out what was going to be a hit before it was ever created, and then investing to make it so. That sort of selection and production is what Katzenberg and the rest of Hollywood have been doing for decades, and it’s understandable that Katzenberg thought he could apply the same formula to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile, though, is defined by the Internet, which is to say it is defined by abundance…So it is on TikTok, or any other app with user-generated content. The goal is not to pick out the hits, but rather to attract as much content as possible, and then algorithmically boost whatever turns out to be good…The truth is that Katzenberg got a lot right: YouTube did have a vulnerability in terms of video content on mobile, in part because it was a product built for the desktop; TikTok, like Quibi, is unequivocally a mobile application. Unlike Quibi, though, it is also an entertainment entity predicated on Internet assumptions about abundance, not Hollywood assumptions about scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Humans prefer video to photos to text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TikTok makes it easy to create videos, ensuring a massive supply of content (even if most of the supply is low quality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TikTok relies on the algorithm to surface compelling content, and is not constrained by your social network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This both explains why TikTok succeeds, and why it is an app the United States ought to be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;China’s War&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just over a year ago, after the U.S. government placed restrictions on selling components to Huawei, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/&quot;&gt;I pushed back on declarations that tech was entering a cold war&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I take the biggest issue with labeling this past week’s actions as the start of a tech cold war: China took the first shots, and they took them a long time ago. For over a decade U.S. services companies have been unilaterally shut out of the China market, even as Chinese alternatives had full reign, running on servers built with U.S. components (and likely using U.S. intellectual property).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, China’s motivation was not necessarily protectionism, at least in the economic sense: what mattered most to the country’s ruling Communist Party was control of the flow of information. At the same time, from a narrow economic perspective, the truth is that China has been limiting the economic upside of U.S. companies far longer than the U.S. has tried to limit China’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t emphasize this point enough: one of the gravest errors made by far too many people in the U.S. is taking an exceptionally self-centered view of U.S.-China relations, where everything is about what the U.S. says and does, while China is treated like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character&quot;&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, it is quite insulting to China, a great nation with a history far longer than that of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, this long history looms large in how China thinks about its relationship to the U.S. specifically, and the West generally. China is driven to reverse its “century of humiliation”, and to retake what it sees as its rightful place as a dominant force in the world. What few in the West seem to realize, though, is that the Chinese Communist Party very much believes that Marxism is the means by which that must be accomplished, and that Western liberal values are actively hostile to that goal. Tanner Greer wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/china-plans-global-order&quot;&gt;in Tablet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping endorsed this explanation for the Soviet collapse &lt;a href=&quot;https://palladiummag.com/2019/05/31/xi-jinping-in-translation-chinas-guiding-ideology/&quot;&gt;in a 2013 address to party cadres.&lt;/a&gt; “Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate?” he asked his audience. “An important reason is that in the ideological domain, competition is fierce!” The party leadership is determined to avoid the Soviet mistake. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation&quot;&gt;A leaked internal party directive from 2013&lt;/a&gt; describes “the very real threat of Western anti-China forces and their attempt at carrying out westernization” within China. The directive describes the party as being in the midst of an “intense, ideological struggle” for survival. According to the directive, the ideas that threaten China with “major disorder” include concepts such as “separation of powers,” “independent judiciaries,” “universal human rights,” “Western freedom,” “civil society,” “economic liberalism,” “total privatization,” “freedom of the press,” and “free flow of information on the internet.” To allow the Chinese people to contemplate these concepts would “dismantle [our] party’s social foundation” and jeopardize the party’s aim to build a modern, socialist future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westerners asked to think about competition with China — a minority until fairly recently, as many envisioned a China liberalized by economic integration — tend to see it through a geopolitical or military lens. But Chinese communists believe that the greatest threat to the security of their party, the stability of their country, and China’s return to its rightful place at the center of human civilization, is ideological. They are not fond of the military machines United States Pacific Command has arrayed against them, but what spooks them more than American weapons and soldiers are ideas—hostile ideas they believe America has embedded in the discourse and institutions of the existing global order. “International hostile forces [seek to] westernize and divide China” warned former CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin more than a decade ago, and that means that, as Jiang argued in a second speech, the “old international political and economic order” created by these forces “has to be changed fundamentally” to safeguard China’s rejuvenation. Xi Jinping has endorsed this view, arguing that “since the end of the Cold War countries affected by Western values have been torn apart by war or afflicted with chaos. If we tailor our practices to Western values … The consequences will be devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why it was not enough for China to have blocked Western social networks like Facebook or Twitter within China, but to also &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/&quot;&gt;demand that Western entities like the NBA police Twitter content in the United States&lt;/a&gt;; I wrote at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem from a Western perspective is that the links Clinton was so sure would push in only one direction — towards political freedom — turned out to be two-way streets: China is not simply resisting Western ideals of freedom, but seeking to impose their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding of China’s belief that it is fighting an ideological war explains why the severe curtailing of freedom that happened in Hong Kong this month was inevitable; if the Party’s ideology is ultimately opposed to liberalism anywhere, “one country-two systems” were always empty words in service of China’s rejuvenation, and Marxism’s triumph. To see that reality, though, means taking China seriously, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinocism.com/p/engineers-of-the-soul-ideology-in&quot;&gt;believing what they say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TikTok and Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that light, the latest TikTok news missed the mark, and ultimately, missed the point; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/technology/tiktok-amazon-security-risk.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon on Friday asked its employees to delete the Chinese-owned video app TikTok from their cellphones, putting the tech giant at the center of growing suspicion and paranoia about the app. Almost five hours later, Amazon reversed course, saying the email to workers was sent in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial email, which was obtained by The New York Times, Amazon officials said that because of “security risks,” employees must delete the app from any devices that “access Amazon email.” Employees had to remove the app by Friday to remain able to obtain mobile access to their Amazon email, the note said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional applications on Macs or PCs had full access to your computer — including your email — on modern smartphones apps exist in “sandboxes”, which, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ditheringfm/status/1282688510047080449&quot;&gt;as John Gruber and I discussed on Dithering&lt;/a&gt;, are much more akin to a vault or a prison; apps can only access their own data, and a limited set of external data to which they are explicitly granted permission. In other words, banning TikTok because it is surreptitiously stealing your email doesn’t make technical sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that TikTok is not capturing data: it is vacuuming up as much as it can, from your usage to your IP address to your contacts and location (if you gave the app permission). This, as many TikTok advocates note, is similar to what Facebook does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, to be clear, is absolutely true. It is also at this point where important differences emerge. First, Facebook is a U.S. company, and while TikTok claims that it is independent from ByteDance and stores data in the U.S. and Singapore, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy?lang=en#privacy-us&quot;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; is clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may share your information with a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of our corporate group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that TikTok data absolutely can be sent to China, and, it is important to note, this would be the case even if the privacy policy were not so honest. All Chinese Internet companies are compelled by the country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lawfareblog.com/beijings-new-national-intelligence-law-defense-offense&quot;&gt;National Intelligence Law&lt;/a&gt; to turn over any and all data that the government demands, and that power is not limited by China’s borders. Moreover, this requisition of data is not subject to warrants or courts, as is the case with U.S. government requests for data from Facebook or any other entity; the Chinese government absolutely could be running a learning algorithms in parallel to ByteDance’s on all TikTok data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything it would be a something of a surprise were it not; an important piece of China’s thousands of years of history is the presence of a bureaucracy focused on collecting data on, well, everyone and everything. I see examples of it here in Taiwan, where my household is registered, cameras are everywhere (and routinely accessed), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/compaq-and-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;cellphone data is a pandemic fighting tool&lt;/a&gt;, and this is a democratic country based on liberal values. China, which combines this tradition with a totalitarian government, takes data collection to the max. Facial recognition is omnipresent, nearly all transactions, even in the real world, are digital, and social networks like WeChat are completely open to censors, both from Tencent and the government; the government even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinalawblog.com/2020/07/china-malware-sorry-techno-geeks-there-still-is-no-place-to-hide.html&quot;&gt;hacks your computers&lt;/a&gt; as a matter of policy. Given this reality it is completely reasonable to be concerned about TikTok data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, though, is not the primary risk: what should truly concern Americans is the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;TikTok’s Algorithm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, after President Trump held a rally in Tulsa with a far-smaller crowd than he anticipated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html&quot;&gt;the New York Times suggested&lt;/a&gt; that TikTok might be responsible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s campaign promised huge crowds at his rally in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday, but it failed to deliver. Hundreds of teenage TikTok users and K-pop fans say they’re at least partially responsible…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok users and fans of Korean pop music groups claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets for Mr. Trump’s campaign rally as a prank. After the Trump campaign’s official account @TeamTrump posted a tweet asking supporters to register for free tickets using their phones on June 11, K-pop fan accounts began sharing the information with followers, encouraging them to register for the rally — and then not show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside whether or not the TikTok campaign or coronavirus concerns were responsible for the low turnout, I actually am inclined to believe that this movement on the video service was genuine. It is important to note, though, that there is no way we can know for sure, and, to the extent that TikTok actually did have an impact on the rally, that should frighten people of all political persuasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, this certainly wasn’t the first time that TikTok has seemed to act politically: the service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/02/tiktok-blacklivesmatter-censorship.html&quot;&gt;censored #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/28/tiktok-says-sorry-to-us-teenager-blocked-after-sharing-xinjiang-videos&quot;&gt;blocked a teenager&lt;/a&gt; discussing China’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c&quot;&gt;genocide in Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1788836/targeting-tiktoks-privacy-alone-misses-a-much-larger-point/&quot;&gt;blocked a video of Tank Man&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; published TikTok guidelines that censored Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, and the Falun Gong, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/&quot;&gt;I myself demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that TikTok appeared to be censoring the Hong Kong protests and Houston Rockets basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point, though, is not just censorship, but its inverse: propaganda. TikTok’s algorithm, unmoored from the constraints of your social network or professional content creators, is free to promote whatever videos it likes, without anyone knowing the difference. TikTok could promote a particular candidate or a particular issue in a particular geography, without anyone — except perhaps the candidate, now indebted to a Chinese company — knowing. You may be skeptical this might happen, but again, China has already demonstrated a willingness to censor speech on a platform banned in China; how much of a leap is it to think that a Party committed to ideological dominance will forever leave a route directly into the hearts and minds of millions of Americans untouched?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is where it is worth taking China seriously: the Party has shown through its actions, particularly building and maintaining the Great Firewall at tremendous expense, that it believes in the power of information and ideas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/08/the-theory-of-history-that-guides-xi-jinping/&quot;&gt;Countless speeches&lt;/a&gt;, from Chairman Xi and others, have stated that the Party believes it is in an ideological war with liberalism generally and the U.S. specifically. If we are to give China’s leaders the respect of believing what they say, instead of projecting our own beliefs for no reason other than our own solipsism, how can we take that chance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Reluctant Prescription&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a China absolutist; to give one timely example, while I mourn the end of a free and vibrant Hong Kong that I have had the pleasure of visiting on multiple occasions, I am unmoved by complaints about China’s promised adherence to the Basic Law; that was an agreement imposed on China by a colonial power, and Hong Kong is unquestionably a Chinese city, ultimately subject to Chinese law. Similarly, I abhor and condemn and encourage all &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/hong-kong-and-facebook-the-pacific-light-cable-network-system-and-stripe-facebook-lasso-and-instagram-reels/&quot;&gt;to speak out&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/16/world/asia/china-xinjiang-documents.html&quot;&gt;what is happening to Uighur’s in Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt;, but I am not counseling U.S. intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is increasingly clear, though, is that China’s insistence that the West ignore the country’s “internal affairs” is a sentiment that is not reciprocated; the list of Western companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfg1ce/list_of_companies_under_chinas_censorship_orders/&quot;&gt;bullied by China&lt;/a&gt; for Western content is long and growing, the country is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-china-built-a-twitter-propaganda-machine-then-let-it-loose-on-coronavirus&quot;&gt;flooding Twitter and Facebook&lt;/a&gt; with coronavirus propaganda, and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/wechatting-american-politics-misinformation-polarization-and-immigrant-chinese-media.php&quot;&gt;leveraging WeChat to spread misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/05/wechat-surveillance-explained/&quot;&gt;surveil the Chinese diaspora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I believe it is time to take China seriously and literally: the Communist Party is not only ideologically opposed to liberalism, it believes that only one of liberalism or Marxism can prevail. To that end it has been taking action for over 20 years to control information within its borders and, over the last several years, to control information outside of its borders. It is time for the U.S. to respond, both on the government level and corporate level, and it should do so in a multi-faceted fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, data security is absolutely a concern. To that end all companies that deal with valuable intellectual property or national security-related information should ban the use of WeChat by any of their employees, as should the government; it is simply too easy to pass information, even by accident. In addition, that same group of companies and governments &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/podcast-apps-banned-in-china-podcast-censorship-zoom-suspends-u-s-based-chinese-activist/&quot;&gt;should not use Zoom&lt;/a&gt; until the (American) company has shifted the bulk of its engineering out of China and demonstrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2020/zooms-genuine-oversight-zooms-strengths-and-weaknesses-virality-versus-network-effects/&quot;&gt;vastly improved corporate controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters more in an ideological war, though, is influence, and that is why I do believe that ByteDance’s continued ownership of TikTok is unacceptable. My strong preference would be for ByteDance to sell TikTok to non-Chinese investors or a non-Chinese company, by which I mean not-Facebook. TikTok is not only a brilliant app that figured out video on mobile, it is also shaping up to be a major challenge to Facebook’s hold on attention and thus, in the long run, advertising. This would be a very good thing, and I fear that simply banning TikTok will simply leave the market to Instagram Reels, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94FOrfF0pew&quot;&gt;Facebook’s TikTok clone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if ByteDance is unwilling to sell, then the U.S. government should be willing to act. One possible route is a review of ByteDance’s acquisition of Musical.ly by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), or invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which would require declaring a national emergency; I would prefer that Congress take the lead. What is notable is that because of the dominance of the iOS App Store and Google Play Store there is no need for an ISP-level firewall; Apple and Google can not only remove TikTok from the App Store, they could, if ordered, make already-installed apps unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, without question, a prescription I don’t come to lightly. Perhaps the most powerful argument against taking any sort of action is that we aren’t China, and isn’t blocking TikTok something that China would do? Well yes, we know that is what they would do, because the Chinese government has blocked U.S. social networks for years. Wars, though, are fought not because we lust for battle, but because we pray for peace. If China is on the offensive against liberalism not only within its borders but within ours, it is in liberalism’s interest to cut off a vector that has taken root precisely because it is so brilliantly engineered to give humans exactly what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Poland’s government will add the computer game &lt;em&gt;This War Of Mine&lt;/em&gt; to the official reading list for children in schools, the prime minister has announced during a visit to the developer of the game, Warsaw-based 11 bit studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Poland will be the first country in the world that puts its own computer game into the education ministry’s reading list,” said Mateusz Morawiecki, quoted by Polsat News. “Young people use games to imagine certain situations [in a way] no worse than reading books.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By incorporating games into the education system, we will expand our imagination and bring something new to the culture,” continued the prime minister, who noted that the game would be on the optional part of the reading list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course, games are already being used in education for teaching maths, chemistry, and developing cognitive abilities, but I don’t think we’ve ever encountered a game being officially included in the educational system on a national level as a school reading,” said Grzegorz Miechowski, CEO of 11 bit studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud to say 11 bit studios’ work can add to the development of education and culture in our country,” added Miechowski. “This can be a breakthrough moment for all artists creating games all around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This War Of Mine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was released in 2014 to widespread acclaim. Unlike most war-themed games, it focuses on the experience of civilians rather than those doing the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;et_post_video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;This War of Mine - Gameplay Trailer&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BALBUyoTxQM?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In contrast to most computer games – shooting, chasing, fast cars, more shooting – in this game there is a lot of reflection, situations in which we put ourselves [in the position] of a person who has to survive war,” said Morawiecki, noting that the game draws on the Siege of Sarajevo as well as the Warsaw Uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister admitted that it had been his children who told him about the game. “It creates space for an interesting analysis of events,” he continued. “It shows young people how to follow good paths in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prime minister noted that computer games have become part of the canon of Polish culture. The country has a thriving games industry, with The Witcher series of games – based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and developed by Polish studio CD Projekt Red – becoming a global hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their success spawned a &lt;a href=&quot;https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/02/06/nfp-podcast-the-witcher-an-interview-with-executive-producer-tomek-baginski/&quot;&gt;Netflix series&lt;/a&gt; based on Sapkowski’s books, which in turn catapulted Sapkowski to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/01/14/witcher-author-sapkowski-is-amazons-most-popular-author-after-netflix-success/&quot;&gt;top of Amazon’s bestsellers&lt;/a&gt; list. CD Projekt itself recently became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/04/04/video-game-giant-cd-projekt-becomes-polands-most-valuable-listed-firm-amid-coronavirus-turmoil/&quot;&gt;most valuable listed firm&lt;/a&gt; on the Warsaw stock exchange and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/notesfrompoland/status/1263054041203998722&quot;&gt;most valuable video games firm&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, overtaking France’s Ubisoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Games are a work of culture, natural and attractive for the young generation,” said Grzegorz Miechowski, CEO of 11 bit studios, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games speak a language instinctively understandable by them – the language of interaction. Using this language, games can talk about everything – emotions, truth, the fight between good and evil, humanity, suffering. They are similar to literature in that regard, however, they use the aforementioned language of interaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an excellent creative industry that makes Poland famous around the word,” said Morawiecki during today’s visit. “The gaming industry is growing across the whole world…[and] Poles are becoming creators of the new economic reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Games are not only a window onto the computer screen, they can be a Polish window for the world,” continued the prime minister. “Through them, we show how Poles can be creative. This is the modern face of Poland.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Huawei 5G kit must be removed from UK by 2027</title>

<description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width lead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                &lt;img class=&quot;js-image-replace&quot; alt=&quot;Huawei&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15559/production/_113358378_huawei1.png&quot; width=&quot;976&quot; height=&quot;549&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;The UK's mobile providers are being banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December, and they must also remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden told the House of Commons of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It follows sanctions imposed by Washington, which claims the firm poses a national security threat - something Huawei denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Dowden said the move would delay the country's 5G rollout by a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology promises faster internet speeds and the capacity to support more wireless devices, which should be a boon to everything from mobile gaming to higher-quality video streams, and even in time driverless cars that talk to each other. 5G connections are already available in dozens of UK cities and towns, but coverage can be sparse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Dowden added that the cumulative cost of the moves when coupled with earlier restrictions announced against Huawei would be up to £2bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has not been an easy decision, but it is the right one for the UK telecoms networks, for our national security and our economy, both now and indeed in the long run,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Watch: The digital secretary says providers must remove all of Huawei's 5G kit from their networks by 2027&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the US sanctions only affect future equipment, the government has been advised there is no security justification for removing 2G, 3G and 4G equipment supplied by Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when swapping out the company's masts, networks are likely to switch to a different vendor to provide the earlier-generation services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei said the move was &quot;bad news for anyone in the UK with a mobile phone&quot; and threatened to &quot;move Britain into the digital slow lane, push up bills and deepen the digital divide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action, however, does not affect Huawei's ability to sell its smartphones to consumers or how they will run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's ambassador to the UK said the decision was &quot;disappointing and wrong&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmbLiuXiaoMing/status/1283090285174587394?s=20&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;tweeted Liu Xiaoming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the news, saying: &quot;The UK joins a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security by prohibiting the use of untrusted, high-risk vendors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Broadband switch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New restrictions will also apply to use of the company's broadband kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operators are being told they should &quot;transition away&quot; from purchasing new Huawei equipment for use in full-fibre networks, ideally within the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Many of Huawei's products are developed at its labs near Shenzhen, China
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Dowden said the government would &quot;embark on a short technical consultation&quot; with industry leaders about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that the UK needed to avoid becoming dependent on Nokia - which is currently the only other supplier used for some equipment - and he wanted to avoid &quot;unnecessary delays&quot; to the government's gigabit-for-all by 2025 pledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BT's Openreach division told the BBC it had in fact recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.adtran.com/news-and-events/press-release-details/2020/Openreach-Partners-with-ADTRAN-to-Build-Ultrafast-Ultra-Reliable-Broadband-to-Customers-throughout-the-UK/default.aspx&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;struck a deal to buy full-fibre network kit from a new supplier&lt;/a&gt; - the US firm Adtran - but first deliveries would only start in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Chip concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK last reviewed Huawei's role in its telecoms infrastructure in January, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51283059&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;it was decided to let the firm remain a supplier but introduced a cap on its market share&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in May the US introduced new sanctions designed to disrupt Huawei's ability to get its own chips manufactured. The Trump administration claims that Huawei provides a gateway for China to spy on and potentially attack countries that use its equipment, suggestions the company strongly rejects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctions led security officials to conclude they could no longer assure the security of its products if the company had to start sourcing chips from third-parties for use in its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister cited a review carried out by GCHQ's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/huawei-advice-what-you-need-to-know&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;National Cyber Security Centre as being the motivation for the changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;TSMC&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    TSMC - one of the world's biggest chip manufacturers - has stopped taking orders from Huawei as a consequence of the US sanctions
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCSC has said Huawei products &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/a-different-future-for-telecoms-in-the-uk&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;adapted to use third-party chips would be&lt;/a&gt; &quot;likely to suffer more security and reliability problems&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other political considerations are also likely to have also come into play, including the UK's desire to strike a trade deal with the US, and growing tensions with China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its treatment of Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some backbench Tory MPs had pressed for a shorter time-span for its removal, in particular there had been calls for the 5G ban to come into effect before the next election in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Mr Dowden said that &quot;the shorter we make the timetable for removal, the greater the risk of actual disruption to mobile phone networks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BT and Vodafone had warned that customers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53349021&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;could face mobile blackouts if they were forced&lt;/a&gt; to remove all of Huawei's 5G kit in less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour's shadow technology minister Chi Onwurah said the government was incapable of sorting &quot;this mess out on their own&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had &quot;refused to face reality&quot; and been &quot;incomprehensively negligent&quot; in allowing matters to get to this point, she added, and a taskforce of experts now needed to be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopes on the part of government that this decision may put the Huawei issue to bed may be optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that we are here again despite a decision in January is because one of the key players - the US - played a new card in the form of sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there is still time between now and legislation coming to parliament in Autumn for others to do the same - whether Conservative backbenchers or Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, many countries will be watching carefully how China reacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will it feel it needs to punish the UK in order to discourage others from following its lead on 5G? Or will it want to avoid being seen as a bully and prefer to try and influence the decision more subtly? Whatever the case, the Huawei story in the UK is not over yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Chairman resigns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei says it employs about 1,600 people in the UK and claims to be one of Britain's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huawei.com/uk/facts/huawei-uk&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;largest sources of investment from China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm - whose shares are not publicly traded - does not provide a regional breakdown of its earnings. But on Monday, it announced a 13% rise in sales for the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, totalling 454bn yuan ($64.8bn; £51.3bn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK will have accounted for a fraction of that. The firm's UK chief recently noted that Huawei had only deployed a total of 20,000 5G base stations - the radio receiver/transmitter equipment fitted to a mast - in the UK so far. By contrast it expects to deliver a total of 500,000 globally this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, what the firm fears and Washington hopes is that other countries will now follow Westminster's lead with bans of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite there seeming little chance of a U-turn, Huawei said it was still urging UK ministers to reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will conduct a detailed review of what today's announcement means for our business here and will work with the UK government to explain how we can continue to contribute to a better connected Britain,&quot; spokesman Ed Brewster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the announcement &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sky.com/story/lord-browne-quits-as-huawei-uk-chairman-as-government-ban-looms-12028206&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Sky News revealed that Lord Browne&lt;/a&gt;, Huawei's UK chairman and the ex-chief executive of BP, would be leaving the Chinese company before his term had expired. It said he had given his notice a few days ago and would formally step down in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Lord Browne is stepping down six months before his time at Huawei was due to end
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Browne had led efforts to improve the company's image in the UK and had tried to prevent a ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has been central to our commitment here dating back 20 years, and we thank him for his valuable contribution,&quot; said Huawei, confirming the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Industry reaction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BT is set to be the telecoms operator most affected by the decision given it runs both the EE mobile network and Openreach, which provides fixed-line infrastructure to individual internet providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to further analyse the details and implications of this decision before taking a view of potential costs and impacts,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move should, however, benefit Nokia and Ericsson, which are the two other main 5G kit vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed... with minimal impact on the people using our customers' networks,&quot; said Nokia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson added: &quot;Today's decision removes the uncertainty that was slowing down investment decisions around the deployment of 5G in the UK... and we stand ready to work with the UK operators to meet their timetable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, both firms manufacture some of their 5G equipment in China, which has also caused concern in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the US Department of Defense published a list of 20 companies it claimed had close ties to the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It included Panda Electronics - the firm with which Ericsson jointly runs a manufacturing facility in the Chinese city of Nanjing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of companies assemble equipment or have some type of manufacturing in China,&quot; Ericsson's head of corporate communications Peter Olofsson told the BBC, when asked about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our trade compliance people have looked at this [list] and they concluded that it's not something that has an impact on Ericsson or our operations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Huawei believes that this was a political decision and not a business one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if the political winds change, then Huawei's fortunes may too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that a longer time frame for the removal of its 5G kit from UK networks was a relatively desirable outcome for Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even though no new Huawei UK equipment can be bought by UK mobile carriers after the end of this year, the fact that the UK has until 2027 to remove Huawei's 5G kit from all of its network could be seen as a potential positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new US administration in November could markedly change Washington's position on Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for Huawei, playing the long game makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one thing that was crystal clear to me from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47274679&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;meeting Ren Zhengfei, the company's founder is that he's a fighter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Ren Zhengfei told the BBC: 'If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North is dark, then there is still the South.'
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing he has said indicates he is willing to give up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now though, the immediate impact of the UK decision will be seen as a signal that Washington's campaign on Huawei has worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Chinese firm will not want that replicated in other countries around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
