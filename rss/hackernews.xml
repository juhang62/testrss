<description>&lt;p&gt;That has been a problem for other gaming services in the past. Examples include Valve's Steam Link app, which displays a copy of the person's personal computer on a phone or tablet somewhere else in their home, or the Shadow gaming app, which gives users an entire remote computer to use.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Marketers are addicted to bad data</title>
<link>https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/marketers-addicted-bad-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/marketers-addicted-bad-data</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern marketing is all about data and however hard you might try, you can't spend any time around marketers online without &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.marketo.com/2013/11/prove-your-worth10-kpis-for-marketers.html&quot;&gt;being&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/paid-owned-earned-content/242075/&quot;&gt;subjected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/oracledatacloud/effectively-measuring-advertising-performance-your-guide-to-success&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/using-auction-insights-for-better-ppc-competitor-analysis-343264&quot;&gt;endless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/07/28/10-reasons-why-marketers-use-data-to-make-budgeting-decisions/&quot;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/spent-200000-facebook-ads-heres-learned&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt;, how-to guides, ebooks or other dreck about how we need to track and measure and count every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got click rates, impressions, conversion rates, open rates, ROAS, pageviews, bounces rates, ROI, CPM, CPC, impression share, average position, sessions, channels, landing pages, KPI after never ending KPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That'd be fine if all this shit meant something and we knew how to interpret it. But &lt;em&gt;it doesn't&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;we don't&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is much simpler, and therefore much more complex. Most of us don't understand how data is collected, how these mechanisms work and most importantly where and how they &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if we know how the data is collected, what it means and what it's actually tracking, most of us don't have the technical chops to analyse the data we've collected&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;. I don't mean to rag on anyone by saying this, but we do need a reality check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And look. I get it. Having tangible data allows us to demonstrate that we're doing our job and we're trying to measure and improve what we're doing. But as Bob Hoffman rightly points out - &lt;a href=&quot;http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-mystery-of-modern-media.html&quot;&gt;that's not how brands are built&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers are often all we have to prove our case, to get more budget and in extreme cases, to continue to stay employed. We'll remain in this mess until we can separate marketing from short sighted and poorly informed decision making. Until leaders can lead on the strength of their conviction and experience instead of second guessing themselves and their staff based on the inadequacy of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what the way out of this mess is, or what the path to success looks like. All I know is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We're addicted to bad data&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Biden wins White House, vowing new direction for divided U.S.</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States on Saturday, positioning himself to lead a nation gripped by a historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;His victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed processing. Biden crossed the winning threshold of 270 Electoral College votes with a win in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump refused to concede, threatening further legal action on ballot counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden, 77, staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a broad coalition of voters around the notion that Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy. The strategy proved effective, resulting in pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Pennsylvania, onetime Democratic bastions that had flipped to Trump in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Component-dfp-0-2-78&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden’s victory was a repudiation of Trump’s divisive leadership and the president-elect now inherits a deeply polarized nation grappling with foundational questions of racial justice and economic fairness while in the grips of a virus that has killed more than 236,000 Americans and reshaped the norms of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden, in a statement, declared it was time for the battered nation “to unite and to heal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;“With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,” he said. “There’s nothing we can’t do if we do it together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Nonetheless, Trump was not giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Departing from longstanding democratic tradition and signaling a potentially turbulent transfer of power, he issued a combative statement saying his campaign would take unspecified legal actions. And he followed up with a bombastic, all-caps tweet in which he falsely declared, “I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES.” Twitter immediately flagged it as misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump has pointed to delays in processing the vote in some states to allege with no evidence that there was fraud and to argue that his rival was trying to seize power — an extraordinary charge by a sitting president trying to sow doubt about a bedrock democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Kamala Harris made history as the first Black woman to become vice president, an achievement that comes as the U.S. faces a reckoning on racial justice. The California senator, who is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency, will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government, four years after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump is the first incumbent president to lose reelection since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;He was golfing at his Virginia country club when he lost the race. He stayed out for hours, stopping to congratulate a bride as he left, and his motorcade returned to the White House to a cacophony of shouts, taunts and unfriendly hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;In Wilmington, Delaware, near a stage that has stood empty since it was erected to celebrate on Election Night, people cheered and pumped their fists as the news that the presidential race had been called for the state’s former senator arrived on their cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;On the nearby water, two men in a kayak yelled to a couple paddling by in the opposite direction, “Joe won! They called it!” as people on the shore whooped and hollered. Harris, in workout gear, was shown on video speaking to Biden on the phone, exuberantly telling the president-elect “We did it!” Biden was expected to take the stage for a drive-in rally after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Across the country, there were parties and prayer. In New York City, spontaneous block parties broke out. People ran out of their buildings, banging on pots. They danced and high-fived with strangers amid honking horns. Among the loudest cheers were those for passing U.S. Postal Service trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;People streamed into Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, near where Trump had ordered the clearing of protesters in June, waving signs and taking cellphone pictures. In Lansing, Michigan, Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter demonstrators filled the Capitol steps. The lyrics to “Amazing Grace” began to echo through the crowd, and Trump supporters laid their hands on a counter protester, and prayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Americans showed deep interest in the presidential race. A record 103 million voted early this year, opting to avoid waiting in long lines at polling locations during a pandemic. With counting continuing in some states, Biden had already received more than 74 million votes, more than any presidential candidate before him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Component-dfp-0-2-78&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump’s refusal to concede has no legal implications. But it could add to the incoming administration’s challenge of bringing the country together after a bitter election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, arguing without evidence that the election could be marred by fraud. The nation has a long history of presidential candidates peacefully accepting the outcome of elections, dating back to 1800, when John Adams conceded to his rival Thomas Jefferson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;It was Biden’s native Pennsylvania that put him over the top, the state he invoked throughout the campaign to connect with working class voters. He also won Nevada on Saturday pushing his total to 290 Electoral College votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden received congratulations from dozens of world leaders, and his former boss, President Barack Obama, saluted him in a statement, declaring the nation was “fortunate that Joe’s got what it takes to be President and already carries himself that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Republicans on Capitol Hill were giving Trump and his campaign space to consider all their legal options. It was a precarious balance for Trump’s allies as they try to be supportive of the president -- and avoid risking further fallout -- but face the reality of the vote count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had not yet made any public statements -- either congratulating Biden or joining Trump’s complaints. But retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is close to McConnell, said, “After counting every valid vote and allowing courts to resolve disputes, it is important to respect and promptly accept the result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;More than 236,000 Americans have died during the coronavirus pandemic, nearly 10 million have been infected and millions of jobs have been lost. The final days of the campaign played out against a surge in confirmed cases in nearly every state, including battlegrounds such as Wisconsin that swung to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The pandemic will soon be Biden’s to tame, and he campaigned pledging a big government response, akin to what Franklin D. Roosevelt oversaw with the New Deal during the Depression of the 1930s. But Senate Republicans fought back several Democratic challengers and looked to retain a fragile majority that could serve as a check on such Biden ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;relatedStory-0-2-84 Component-block-0-2-79&quot; readability=&quot;0.7887323943662&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election 2020: More coverage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The 2020 campaign was a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which has shuttered schools across the nation, disrupted businesses and raised questions about the feasibility of family gatherings heading into the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The fast spread of the coronavirus transformed political rallies from standard campaign fare to gatherings that were potential public health emergencies. It also contributed to an unprecedented shift to voting early and by mail and prompted Biden to dramatically scale back his travel and events to comply with restrictions. The president defied calls for caution and ultimately contracted the disease himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump was saddled throughout the year by negative assessments from the public of his handling of the pandemic. There was another COVID-19 outbreak in the White House this week, which sickened his chief of staff Mark Meadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden also drew a sharp contrast to Trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of Black Americans including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Their deaths sparked the largest racial protest movement since the civil rights era. Biden responded by acknowledging the racism that pervades American life, while Trump emphasized his support of police and pivoted to a “law and order” message that resonated with his largely white base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;The third president to be impeached, though acquitted in the Senate, Trump will leave office having left an indelible imprint in a tenure defined by the shattering of White House norms and a day-to-day whirlwind of turnover, partisan divide and Twitter blasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump’s team has filed a smattering of lawsuits in battleground states, some of which were immediately rebuffed by judges. His personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was holding a news conference in Philadelphia threatening more legal action when the race was called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden, born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and raised in Delaware, was one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the Senate. Before he took office, his wife and daughter were killed, and his two sons badly injured in a 1972 car crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Commuting every night on a train from Washington back to Wilmington, Biden fashioned an everyman political persona to go along with powerful Senate positions, including chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. Some aspects of his record drew critical scrutiny from fellow Democrats, including his support for the 1994 crime bill, his vote for the 2003 Iraq War and his management of the Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign was done in by plagiarism allegations, and his next bid in 2008 ended quietly. But later that year, he was tapped to be Barack Obama’s running mate and he became an influential vice president, steering the administration’s outreach to both Capitol Hill and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;While his reputation was burnished by his time in office and his deep friendship with Obama, Biden stood aside for Clinton and opted not to run in 2016 after his adult son Beau died of brain cancer the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74&quot;&gt;Trump’s tenure pushed Biden to make one more run as he declared that “the very soul of the nation is at stake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;As election night ended in the United States, people went to bed still wondering who had won the presidential race, which party would control Congress, and what the future held. But one subject unified the electorate with unexpectedly decisive consistency: drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to relax laws around the use of psychoactive substances, voters said yes, whether they were in the reddest red states or the bluest blue. New Jersey, Arizona, and Montana all voted to legalize recreational cannabis. Mississippi voted to legalize medical marijuana, and South Dakota legalized both recreational and medicinal uses of weed. “Whenever drug reforms were on the ballot, they won quite handily,” says Leo Beletsky, an epidemiologist and the faculty director of Northeastern University’s Health in Justice Lab. “That shows a hunger for major shifts and reforms across party lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People want a truce in the War on Drugs. Cannabis has been rebranded as a wellness panacea. Mushrooms and MDMA are making headlines as therapy tools, not party fuel. And as the overdose crisis continues, it is ever more apparent to a growing swath of the country that threatening to jail drug users doesn’t reduce drug-related death rates or help families struggling to save their loved ones. Instead, it disproportionately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614457/&quot;&gt;hurts&lt;/a&gt; Black communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png&quot; width=&quot;218&quot; height=&quot;58&quot;/&gt;What once sounded like progressive pipe dreams—&lt;em&gt;decriminalize it, legalize it!&lt;/em&gt;—is now increasingly interpreted as simple common sense, and not just when it comes to cannabis. “There's a disconnect between what the voters want and what the legislators are comfortable with,” Beletsky says. In other words: voters are far more progressive on this particular issue than their congressional representatives. (Even cannabis remains federally illegal.) On Tuesday, Washington, DC, voted to decriminalize psilocybin, and Oregon’s voters approved two landmark reform measures—Measure 109, which legalizes psilocybin therapies, and Measure 110, which decriminalizes personal possession of drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Historic”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What passed in Oregon was historic,” says Beau Kilmer, director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. “A lot of other states are going to pay attention to how this plays out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the passage of Measure 110, people found with illegal drugs in Oregon will be asked to complete a health assessment with a certified drug and alcohol counselor, or to pay a $100 fine—but they will not face criminal charges. The measure draws funding for its increased treatment options from state cannabis tax revenue, as well as projected savings from reduced arrests and incarceration. In essence, it reimagines the entire state’s response to drug issues, making it a public health matter, not a criminal justice one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad_wrapper&quot; aria-label=&quot;In Content advertisement&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ad_notice&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug policy reform advocates are heartened by Oregon’s substantial shift away from punishment. “This puts resources and funding into things that work—evidence-based treatment, as well as housing and harm reduction,” says Kassandra Frederique, the executive director of the drug reform nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance, which led contributions to the “Yes to 110” campaign. “We have always advocated for replacing criminalization with a health-centered approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ground in Oregon, some people who work in addiction treatment are also elated. “This is a huge public health win,” says Andrew Seaman, a Portland, Oregon-based addiction medicine researcher. Seaman sees decriminalization as a change that could help on several fronts of the ongoing overdose crisis. Studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836121/&quot;&gt;indicate&lt;/a&gt; that opioid users who are incarcerated are far more likely to fatally overdose shortly after being released than the general population. Not putting drug users in jail for possession, Seaman says, will reduce their likelihood of going through withdrawal and then overdosing when they get out. He also believes that decriminalization will reduce stigma surrounding drug use, encouraging people to more openly and proactively seek treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Look at Portugal”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reduction of stigma is especially important in normalizing medication-assisted treatments (MAT) like buprenorphine. A growing body of evidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/05/15/medication-assisted-treatment-what-we-know/&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that MAT are more effective than abstinence-only approaches to drug use disorders, but they are still sometimes dismissed as a crutch, a swapping of one vice for another. (In 2017, more than 700 researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/16/528614422/prices-remarks-on-opioid-treatment-were-unscientific-and-damaging-experts-say&quot;&gt;signed an open letter&lt;/a&gt; to former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price after Price criticized MAT in this way.) And while the decriminalization of all drugs may sound like an extreme step to Americans raised on DARE classes and “Just Say No” commercials, there’s ample evidence that it’s a part of an approach to drugs that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look at Portugal,” Frederique says. Portugal, which decriminalized drugs 20 years ago, has reduced its HIV infection rates and drug-related deaths dramatically. Its humane, science-based approach to treatment is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/upshot/portugal-drug-legalization-treatment.html&quot;&gt;often cited&lt;/a&gt; as proof that softening drug laws can reduce drug problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Oregon measure passed with more than 58 percent of the vote, it had fierce critics as well as fervent supporters. Washington County District Attorney Kevin Barton called it a “terrible idea” earlier this year and suggested it would lead to increased drug use and crime. Meanwhile, other organizations opposed it for not going far enough, like the Oregon Council for Behavioral Health, which supports decriminalization of drug charges but objected to its plans for funding. Kilmer is eager to study how Oregon’s new policies play out but believes it’s too soon to tell whether it will be a success in its execution. “It’s hard to predict what the overall effect will be,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“A step in the right direction”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experts have stressed that removing criminal punishment is not the be-all, end-all for drug reform. “Decriminalization, I think, is a step in the right direction, but it has to go along with other public health strategies,” Brendan Saloner, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says. “What’s often missed in the conversation about Portugal is that Portugal has a relatively good service model for helping people. A lot of those services are sort of spotty in our country.” Its model worked because it offered comprehensive substance-use disorder treatment in addition to decriminalization. Even though most headlines about it will highlight its decriminalization aspect, the success or failure of Oregon’s new drug policy may hinge on whether it creates new routes to receive high-quality treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are many unknowns, though, they’re necessary unknowns. It is clear that the prohibition and criminalization of drugs has not made the country safer or healthier. Oregon’s experiment is rooted in evidence and empathy, and it could serve as a useful blueprint for other states—or even the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would be much better if we had a coordinated national strategy rather than trying to do this piecemeal,” Saloner says. In a nation still starkly divided, perhaps politicians will start noticing how popular this reform movement is and catch up to their constituents.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why not use GraphQL?</title>
<link>https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to &quot;Why use GraphQL&quot; by Kyle Schrade (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/&lt;/a&gt;). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't read Kyles's article already, I think it makes most sense if you read it first: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author states that REST APIs come with a set of downsides and how GraphQL solves all of them: Over-fetching Multiple requests for multiple resources Waterfall network requests on nested data Each client need to know the location of each service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three issues could be solved by writing another REST API as a facade for a specific user interface. Take Next.JS as an example. Next lets you define APIs with a very lightweight syntax. Instead of making multiple requests from the client, you can wrap those calls into an API and make them server-side. Over and underfetching can be solved with this approach too, as you can manipulate the data before sending it back to the client. The pattern described is named &quot;backend for frontend&quot; (BFF). It's not limited to full stack frameworks like Next.JS. You can build a BFF for your mobile apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the BFF pattern, the client itself doesn't have to know the location of each service. However, the developer who implements the BFF needs to understand the service landscape. Hopefully you have Open API Specifications for all your services, nicely presented in a developer portal. If that's the case, it should be easy to write a BFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With GraphQL, there still needs to be a developer who implements the resolvers. Implementing the resolvers is more or less the same task as building a BFF, the logic is very similar. So, what's the real difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BFF is easier to implement as there's a lot more tooling available. E.g. if you use a framework like Next.JS in combination with swr hooks (stale while revalidate) you get automatic caching with Etags and cache invalidation out of the box. This reduces the amount of data sent between server and client. It's even less data than GraphQL, because you're not sending query payloads and the server responds with 304 (Not Modified) if the response is still valid. Additionally, you don't have to use a heavyweight client like Apollo. The library swr by Vercel is small and very easy to use. It comes with support for pagination, hooks, and helps to navigate back and forth very efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL has persisted queries but it comes with additional overhead to implement this. If you don't use a client like Relay, which persists Queries by default, you have to do it on your own or use some third party library to implement it. Compared to the BFF approach using e.g. Next.JS there's a lot more complexity involved in getting to the same results on the frontend. How would you implement Etags with GraphQL? How do you make your GraphQL server return 304 status codes if nothing changed? Don't you first have to turn all Queries into GET requests? If so, does your GraphQL client and server easily support this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to user experience and ease of development, the BFF is the clear winner. Less data transfer between client and server. Easier to implement. Smaller client, less moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a catch. You have to build a BFF for each individual frontend. If you have many of them this can be a lot of work. You have to maintain all the BFFs. You have to operate them. You have to secure them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be nice if you could have the benefits of both without making tradeoffs? This is exactly what WunderGraph is. A framework to build BFFs using GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next paragraph, Kyle goes on with the problems involved with versioned APIs. He's absolutely right that having too many versions of an API makes it very hard to keep track of. He then concludes that in GraphQL, there's only one version of the graph and changes can be tracked in a schema registry, a paid feature of Apollo. For that reason you won’t have any problems with versioning, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have problems coming to the same conclusion. Just because GraphQL schemas don’t support versioning natively doesn’t mean the problem goes away. You get the same effect if you just don’t version your REST APIs. In fact, many experts say that you should always try to not introduce versions of an API if you don’t have to. That being said, what holds you off running two versions of your GraphQL schema? Not that I think this is a good idea but it's technically possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If having too many versions of your REST APIs is a problem in your organization, before throwing a new tool like GraphQL at the problem, maybe you should have a look at the organization first. What are the reasons for having so many versions? Maybe the change of a process or new team structures can help? GraphQL does absolutely nothing to solve your versioning problems. Instead I think it actually makes the situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have to support mobile applications? You should be aware that shipping native apps takes time. You have to wait for app store approval and you can expect many of your users to never (or slowly) install the new version. What if you want to introduce a breaking change in this scenario without breaking a client? It's impossible. You have to introduce this change in a non-breaking way. It would be interesting to hear from Facebook how they avoided breaking clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolving your schema in the case of GraphQL would mean, you deprecate the old field and add a new one. New clients use the new field while you hope that the number of clients using the old field will get less and less. Hopefully, you have a system in place that forces your users to download a new version at some point in time. Otherwise, you might be forced to support the deprecated field indefinitely. If that's the case, the deprecation model of GraphQL doesn't help you at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With REST you could create a new endpoint or another version of an existing one. The problem is the same, the solution just looks a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it clear, if you cannot control your clients you really want some kind of versioning. If all you have is a single web application you won’t need this feature. But then again GraphQL might be overkill as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph, the author states that RESTful APIs don't allow partial responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just wrong. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mdxCodeBlock_1XEh&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeBlockContent_1u-d&quot;&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; aria-label=&quot;Copy code to clipboard&quot; class=&quot;copyButton_10dd&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;div tabindex=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_3iAC&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeBlockLines_b7E3&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;GET /users?fields=results(gender,name)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the author actually mean? I'm pretty sure he's aware of partial responses. I guess what he's trying to say is that someone needs to implement partial responses. Actually, it looks very familiar to GraphQL as you're selecting subfields from a resource. With GraphQL we have this feature out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with the BFF approach, you don't need this. Just return exactly the data you need. Again, a full-stack framework like Next.JS makes it simpler to implement this, makes caching easier and gives you Etag based cache invalidation for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum this section up, GraphQL gives you exactly the data you need. Partial responses can achieve the same result. BFFs come with the additional cost of implementation and maintenance but have a better UX &amp;amp; DX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph, Kyle addresses the issues of REST APIs not being strictly typed. He talks about the problems with APIs where it's not clear if you get an array of posts or something different and how query parameters complicate the situation. He also states that GraphQL, because of its strict type system, doesn't have this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what Kyle is talking about is an organizational problem for which you need an organizational solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the kind of problems he describes, when you allow developers to deploy REST APIs without publishing Open API Specifications (OAS) or similar. With OAS all resources can be described very easily. OAS also allows you to describe OAuth2 flows and required scopes per endpoint. Additionally, you can describe the exact types and validation rules for query parameters, a feature that GraphQL is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at GraphQL, there's no way to describe Authentication, Authorization and input validation. GraphQL is lacking these features because the inventors at Facebook solved this problem at a different layer. There was no need for them to add these features to GraphQL. You can add custom directives to your schema to achieve similar results like OAS but this would be a custom implementation which you have to maintain yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking that OAS doesn't guarantee the response of an API to be compliant with the specification. You would be right. But how does a GraphQL schema guarantee anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL introspection is the act of sending a specific GraphQL query to the server to get information about the GraphQL schema. The GraphQL server is free to answer with whatever types it wants to. If you send a Query, the server can answer with a response that doesn't adhere to the GraphQL schema from the introspection response. Take Apollo Federation as an example. You upload your schema into a schema registry and then, by error, deploy the wrong version of your GraphQL server. If you change the type of a field, the client might be confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about type safety in GraphQL, what we actually mean is that we trust in a GraphQL server to behave exactly as advertised by the introspection Query response. Why can't we trust an Open API Specification in the same way? I think we can. If we don't, we have a people problem, not a technical one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next paragraph, a short one, is about how GraphQL improves client performance and reduces network round trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've explained more than enough how much more powerful a BFF is and how much you gain from the ‘stale while revalidate pattern’ compared to a heavyweight GraphQL client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, GraphQL does indeed reduce the number of requests and reduces the overall data transfer. However, you should always consider the cost of adding a GraphQL client to your frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section is about how tools like OAS are being used for RESTful API development and the challenges of maintaining multiple OAS in microservice environments. Kyle compares a single GraphQL schema with Swagger files spread out across multiple git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's clear that navigating a single GraphQL schema is a lot simpler than looking at multiple OAS files, sitting in git repositories. However, to be fair, we have to compare apples to apples. If you want to make your developers productive, you wouldn't stick OAS files into a git repository and call it a day. You would run a developer portal where you can search for APIs and navigate between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAS relies on JSON-Schema which comes with an amazing feature: You can reference object types from another document. You can divide your OAS into multiple files which reference each other if required. There's also tooling to combine multiple OAS files into a single OAS document. You could then use this document and feed it into a developer portal which lets you explore all APIs as a whole. Keep in mind that there's the additional cost of setting up all this. You need to run a dev portal or buy one. You have to describe all your APIs, which, at least at the beginning, can be a burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to add, there are a lot of frameworks that let you describe a schema in your favourite programming language, e.g. through defining Objects or Classes. You'll then get an auto-generated Open API specification served at a well-known endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's compare that to GraphQL. There are basically two approaches, SDL first vs. code first. Whatever way you go, you end up with a GraphQL schema which describes all your types as well as fields and allows you to comment on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's the difference then? OAS comes with more overhead to set things up. On the other hand, OAS has built-in support documenting example use cases, authentication &amp;amp; authorization as well as input validation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that GraphiQL itself has no concept of multiple GraphQL schemas. If you have multiple GraphQL (micro-)services you have to run or buy a dedicated component, e.g. a schema registry which is similar to a developer portal for REST APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wanted to dedicate an extra paragraph is API use cases. Just because you have an OAS or a GraphQL schema doesn't mean your API is well documented. What can an API user do with the API? How can they use it? What are good use cases? What are the bad ones? Where to ask for help? How do I authenticate a user? Do I need an API key? Documenting your API in a way that helps API consumers use it is much more work than adding descriptions to types and fields. OAS allows you to add example payloads and describe them. GraphQL is lacking this feature. Look at Stripe for a positive example of this. They went way beyond what a Swagger or GraphQL Playground could ever achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, you look at the public GraphQL API of GitHub you will find not a single example Query. Let's say you want to get information about a repository and all its issues. You'd have to open GraphiQL and start searching. However, the search functionality in GraphiQL doesn't really help you much. Someone needs to sit down and write example Queries and use cases on how to use the API. Otherwise, it's really hard to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while the community keeps saying &quot;GraphQL is self-documenting&quot; this feature alone doesn't make a useful API. OAS gives you a tool to add use cases but you still have to write them. It takes effort to make an API useful to others, no matter what tools or languages you chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph, the author says that keeping around old versions of REST APIs for mobile apps is a pain. He concludes that because we're only using a single GraphQL server, we don't have this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry, but again, I get to a completely different conclusion. If you set the rule to disallow versioning, you can add new endpoints or swap the implementation of existing ones. There is no difference between GraphQL and REST in this case. Supporting legacy apps is a challenge with both REST and GraphQL APIs. You need to find a way to not break the contract between client and server. It doesn't matter if your server exposes REST or GraphQL, the problem is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On error handling, the author describes a scenario where a client would have to make 3 subsequent REST API calls compared to a single GraphQL query that would respond with partial data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With GraphQL, the logic of resolving partial data sits in the server. The client needs to have additional logic to react to a partial response appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With REST the logic of fetching partial data could sit in the client or in a BFF. Either way, the logic is more or less the same as with GraphQL, it just sits somewhere else. Obviously, the REST API use case also needs logic in the client to handle a partial response. This logic will be almost identical to the one in the GraphQL use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing holds you off from returning specific information in a REST response on why something failed. OAS allows union types so you're free to give rich information to the client about a partial response. This is similar to the concept of response unions described by Sascha Solomon (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sachee.medium.com/200-ok-error-handling-in-graphql-7ec869aec9bc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://sachee.medium.com/200-ok-error-handling-in-graphql-7ec869aec9bc&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does GraphQL really have better error handling? I think both OAS and GraphQL give you good tooling to handle errors in a very user-friendly way. It's up to the developer to make good use of these tools. There's no free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyle concludes the whole article by saying that GraphQL is the future of APIs because it's superior in terms of performance, payload size, developer time and built-in documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that GraphQL is the future of APIs, but for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better performance and smaller payload size are no unique features to GraphQL. You can achieve better results with other tools or have to extend GraphQL, e.g. using Relay to get persisted Queries. To get real benefits from GraphQL documentation you definitely have to do more than just adding descriptions to your schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the dust is settled and the hype is gone, we have to look at the facts. We should not try and convince the world that GraphQL is something which it isn't. There are a lot of advantages of using GraphQL but depending on your use case you might not really benefit from them. Instead of advertising GraphQL as the holy grail, we should give a more nuanced response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to tackle this is to look at the problem first and then make a distinctive comparison of possible tools to solve a problem. If your organization fails at implementing REST APIs, how does GraphQL solve this problem? Maybe something within your organization has to change? If, on the other hand, it's not an organizational problem, and you're absolutely sure REST is no good alternative for your use case, I bet you will love the developer experience of GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GraphQL in itself is barely useful. It’s the tools that make GraphQL so powerful. It’s the community, it’s us! It’s companies like Apollo, Hasura, The Guild, FaunaDB, Dgraph, GraphCMS and I hope WunderGraph too, who make GraphQL so powerful. It’s GraphiQL, various GraphQL clients, Schema Stitching, Federation. This whole ecosystem of tools is the reason why GraphQL is the next big thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More tools and services will strengthen the ecosystem. A stronger ecosystem will lead to more adoption which again will lure in more companies to add services and tools to the GraphQL ecosystem, a very positive loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL in that regard is very similar to Kubernetes. Docker, the container runtime, wasn’t enough. Wrapping complex Syscalls into a simple to use API was the enabler but in order to create a rich ecosystem a scheduler was needed that was expressive enough and allowed very easy extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL gives us a language to define and consume APIs with the same simplicity as Docker. If you have seen a few lines of Javascript and JSON before, GraphQL immediately feels familiar. But similar to Docker, the language itself is not that powerful. It’s the extensibility and the tools around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language open-sourced by Facebook is not what made it successful. It’s tools like Relay that did. Unfortunately, many of the tools used internally never made it to the public. The community had to catch up with this which I think we’ve got pretty far already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Kyle asks “Why GraphQL” I think what he actually means is “Why Apollo”. And the answer is simple. No one cared to build a rich ecosystem around REST APIs. Try to generate a React.JS client from an Open API Specification. The experience sucks, compared to what GraphQL clients give you. No one figured out a good business model to solve the problem. Enter GraphQL and you get a massive amount of tools to abstract away problems you don’t want to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REST APIs will become less relevant for the described use cases not because GraphQL is superior. It’s the tools and ecosystem that will make GraphQL continue to gain market share. The pace at which the GraphQL ecosystem is expanding is massive compared to REST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermedia APIs played and still play a big role for server rendered web applications. However, the web is moving forward. Users expect an experience as native as it could be from websites. The Jamstack is taking over on the frontend. Hybrid models with server side rendering and dynamic Javascript clients are the enablers of these applications. RESTful APIs excel at a different set of problems. They will not go away, quite the opposite! They’re just not the right tool for this style of applications the industry is currently shifting towards. I think REST APIs are a perfect tool for internal APIs, partner APIs and server to server communication. This is an area where GraphQL doesn’t really bring any benefits over REST. Alongside RPC it will have a great future in this area. GraphQL on the other hand is more than happy to wrap resource- and RPC-based APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think GraphQL would have become what it is without all the tooling by Apollo? What about the conferences? GraphQL Summit? Hasura online conferences? GraphQL in Space by Dgraph? What about the massive open source contributions by The Guild? GraphQL Galaxy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this gave you a more nuanced view of why you should use GraphQL. A less hype-loaded view which should prepare you well to convince your manager.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Why not use GraphQL? | wundergraph</og:title>
<og:description>I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to &quot;Why use GraphQL&quot; by Kyle Schrade (https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.</og:description>

<title>Raspberry Pi 400 – First Impressions</title>
<link>https://martinpeck.com/blog/2020/11/06/Raspberry-Pi-400/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://martinpeck.com/blog/2020/11/06/Raspberry-Pi-400/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up programming on my TV, with a Sinclair ZX81 followed by a ZX Spectum. Computers built into keyboards, that you can easily plug into a TV, are part of my DNA. So, given this, how could I resist buying the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi 400&lt;/a&gt;!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are my initial thoughts on the hardware, and on using it for light weight development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I like it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tech-specs&quot;&gt;Tech Specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 400 is, essentially, a Raspberry Pi 4 housed within a keyboard. You can read much better descriptions elseewhere, but the main points from the tech specs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4GB LPDDR4-3200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth 5.0, BLE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gigabit Ethernet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 × USB 3.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 × USB 2.0 ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontal 40-pin GPIO header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 × micro HDMI ports (supports up to 4Kp60)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MicroSD card slot for operating system and data storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;79-key compact keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(full specs can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/specifications/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 400 comes with a 16GB SD card pre-installed with Raspbian, and a host of apps (LibreOffice), dev tools (Geany, Mathematica, Scratch), utilities (Chromium, VLC Media Player), and games (Minecraft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-impressions-on-the-hardware&quot;&gt;First Impressions on the Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to plug the 400 in and get it up and running. It’s a neat device, with a good collection of ports and connectors at the back. The keyboard is…ok. The device is £67 in the UK. I bought the kit (which includes a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and official guide) for £94. Given the price point the keyboard is absolutely fine, but it does feel a tiny bit “plasticy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 400 doesn’t have an audio-out. Audio is delivered via the HDMI output. For me, that’s a problem because my monitor doesn’t have speakers. It’s not a BIG problem, but it’s something I hadn’t considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing the 400 doesn’t have is the connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module. Again, this isn’t a big deal for me but if you were expecting to build any camera projects then the 400 isn’t the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 400has the GPIO header at the back, so with a ribbon cable you can build electronics projects very easily. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/2028&quot;&gt;Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus&lt;/a&gt; which makes it very easy to connect the 400 to a breadboard and build…stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/gpio.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GPIO&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 400 starts up quickly, and is very capable as a general purpose desktop device. I’ve spent most of today browsing the web on it, while also installing apps, running docker containers, and building code, and it’s felt fast/snappy pretty much most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the hardware is pretty good and I love the form factor. I can see schools/code clubs purchasing these devices and using the in their computing labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;developer-experience&quot;&gt;Developer Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the day setting my Raspberry Pi 400 up, and I’m pretty impressed. My setup has included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, this setup was easy. So easy it was almost boring! I had a couple of issues, but on the whole it was very easy to set my Raspberry Pi 400 up so that I can write code, use Docker, and push changes to GitHub. For example, I’m currently writing this blog post within VS Code, building it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; within a Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only issue that I hit is the ARM support for various Docker images. The default Ruby dev container image wouldn’t build because it had some dependencies that didn’t have ARM variants. In the end I took the Ruby 2.7 docker image as a base, and copy/pasted into my own &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; the parts of the defintion I needed (removing Node, Zsh, Oh my Zsh and a few other things). I’m not sure exactly what it was that was failng to build, so I need to go back and work it out, but it’s worth remembering that if the Rasberry Pi is ARM based, and not all development tools have ARM builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having installed tools, and played around, I’ve built some very basic Rust code (with build times comparible to my MacBook!), I’ve written some &lt;a href=&quot;https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot;&gt;GPIOZero&lt;/a&gt; based Python 3 code (controlling butons and LEDs), and I’ve set up a Jekyll/Ruby dev container and built/updated my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3). Most of them are the Model B format, but I have couple of Zeros too. All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that…it gives me a massive nostalgia rush using it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/desktop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GPIO&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the picture below I have two instances of VS Code (both running dev containers), plus I’m browsing. It takes it all in its stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/pi-400-desktop.png&quot; alt=&quot;GPIO&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve not tried building anything huge…but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for having fun…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and I’m &lt;strong&gt;absolutely having fun&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Raspberry Pi 400 - First Impressions</og:title>
<og:description>These are my first impressions of the new Raspberry Pi 400, and my experiences of setting it up as a machine for development and blogging.</og:description>

<title>Show HN: Please-unsubscribe.com – fwd emails to unsubscribe from marketing</title>
<link>https://please-unsubscribe.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://please-unsubscribe.com</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/base.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;title/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;95.063069908815&quot;&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we will take care of the rest. &lt;a href=&quot;https://please-unsubscribe.com/example/&quot;&gt;Here is an example.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://please-unsubscribe.com/hall-of-shame/&quot;&gt;HALL OF SHAME&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;distinct users today: 53&lt;br/&gt;requests receieved today: 91&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pricing model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: After some input, I have decided to change billing to a credit-based system. Each unsubscribe uses &lt;strong&gt;1 Credit&lt;/strong&gt;. Over time, you should need this service less and less :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh accounts start with &lt;strong&gt;5 Credits&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credits are initially locked to the source email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your email is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://please-unsubscribe.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c4aeabacaaeab7a9adb0ac84a1bca5a9b4a8a1eaa7aba9&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, then your credits will only work with that email address. To change your source email address (or add a member), please message: &lt;a href=&quot;https://please-unsubscribe.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e89b9d9898879a9ca898848d899b8dc59d869b9d8a9b8b9a818a8dc68b8785&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bbc8cecbcbd4c9cffbcbd7dedac8de96ced5c8ced9c8d8c9d2d9de95d8d4d6&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can add multiple members of your family or friends to share a single credit pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Package&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;10 Credits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;25 Credits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;100 Credits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monthly plain-text report will be delivered via email. In the future, we might add a setting to enable weekly reports -- but hey, we're trying to unclog your inbox, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sign up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no sign-up form! Just forward any marketing email to &lt;a href=&quot;https://please-unsubscribe.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7dfd2cef7c7dbd2d6c4d29ac2d9c4c2d5c4d4c5ded5d299d4d8da&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f39b968ab3839f96928096de869d8086918090819a9196dd909c9e&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we will create an account for you on our backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to worry about billing until you expend your initial credits. Once that happens, we will send you a form to enroll in a plan via Stripe or Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your account's credits have been depleted, your emails will still be queued for processing -- but they won't be processed until you top-off your account again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emails are processed in a FIFO (First-in, First-out) queue. Typically, they are completed within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no automation. Oftentimes, these marketing emails contain hard-to-find, low-opacity links. But it's nothing that a real human can't tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the only processor is my high-school sister. I pay her $15/hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, automation might be worth it. But for right now, hiring a real human is a pretty good deal for the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*We will never sell data.*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emails we are targeting are marketing emails sent &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;. 9/10 times these emails don't disclose anything other than your &lt;strong&gt;email address&lt;/strong&gt;. Sometimes, they mention your &lt;strong&gt;first name&lt;/strong&gt; -- for a bit of a &lt;em&gt;&quot;personal touch&quot;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt;/sarcasm&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After processing, your emails will be placed in Gsuite's trash, which will be purged in 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aggregate anonymized statistics in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://please-unsubscribe.com/hall-of-shame&quot;&gt;HALL OF SHAME&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to be removed from these aggregates, please email &lt;a href=&quot;https://please-unsubscribe.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#186b6d6868776a6c5868747d796b7d356d766b6d7a6b7b6a717a7d367b7775&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e6d6b6e6e716c6a5e6e727b7f6d7b336b706d6b7c6d7d6c777c7b307d7173&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the subject &quot;opt-out&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US Government Continues Encryption War</title>
<link>https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-continues-encryption-war/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-continues-encryption-war/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity&quot;&gt;Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act&lt;/a&gt; is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds little to the security of the communications of the ordinary user, but it is a serious benefit for those who use the internet for illicit purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is plainly false. Encryption has as much benefit, if not more, for ordinary users. Encryption is used in every website that has the padlock sign (HTTP&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;), in every iPhone app since 2016, in every Android app since 2018 and in almost every modern application - and for good reason. Encryption helps protect sensitive information (such as that shared with your bank, or any time you use a password on a website). It may also help protect files which are not in use (at rest), or in the event the server is accessed by an unauthorised person (such as a criminal attempting to siphon off important data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Bruce Schneier wrote an article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/04/the_value_of_encrypt.html&quot;&gt;the value of encryption&lt;/a&gt; clearly outlining why encryption is needed. Schneier went on to say that when the US Government was &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars&quot;&gt;fighting cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, he wondered if they were aware how much they relied on it themselves. No-one is above the law, so if you ban strong encryption, the FBI should not use it either. Attorney General Barr, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/23/us_encryption_backdoor/&quot;&gt;gives the impression&lt;/a&gt; that the government, along with certain large companies, should have an exception to the law. Barr recognises that there are some things that are secret, but he doesn't recognise that regular citizens might also want to enjoy privacy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not talking about protecting the nation’s nuclear launch codes,” Barr told the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, because your average Joe does not have government level secrets, he is no longer entitled to encryption. We are all humans, and we all need privacy. By taking away encryption, you are taking away privacy online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This act is aimed at Section 230, which ensures that no interactive computer service provider shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of content published by their users - an essential part of the survival of all search engines, social media platforms and video sharing sites. Without it, the internet would become a self-censored platform – one that is more concerned with fending off lawsuits than providing a medium for ideas and innovation as it originally was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to sympathise with an act that is being pushed through on the grounds that terrorists, paedophiles and drug-dealers all use encryption. Reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/podcasts/the-daily/child-sex-abuse.html&quot;&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; on online images of  sexual abuse would leave some wondering why this sort of Act has not been passed already. Equally, if no-one had encryption then it would certainly be easier to catch above mentioned crooks and fellons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption, however, did not create these problems; these crimes were around long before it came into existence. In addition, those who partake in illicit activity will always find loopholes and ways to do so, such as using products or encryption tools that don't have backdoors. Criminals do not obey laws by definition. Furthermore, many innocent people use similar encryption to these criminals, but only to protect privacy, not hide any illegalities and yet they could still be subject to some kind of prosecution. It is assumed the use or possession of non-backdoored software would also become an offence if too many people used that instead. Statistically, it's agreed there are many more innocent people in society than criminals; those innocent people would be punished as a result of the bad actions of a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not feasible for a government to make a law of this sort that can apply outside of it's own country. Governments around the world would almost certainly disagree on which countries should be allowed access to the backdoor. As a result, this backdoor would most certainly lead to every unauthorised party having access, as the key to decrypt the data would be discovered by third parties, this would result in completely broken encryption for all. In federated networks, such as Matrix, it's not even possible to add a backdoor to every homeserver. Federation decentralises trust, which means that the person deploying the server isn't necessarily the same entity who makes the client software or server software. Matrix has even written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors&quot;&gt;thorough article&lt;/a&gt; on how to combat this sort of abuse without backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakening encryption will only result in criminals using strong encryption anyway, without fighting any of the problems that the the law claims to solve. There is no easy solution, and it is down to politicians to provide one. Yes, encryption can be used by people with bad intentions, but it is also used by so many ordinary people who would never think to use it in a malicious way. Nearly every tool in life can be used for nefarious purposes, but does not mean it should be unavailable for legitimate non-criminal uses. You could hit someone with a hammer, but it doesn't mean hammers should be made out of foam, because if they were, people would just use knives instead. Weakening encryption will not solve these issues, and that's probably because they were not the the focus of the Act. Instead, it seems that this law seeks to criminalises strong encryption that does not have backdoors, even though the government knows full well that this will not stop criminals. The US Government should stop devising new ways to breach its citizens privacy, and focus on combating the issues that this Act fails to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Timothy May &lt;a href=&quot;https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that “the State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of [encryption], citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration”. He was spot on.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>US Government Continues Encryption War</og:title>
<og:description>Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement. This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds</og:description>

&lt;p id=&quot;abspara0010&quot;&gt;Some patients with severe brain injury show short-term neurological improvements, such as recovery of consciousness, motor function, or speech after administering zolpidem, a GABA receptor agonist. The working mechanism of this paradoxical phenomenon remains unknown. In this study, we used electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography to investigate a spectacular zolpidem-induced awakening, including the recovery of functional communication and the ability to walk in a patient with severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We show that cognitive deficits, speech loss, and motor impairments after severe brain injury are associated with stronger beta band connectivity throughout the brain and suggest that neurological recovery after zolpidem occurs with the restoration of beta band connectivity. This exploratory work proposes an essential role for beta rhythms in goal-directed behavior and cognition. It advocates further fundamental and clinical research on the role of increased beta band connectivity in the development of neurological deficits after severe brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
