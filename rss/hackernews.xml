&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheets are the world’s most widely used programming language, by several orders of magnitude. We asked ourselves whether it would be possible to apply programming language research ideas to make spreadsheets a better programming language? If we could, that would empower a huge user community to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of working at Microsoft Research is the ability to directly influence mainstream software technologies – in this case, Microsoft Excel. And the Excel product team has been excited to partner with us. The core ideas of our collaboration are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Excel’s data values reflect the datatypes of our end users’ domains, by adding arrays, vectors, records, and even domain-specific data types implemented by third parties. A first step is to make arrays—already a very natural data type for Excel—into first-class values that can be computed by any formula; see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/champagne-prototyping-research-technique-early-evaluation-complex-end-user-programming-systems/&quot;&gt;Champagne Prototyping: A Research Technique for Early Evaluation of Complex End-User Programming Systems&lt;/a&gt; (VLHCC’04).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Excel functions reflect the abstractions of our end users, by allowing end-users to define new functions using an ordinary worksheet, rather than by switching to a totally different language (and computation paradigm) such as Visual Basic. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-user-centred-approach-to-functions-in-excel/&quot;&gt;A User-Centred Approach to Functions in Excel&lt;/a&gt; (ICFP’03).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through deep collaboration between Microsoft Research Cambridge and the Microsoft Excel product team, Excel is now moving decisively to reflect these core principles. The first pieces have already appeared: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbImc7A8_Q8&quot;&gt;an Excel cell can now contain a first-class record&lt;/a&gt;, linked to external data sources. And ordinary Excel formulas can now compute array values, that “spill” into adjacent cells (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Excel-Blog/Preview-of-Dynamic-Arrays-in-Excel/ba-p/252944&quot;&gt;dynamic arrays&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_559830&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-559830&quot; src=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/msr_blog_pl_spreadsheets_exercise--1024x775.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;775&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/msr_blog_pl_spreadsheets_exercise--1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/msr_blog_pl_spreadsheets_exercise--300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/msr_blog_pl_spreadsheets_exercise--768x581.jpg 768w, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/01/msr_blog_pl_spreadsheets_exercise--80x60.jpg 80w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The Calc Intelligence team and Excel colleagues sharing a moment at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more to come: we have a working version of full, higher-order, lexically-scoped lambdas (and let-expressions) in Excel’s formula language and we are prototyping sheet-defined functions and full nesting of array values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://aka.ms/calcintel&quot;&gt;Calc Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; project works at the boundary between programming language research and human experience and design. This interdisciplinary work has thrown up interesting new ideas that will extend the reach and ambition of what end users can achieve with Excel, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calc View&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditional programming sees programs principally as textual code, with the data being delayed until runtime. In contrast, spreadsheet programming focuses on the data and its visualisation, with the code (the formulas) being almost entirely hidden. What if we were to provide both views at once? The grid would sit side-by-side with a textual “calculation view”, that could give far more insight into the computations that are going on, illuminated by comments, layout, and all the other mechanisms that programmers use to make their code robust, modular, and long-lived. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/calculation-view-multiple-representation-editing-in-spreadsheets/&quot;&gt;Calculation View: multiple-representation editing in spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt; (VLHCC 2018).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elastic Sheet Defined Functions&lt;/strong&gt;. End-users will initially define new user-defined functions on fixed-size arrays, but we would like to generalize them to work on arbitrary-sized arrays. You could come up with ad-hoc ways to do this for special cases, but could we imagine a principal generalisation of a single example to arbitrary sized inputs? We did. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/elastic-sheet-defined-functions-generalising-spreadsheet-functions-to-variable-size-input-arrays/&quot;&gt;Elastic Sheet-Defined Functions: Generalising Spreadsheet Functions to Variable-Size Input Arrays&lt;/a&gt; (in submission).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, the needs of end users have driven us in intriguing (and often technically-demanding) new research directions. Our internal prototypes and strong cross-company relationships provide wonderful intellectual opportunities for research here in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside our long-term partnership with the Excel team, we have close connections with researchers at other Microsoft Research labs who work on spreadsheets. For example, research by our colleagues at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/extracting-top-k-insights-multi-dimensional-data/&quot;&gt;extracting insights from multi-dimensional datasets&lt;/a&gt; has influenced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/ideas-in-excel-3223aab8-f543-4fda-85ed-76bb0295ffc4&quot;&gt;Ideas feature&lt;/a&gt; in Excel, while recent research from Microsoft Research Redmond, Washington shows how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/melford-using-neural-networks-find-spreadsheet-errors/&quot;&gt;deep learning can find errors in spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office team is thinking creatively and broadly about how Office apps can evolve to embrace the opportunities that surround us. There is no better time to be working in Microsoft Research alongside the product teams to change the future!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU Cancels &amp;#039;Final&amp;#039; Negotiations on EU Copyright Directive</title>
<link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190118/11062441423/eu-cancels-final-negotiations-eu-copyright-directive-as-it-becomes-clear-there-isnt-enough-support.shtml</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190118/11062441423/eu-cancels-final-negotiations-eu-copyright-directive-as-it-becomes-clear-there-isnt-enough-support.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So, this is certainly unexpected. Just hours after we pointed out that even all of the lobbyists who had written/pushed for Article 13 in the EU Copyright Directive were now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190117/22221241417/record-labels-film-studios-tech-companies-public-now-all-agreed-that-article-13-is-disaster.shtml&quot;&gt;abandoning their support&lt;/a&gt; for it (basically because the EU was considering making it just slightly less awful), it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Senficon/status/1086335378141966336&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monday's negotiations have been called off entirely&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently multiple countries -- including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland -- made it clear they would not support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190117/16525641415/latest-eu-copyright-directive-still-demands-internet-companies-wave-magic-wands.shtml&quot;&gt;latest text&lt;/a&gt; put forth by Romania, and therefore would have blocked it from moving forward. Monday's negotiations were &lt;strong&gt;supposed&lt;/strong&gt; to have been the &quot;final&quot; negotiations (after the previous &quot;final&quot; negotiations that didn't accomplish much) around a &quot;compromise&quot; bill that then would have gone out to be voted on by the EU Council, the EU Committee and the EU Parliament in the next few months. However, with the news of all those countries (via the EU Council) deciding to vote against the proposal, it effectively blocks it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEP Julia Reda now has &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2019/01/copyright-hits_wall/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the full breakdown of the votes&lt;/a&gt;, noting that 11 countries voted against the &quot;compromise&quot; text: Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Croatia, Luxembourg and Portugal. That's... a pretty big list. Reda points out that most of those countries were concerned about the impact on &lt;strong&gt;users'&lt;/strong&gt; rights (Portugal and Croatia appear to be outliers). That's pretty big -- as it means that any new text (if there is one) should move in a better direction, not worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Reda notes, this does not mean that the Copyright Directive or Article 13 are dead. They could certainly be revived with new negotiations (and that could happen soon). But, it certainly makes the path forward a lot more difficult. Throughout all of this, as we've seen in the past, the legacy copyright players plowed forward, accepting no compromise and basically going for broke as fast as they could, in the hopes that no one would stop them. They've hit something of a stumbling block here. It won't stop them from still trying, but for now this is good news. The next step is making sure Article 13 is truly dead and cannot come back. The EU has done a big thing badly in even letting things get this far. Now let's hope they fix this mess by dumping Articles 11 and 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;b&quot;&gt;The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of Music Electronics Industry (AMEI) announce MIDI 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s2&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;b&quot;&gt;&lt;sup data-redactor-tag=&quot;sup&quot;&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;b&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;b&quot;&gt;Los Angeles, CA, January 18, 2019&lt;/strong&gt; – The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and AMEI (the Japanese MIDI association) have finalized the core features and name for the next generation MIDI protocol: MIDI 2.0. Member companies are currently working together to develop prototypes based on a jointly developed, feature-complete, draft specification. A members-only plugfest to test compatibility between some early MIDI 2.0 prototypes is planned for Winter NAMM 2019. Participating companies include Ableton/Cycling '74, Art+Logic, Bome Software, Google, imitone, Native Instruments, Roland, ROLI, Steinberg, TouchKeys, and Yamaha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;As with MIDI 1.0, AMEI and the MMA are working closely together and sharing code to streamline the prototype development process. Prototyping is planned to continue during 2019 as the associations work together on MIDI 2.0 launch plans, including exploring the development of a MIDI 2.0 logo and self-certification program for MMA and AMEI member companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;During the prototyping phase, the proposed MIDI 2.0 specification is available only to MMA and AMEI members, because the prototyping process may trigger minor enhancements to the specification. Once a final specification is adopted, it will join the current MIDI specifications as a free download on www.midi.org.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;The MIDI 2.0 initiative updates MIDI with auto-configuration, new DAW/web integrations, extended resolution, increased expressiveness, and tighter timing -- all while maintaining a high priority on backward compatibility. This major update of MIDI paves the way for a new generation of advanced interconnected MIDI devices, while still preserving interoperability with the millions of existing MIDI 1.0 devices. One of the core goals of the MIDI 2.0 initiative is to also enhance the MIDI 1.0 feature set whenever possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;All companies that develop MIDI products are encouraged to join the MMA to participate in the future development of the specification, and to keep abreast of other developments in MIDI technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;b&quot;&gt;About the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot; data-redactor-tag=&quot;span&quot; data-redactor-class=&quot;s1&quot; data-verified=&quot;redactor&quot;&gt;The MIDI Manufacturers Association is an international group of hardware and software companies working together to develop new MIDI specifications and promote MIDI technology.

<title>Former IBM exec says company told her to hide layoff age data from government</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/18/ibm_government_lying_claims/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/18/ibm_government_lying_claims/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A former senior executive at IBM has claimed she was ordered to lie to the US government about just how many older workers Big Blue was laying off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she says she was fired after pointing out that the aging biz was breaking age discrimination laws by primarily firing post-50 staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shocking allegations are found in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/01/18/catherine_rodgers_affidavit.pdf&quot;&gt;an affidavit&lt;/a&gt; filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York by Catherine Rodgers, formerly IBM's vice president in its Global Engagement Office. She claims her superiors directed her to hide information about staff leaving from the US Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describing the circumstances under which she was terminated after nearly four decades with IBM, Rodgers said she believes she was fired for raising concerns that IBM was engaged in systematic age discrimination against employees over the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, &lt;em&gt;Rusis et al v. IBM&lt;/em&gt;, was filed in September 2018. Along with similar age discrimination claims brought against IBM in California and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/09/ibm_age_iayoffs/&quot;&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, it followed a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://features.propublica.org/ibm/ibm-age-discrimination-american-workers/&quot;&gt;March 2018 report&lt;/a&gt; from ProPublica and Mother Jones that said the global IT biz over the past few years engaged in a systematic campaign to get rid of older workers. According to the exposé, about 60 per cent of the 20,000 people laid off over a five year period were over 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodgers is not a plaintiff in the New York case, however, but has one of her own. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt;, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, Shannon Liss-Riordan, a partner at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.llrlaw.com/&quot;&gt;Lichten &amp;amp; Liss-Riordan, PC&lt;/a&gt;, in Boston, explained Rodgers has a separate claim that will be filed against IBM alleging age discrimination and retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She will join a growing number of ex-IBMers suing the IT giant over alleged discrimination, including cloud sales lead &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/03/ibm_langley_age_discrimination/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Langley&lt;/a&gt; and mainframe industry veteran &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/07/ibm_age_discrimination_lawsuit/&quot;&gt;Terry Keebaugh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trouble at the top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodgers, who was 62 when fired on July 17, 2017, served as VP in IBM's global engagement office and senior state executive for Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of her senior position, Rodgers said she had access to all the people to be laid off in her group. All of them, she said, were over the age of 50, and younger workers were unaffected by the layoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having spoken with peer managers from other groups with younger populations, I am aware that the percentage of employees from my group who were laid off was vastly higher than the percentage of employees who were laid off from younger groups,&quot; she wrote in her court paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was directed to delete all but one name before I submitted the form to the Department of Labor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was very surprised that such a high percentage of my group was laid off, because my group was running under budget and was exceeding its performance targets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2017, she recounted, two employees who were over 50 and had been included in the layoff, filed a request for financial assistance from the Department of Labor under the Trade Assistance Act, a 2015 law that provides support for laid off workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a result, the Department of Labor sent me a form to fill out that asked me to state all of the employees within my group who had been laid off in the last three years and what their ages were,&quot; Rodgers said her affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I listed all of the employees in my group who had been laid off, all of whom were over the age of fifty. I reviewed this form with IBM HR, and I was directed to delete all but one name before I submitted the form to the Department of Labor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dirty deeds, done dirt cheap?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodgers also claims that other tactics were used to dissuade older staff from staying on. Despite more than a decade espousing the benefits of home working, Rodgers said that IBM began insisting that older staff came into the office daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also says older workers were more likely to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/09/ibm_workfromhome_cull_companywide/&quot;&gt;face relocation to new locations across the US&lt;/a&gt;. Very few chose to do so, forcing them into accepting retirement. One staffer she knew of did agree to relocate to Connecticut. IBM then reassigned her to an office in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodgers says that she herself received &quot;excellent performance evaluations,&quot; annually until she began raising questions. Shortly after doing so, she got her first ever negative performance review, despite meeting all her targets for the year. She was then given more and more work to do without a pay rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the 2017 performance review cycle, I was given a mediocre performance review even though my business results far exceeded mutually agreed-to business objectives,&quot; she stated in her filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My manager, Steve Welsh, indicated that my rating was directed from the top down by Richard Patterson, the general manager of Global Technology Services. Mr Welsh told me that Mr Patterson had not even looked at my business results when he directed the mediocre evaluation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs' &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/01/18/memorandum.pdf&quot;&gt;memorandum&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the affidavit asks the court to authorize the notification of former IBM employees around the US who are over 40 and lost their jobs since 2017 that they can join the legal proceedings against the mainframe giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liss-Riordan said that the process is called &quot;conditional certification,&quot; a preliminary step in age discrimination and federal wage cases. It's different from &quot;class certification,&quot; she said, which may be sought after discovery for state law claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been contacted by hundreds of employees and of those, more than a hundred had timely claims and have already joined the case either in court or arbitration,&quot; said Liss-Riordan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We submitted affidavits from a sampling of those employees describing their experience being let go by IBM. As you can see, they paint a very compelling and disturbing picture of a company intent on reducing its older workforce and replacing them with younger employees, and with a particular focus on hiring Millennials.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether she intends to argue that IBM directed Rodgers to lie to the government and whether she believes the claims could lead to a criminal complaint against the company, Liss-Riordan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the affidavit speaks for itself,&quot; she said. And it's plain others others think there could be more serious charges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Q2VKPT: Fully path traced Quake 2</title>
<link>http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;77.062058130401&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q2VKPT&lt;/h2&gt;
Q2VKPT is the first playable game that is entirely raytraced and efficiently simulates fully dynamic lighting in real-time, with the same modern techniques as used in the movie industry (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLwRLS_ZR0&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Disney's practical guide to path tracing&lt;/a&gt;). The recent release of GPUs with raytracing capabilities has opened up entirely new possibilities for the future of game graphics, yet making good use of raytracing is non-trivial. While some games have started to explore improvements in shadow and reflection rendering, Q2VKPT is the first project to implement an efficient unified solution for all types of light transport: direct, scattered, and reflected light (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#media&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;). This kind of unification has led to a dramatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://jo.dreggn.org/path-tracing-in-production/2018/&quot;&gt;increase in both flexibility and productivity in the movie industry&lt;/a&gt;. The chance to have the same development in games promises a similar increase in visual fidelity and realism for game graphics in the coming years.
&lt;p&gt;This project is meant to serve as a proof-of-concept for computer graphics research and the game industry alike, and to give enthusiasts a glimpse into the potential future of game graphics. Besides the use of hardware-accelerated raytracing, Q2VKPT mainly gains its efficiency from &lt;a href=&quot;https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/atf.php&quot;&gt;an adaptive image filtering technique&lt;/a&gt; that intelligently tracks changes in the scene illumination to re-use as much information as possible from previous computations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
The project is released as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cschied/q2vkpt/&quot;&gt;open source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, integrating our Vulkan path tracer into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://skuller.net/q2pro/&quot;&gt;Q2PRO&lt;/a&gt; client. The project was spawned by the need for fast-paced test content in computer graphics research, and was motivated by the first intriguing results of an experimental path tracing renderer &lt;a href=&quot;https://amietia.com/q2pt.html&quot;&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
VKPT and Q2VKPT were created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/c_schied&quot;&gt;Christoph Schied&lt;/a&gt; as a spare-time project to validate the results of computer graphics research in an actual game. The project currently encompasses 12K lines of code and completely replaces the original Quake II graphics code. Initially, it was prototyped in OpenGL with contributions by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jo.dreggn.org/home&quot;&gt;Johannes Hanika&lt;/a&gt; (Experimental Ray Tracing, Shaders, GL/Vulkan Fixes), Addis Dittebrandt (Light Hierarchy, Debug Visualisation), &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alphanew&quot;&gt;Tobias Zirr&lt;/a&gt; (Light Sampling, Hack Supervision and Instigation, Website, Info Texts), and Florian Reibold (Initial Light Hierarchy). Additional help was provided by Stephan Bergmann, Emanuel Schrade, Alisa Jung, and Christoph Peters (&lt;a href=&quot;http://momentsingraphics.de/?p=127&quot;&gt;made some noise&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
Q2VKPT is implemented in the Vulkan API to be able to use the new hardware-accelerated raytracing features that were made available earlier this year. Thanks to these, the game can actually come close to 60 FPS (2560x1440, RTX2080Ti), while being fully raytraced and dynamically shaded with realistic global lighting models in real-time. Using path tracing for fully dynamic lighting allows for a lot more detail in the shading of game scenes, naturally producing complex interplay of hard and soft shadows, glossy material appearances and perspectively correct reflections everywhere. Moreover, light can naturally flow anywhere, tying the scene together in the ways we would expect from the real world. Traditional approaches like precomputed lighting or coarse real-time raster approximations could never interactively reach this detail at a comparable resolution, since full storage of this lighting information would exceed any memory bounds.
&lt;h2&gt;Technical Details&lt;/h2&gt;
Q2VKPT makes use of a variety of techniques to adapt computationally expensive methods previously only used in the movie industry to games. At the core is an adaptive temporal filter that intelligently re-uses the results of previous frames (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/atf.php&quot;&gt;a former research project of Christoph's&lt;/a&gt;). On top of the nowadays well-established temporal anti-aliasing, this filter extends the tracking of changes over time from mere image space to the high-dimensional space of light transport paths. Path change tracking is necessary because path tracing is a randomized algorithm, which is both its strength and its weakness: While it can generically handle all kinds of light transport, results may need a long time to become reliable, too long for one frame in a real-time game. A mere image-space approach like temporal anti-aliasing cannot deal with this amount of uncertainty.
&lt;p&gt;On top of temporal filtering, we have explored several techniques of finding the lights that influence each surface in the game. Picking the right lights is crucial for image quality, since picking the wrong lights results in highly unreliable pathtracer output, which then forces the temporal filter to remove all the beautiful details we wanted the pathtracer to produce in the first place. An initial prototype used a full light hierarchy as is also common in movie production: By clustering lights hierarchically, the influence of many lights can be estimated at once, allowing for quick exclusion of far-away, dim lights and of lights pointing the wrong way. However, such estimates turned out hard to get precise, and the computational cost of traversing the hierarchy hard to control. Since Quake II originally shipped with a Potentially-Visible-Set for culling occluded parts of the scene, we instead resorted to extracting lists of potentially visible lights from these sets for every part of the scene. In the current version, we implemented a semi-accurate estimation of the influence of every light in the list, by randomly picking a representative subset of these lists in every frame. Thus, the renderer quickly hits all light sources over time, and we can also do all influence estimation in a controlled, constant time budget. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why does the game crash for me?&lt;/h4&gt;
We are very sorry, since this is a spare-time project, we do not have the capacity for thorough quality assurance testing. You are welcome to file a bug report into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cschied/q2vkpt/issues/&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; of our GitHub repository! &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why are there no particles? I want my flies and rail gun sparks back!&lt;/h4&gt;
Unfortunately, we ran out of time to add lights for the rail gun. As to other particles, the decision to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#tech&quot;&gt;fully raytrace everything&lt;/a&gt; in the game made rendering particles a bit less trivial. If we find the time, we might fix it in the future! &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Games already look real today! Why would they use path tracing?&lt;/h4&gt;
Today's games have taken the capabilities of traditional rasterization-based graphics very far. However, these advancements come with a price: The rendering engines of modern games have become extremely complex heaps of special-purpose techniques. Lighting, shadows and reflections each have to be computed at many different resolutions and scales, in order to ensure an acceptably artifact-free visual experience. Path tracing and other Monte Carlo Rendering techniques could open up a way out of this ever-growing complexity. In fact, it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://jo.dreggn.org/path-tracing-in-production/2018/&quot;&gt;already achieved that for the movie industry&lt;/a&gt;. This prototype is a first step towards answering a few of the open questions on how to accomplish the same in the games industry. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Quake II is ancient! If these techniques have any future, it should run at 6000 FPS by now!&lt;/h4&gt;
While it is true that Quake II is a relatively old game with rather low geometric complexity, the limiting factor of path tracing is not primarily raytracing or geometric complexity. In fact, the current prototype could trace many more rays without a notable change in frame rate. The computational cost of the techniques used in the Q2VKPT prototype mainly depend on the number of (indirect) light scattering computations and the number of light sources. Quake II was already designed with many light sources when it was first released, in that sense it is still quite a modern game. Also, the number of light scattering events does not depend on scene complexity. It is therefore thinkable that the techniques we use could well scale up to more recent games. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why Quake II?&lt;/h4&gt;
Since Quake II is open source and has a long-standing modding tradition, it is a great sandbox for putting academic research to the test in the real world. Particularly, the game has fast-paced action and is played competitively, setting high standards for the performance and robustness of any implemented rendering techniques. Finally, in some sense Quake II is to this day quite a modern game, since it already shipped with complex and artistic light design back when it was first released. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can I use Q2VKPT as a benchmarking tool?&lt;/h4&gt;
Open the console using the &quot;~&quot; key. Depending whether you are using the demo or the full version of Quake 2 you can use &quot;timedemo 1; demo q2demo1&quot; or &quot;timedemo 1; demo demo1&quot; respectively. You can enable the inbuilt profiler using &quot;vkpt_profiler 1&quot; to get details about the GPU timings for the individual rendering steps.
&lt;h4&gt;How is path tracing different from raytracing?&lt;/h4&gt;
Path tracing is an elegant algorithm that can simulate many of the complex ways that light travels and scatters in virtual scenes. Its physically-based simulation of light allows highly realistic rendering. Path tracing uses Raytracing in order to determine the visibility in-between scattering events. However, Raytracing is merely a primitive operation that can be used for many things. Therefore, Raytracing alone does not automatically produce realistic images. Light transport algorithms like Path tracing can be used for that. However, while elegant and very powerful, naive path tracing is very costly and takes a long time to produce stable images. This project uses a smart &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#tech&quot;&gt;adaptive filter&lt;/a&gt; that re-uses as much information as possible across many frames and pixels in order to produce robust and stable images. &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#top&quot; class=&quot;top-a&quot;&gt;↑&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Are path tracing and raytracing the future of game graphics?&lt;/h4&gt;
The recent release of GPUs with raytracing capabilities has opened up entirely new possibilities for the future of game graphics, yet making good use of raytracing is non-trivial. The purpose of this project is to find out exactly what's still missing for a clearer pathway into a raytraced future of game graphics. While some problems have already been addressed by academic research, many open real-world problems slip unnoticed until one actually tries to implement a full game renderer. We plan to look into some of these issues, like better light sampling, better filtering, and more consistent renderer software architecture in the future. Good solutions for the new, different issues of raytracing- and path tracing-based renderers will be necessary for this change to happen on a broad scale.
&lt;h4&gt;Will path tracing finally solve all graphics problems?&lt;/h4&gt;
Path tracing and similar methods elegantly solve many hard problems of game graphics. However, their randomized nature also introduces a whole new set of challenges in order to be able to produce clean (noise-free) high-quality images. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://brechpunkt.de/q2vkpt/#tech&quot;&gt;filtering method in the Q2VKPT prototype&lt;/a&gt; is a first step towards robust unified methods that allow a fully unified, brute-force path tracing approach to rendering. We expect and hope to see more research into that direction in the next months and years!
&lt;h4&gt;Does Q2VKPT use the original light maps?&lt;/h4&gt;
The original Quake 2 engine uses precomputed light maps that contain soft shadows and diffuse indirect illumination. In contrast, Q2VKPT entirely replaces the static illumination using a fully dynamic simulation that unifies both the static and dynamic light sources.
&lt;h4&gt;How many rays does Q2VKPT cast per pixel?&lt;/h4&gt;
The number of rays that are cast are dependent on the first visible surface. For opaque surfaces Q2VKPT uses one ray each to find the direct and indirectly visible surface. Additionally, for both surfaces Q2VKPT casts one ray each towards randomly chosen light sources. Therefore Q2VKPT will cast at least 4 rays for each pixel.
&lt;h4&gt;Does Q2VKPT rely on rasterization?&lt;/h4&gt;
Traditionally, games use the rasterizer to find the surfaces visible from the camera. Q2VKPT is fully raytraced and does not rely on the rasterizer (except for the 2D user interface elements).

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the sugar industry funded research that downplayed the risks of sugar and highlighted the hazards of fat, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548255&quot;&gt;a newly published article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article draws on internal documents to show that an industry group called the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to &quot;refute&quot; concerns about sugar's possible role in heart disease. The SRF then sponsored research by Harvard scientists that did just that. The result was published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in 1967, with no disclosure of the sugar industry funding.&lt;/p&gt;

The Rest Of Food Industry Pays For Lots Of Research, Too&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sugar-funded project in question was a literature review, examining a variety of studies and experiments. It suggested there were major problems with all the studies that implicated sugar, and concluded that cutting fat out of American diets was the best way to address coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new article say that for the past five decades, the sugar industry has been attempting to influence the scientific debate over the relative risks of sugar and fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,&quot; co-author Stanton Glantz &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html?action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;amp;module=Trending&amp;amp;version=Full&amp;amp;region=Marginalia&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot;&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money on the line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article, published Monday, authors Glantz, Cristin Kearns and Laura Schmidt aren't trying make the case for a link between sugar and coronary heart disease. Their interest is in the process. They say the documents reveal the sugar industry attempting to influence scientific inquiry and debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that they worked under some limitations — &quot;We could not interview key actors involved in this historical episode because they have died,&quot; they write. Other organizations were also advocating concerns about fat, they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no evidence that the SRF directly edited the manuscript published by the Harvard scientists in 1967, but there is &quot;circumstantial&quot; evidence that the interests of the sugar lobby shaped the conclusions of the review, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, there's motivation and intent. In 1954, the researchers note, the president of the SRF gave a speech describing a great business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Americans could be persuaded to eat a lower-fat diet — for the sake of their health — they would need to replace that fat with something else. America's per capita sugar consumption could go up by a third&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res493747943&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage451950106&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/27/451950106/in-soda-politics-big-soda-at-crossroads-of-profit-and-public-health&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thesalt\/2015\/10\/27\/451950106\/in-soda-politics-big-soda-at-crossroads-of-profit-and-public-health&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/10/27/31_sq-6b6889dabdacd9501c77e4ed12ff0cf7280f2eb5-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/10/27/31_sq-6b6889dabdacd9501c77e4ed12ff0cf7280f2eb5-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;In 'Soda Politics,' Big Soda At Crossroads Of Profit And Public Health&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the '60s, the SRF became aware of &quot;flowing reports that sugar is a less desirable dietary source of calories than other carbohydrates,&quot; as John Hickson, SRF vice president and director of research, put it in one document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recommended that the industry fund its own studies — &quot;Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, after several scientific articles were published suggesting a link between sucrose and coronary heart disease, the SRF approved the literature-review project. It wound up paying approximately $50,000 in today's dollars for the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the researchers was the chairman of Harvard's Public Health Nutrition Department — and an ad hoc member of SRF's board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A different standard&quot; for different studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glantz, Kearns and Schmidt say many of the articles examined in the review were hand-selected by SRF, and it was implied that the sugar industry would expect them to be critiqued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res493747963&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage214440426&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/08/23/214440426/obesity-and-the-toxic-sugar-wars&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/13.7\/2013\/08\/23\/214440426\/obesity-and-the-toxic-sugar-wars&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/22/istock-19961325-sugar-spoons_sq-8380af41768c6308ac6466242ddae0e1487cf409-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/08/22/istock-19961325-sugar-spoons_sq-8380af41768c6308ac6466242ddae0e1487cf409-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Obesity And The Toxic-Sugar Wars&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter, SRF's Hickson said that the organization's &quot;particular interest&quot; was in evaluating studies focused on &quot;carbohydrates in the form of sucrose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are well aware,&quot; one of the scientists replied, &quot;and will cover this as well as we can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project wound up taking longer than expected, because more and more studies were being released that suggested sugar might be linked to coronary heart disease. But it was finally published in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickson was certainly happy with the result: &quot;Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print,&quot; he told one of the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/INTEMED/0/ISC160005supp1_prod.pdf&quot;&gt;minimized the significance&lt;/a&gt; of research that suggested sugar could play a role in coronary heart disease. In some cases the scientists alleged investigator incompetence or flawed methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is always appropriate to question the validity of individual studies,&quot; Kearns &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-12/how-big-sugar-enlisted-harvard-scientists-to-influence-how-we-eat-in-1965&quot;&gt;told Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; via email. But, she says, &quot;the authors applied a different standard&quot; to different studies — looking very critically at research that implicated sugar, and ignoring problems with studies that found dangers in fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies of sugar consumption — which look at patterns of health and disease in the real world — were dismissed for having too many possible factors getting in the way. Experimental studies were dismissed for being too dissimilar to real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study that found a health benefit when people ate less sugar and more vegetables was dismissed because that dietary change was not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, in which rats were given a diet low in fat and high in sugar, was rejected because &quot;such diets are rarely consumed by man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harvard researchers then turned to studies that examined risks of fat — which included the same kind of epidemiological studies they had dismissed when it came to sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing &quot;few study characteristics and no quantitative results,&quot; as Kearns, Glantz and Schmidt put it, they concluded that cutting out fat was &quot;no doubt&quot; the best dietary intervention to prevent coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugar lobby: &quot;Transparency standards were not the norm&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Sugar Association — which evolved out of the SRF — said it is challenging to comment on events from so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We acknowledge that the Sugar Research Foundation should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, however, when the studies in question were published funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today,&quot; the association said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Generally speaking, it is not only unfortunate but a disservice that industry-funded research is branded as tainted,&quot; the statement continues. &quot;What is often missing from the dialogue is that industry-funded research has been informative in addressing key issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents in question are five decades old, but the larger issue is of the moment, as Marion Nestle &lt;a href=&quot;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251&quot;&gt;notes in a commentary&lt;/a&gt; in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;edTag&quot; readability=&quot;5.9810126582278&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the article authors who dug into the documents around this funding, they offer two suggestions for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies,&quot; they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also call for new research into any ties between added sugars and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Documents show that in the '60s, the sugar industry funded Harvard researchers who, examining risk factors of heart disease, dismissed concerns about sugar and doubled down on the dangers of fat.</og:description>

<description>&lt;h3 name=&quot;9c1f&quot; id=&quot;9c1f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf--leading&quot;&gt;Introduction &amp;amp; Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*PnW2piQFIIHx7eNHGzMDAQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;300&quot; data-height=&quot;300&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PnW2piQFIIHx7eNHGzMDAQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;01a6&quot; id=&quot;01a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I knew I wanted a job in the Bay Area where I could really grow from a mobile perspective at a larger company. I’ve worked at startups before and I’ve loved it, but for a few reasons, I was looking at the big fish this go-around (in terms of valuation, not strictly team size). I also knew that I wasn’t positive where I wanted to work or how much compensation I’d need to match what I’m making now. I &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; knew I didn’t want to apply to 100+ places like I did when I was graduating from college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2218&quot; id=&quot;2218&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All told, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I applied to 20 companies&lt;/strong&gt;. I was &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;explicitly rejected by 4&lt;/strong&gt; of those companies (Reddit, Nest, Stripe, Uber) after applying. Of the remaining 16, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;10 companies never responded&lt;/strong&gt; to me either way (Lyft, Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, YouTube, Square, Robinhood, Twitter, Snap, Slack). Math dictates &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;6 companies followed up with a recruiter screen&lt;/strong&gt;. Of those 6 companies, I was able to get &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;phone screens with 6&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;onsites with 6&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;offers from 6&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;be8b&quot; id=&quot;be8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Reviewing my Google Calendar, I believe I had (approximately):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;b13e&quot; id=&quot;b13e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;7 recruiter screens in 10 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8061&quot; id=&quot;8061&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;7 technical screens in 11 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2c3f&quot; id=&quot;2c3f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;29 onsite interviews in 8 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5480&quot; id=&quot;5480&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;3 follow-up phone interviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;05fa&quot; id=&quot;05fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Adding up the above says &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I had 46 interviews in 73 days&lt;/strong&gt; (including gaps between each step). It was exhausting and it meant that most of my lunch breaks were just interviews for multiple weeks. I had to start going into work very early so I could leave earlier to take calls at home. Making sure I was still meeting all of my commitments at work was a challenge, too, but I made sure to prioritize that over interviewing, rescheduling when necessary. I wouldn’t phone it in for the purposes of interviewing. It makes you look bad, it’s unethical, and if you don’t get a job, you’re now a lower performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e760&quot; id=&quot;e760&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Companies, in order&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;b63f&quot; id=&quot;b63f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;LinkedIn (Sunnyvale, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*JjnojejxqDmKWdDvF7JccQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JjnojejxqDmKWdDvF7JccQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3QlCJzPEg_zN9xFKl2Ssyg.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3QlCJzPEg_zN9xFKl2Ssyg.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60).
&lt;p name=&quot;0693&quot; id=&quot;0693&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;LinkedIn’s mobile apps are actually pretty slick and they have some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/linkedin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=objective-c&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/linkedin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=objective-c&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solid contributions&lt;/a&gt; to the open source community. I was very impressed throughout the entire interview process with LinkedIn from both a culture perspective and an engineering perspective. They rose the highest on my mental list of iOS Prestige™ from the start of the process until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;96c0&quot; id=&quot;96c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yelp (San Francisco, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*FpLDHZQ6ZfuWA1-M.png&quot; data-width=&quot;100&quot; data-height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*FpLDHZQ6ZfuWA1-M.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*vUn3PlFo7XjucCyHbpMY7A.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*vUn3PlFo7XjucCyHbpMY7A.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60)
&lt;p name=&quot;e838&quot; id=&quot;e838&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Yelp has a really beautiful app with tons of iOS subtleties that show an understanding of the platform. I loved the vibe onsite. They have a beautiful building and I’d love to work with any of my interviewers. They’re much smaller than any of the other companies I applied to and it showed in all of the good ways. It seemed very tight knit and the process moved &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;10cc&quot; id=&quot;10cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Apple (Cupertino, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*IqpGHXo-3arOBJkB.png&quot; data-width=&quot;100&quot; data-height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*IqpGHXo-3arOBJkB.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5d37&quot; id=&quot;5d37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Apple’s been an important part of iOS for a while (har har). I grew up an extreme Apple fanboy (since the age of 12, at least). The Mac originally got me into programming. The iPhone SDK encouraged me to build and ship my first app. It was absolutely surreal to have them invite me onsite and later extend me an offer. I don’t know what else there is to say on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8e50&quot; id=&quot;8e50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Amazon (Palo Alto, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*mTsXIiKqWQ2vicuI.png&quot; data-width=&quot;100&quot; data-height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*mTsXIiKqWQ2vicuI.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*r07Al_J8C-J_xGbjx5CMbQ.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*r07Al_J8C-J_xGbjx5CMbQ.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60)
&lt;p name=&quot;4cea&quot; id=&quot;4cea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I wouldn’t consider Amazon a “mobile-first” as a company (at all). This position/team, though, met the criteria I laid out to start. I wasn’t in love with the Palo Alto building I was in specifically, but it’s a temporary office until they move into a more Amazon-y building, so it’s mostly poor interview timing on that front. The people I spoke to seemed pretty dedicated to their product. Although every company loved telling me that “&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;it really feels like a startup!&lt;/em&gt;”, it rang the truest at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;0aa9&quot; id=&quot;0aa9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Facebook (Menlo Park, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*wgM997D8y7JHguhRESY8pA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wgM997D8y7JHguhRESY8pA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TNBdVvsqr9Su44Ivj3T4eQ.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TNBdVvsqr9Su44Ivj3T4eQ.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60)
&lt;p name=&quot;9558&quot; id=&quot;9558&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I interviewed Facebook’s newest building. I thought it was really cool overall, although I’m somewhat hazy on the details about how the interview itself went because I was on my fifth consecutive day of interviewing with inadequate sleep. I do remember really enjoying the people I spoke with and having a very insightful lunch interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e54e&quot; id=&quot;e54e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Google (Mountain View, CA)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*VYDw0n3CgPOsrX1j-tchbw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VYDw0n3CgPOsrX1j-tchbw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pI4O9wNtDXv5uL6ehGJATg.jpeg&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pI4O9wNtDXv5uL6ehGJATg.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60)
&lt;p name=&quot;d356&quot; id=&quot;d356&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Google, to my understanding, does pretty “generic” interviews for a given role. I spoke to a lot of members from one of Google’s biggest products on iOS, but I wasn’t interviewing for a position specifically with that team. After I passed through Google’s hiring committee I moved on to the team matching phase and ultimately matched up with a team. It’s a very &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;loooooong&lt;/em&gt; process relative to the rest of the companies I spoke with, so I definitely had to keep everyone updated on where Google was. I also had to let Google know where I was with everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5abf&quot; id=&quot;5abf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Study Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;33c2&quot; id=&quot;33c2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;To be clear, I was starting from a position where I could probably do most Leetcode Easy problems in ~30 minutes, and I could maybe solve 25% of Leetcode Medium problems with infinite time. Solving Leetcode Hard problems were akin to trying to solve P=NP. In short, I had a large gap to bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba4b&quot; id=&quot;ba4b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To study algorithms &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I began first with&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On Sunday mornings I’d wake up and go to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/helbachs-coffee-house-madison&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/helbachs-coffee-house-madison&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coffee shop&lt;/a&gt; and grind out some problems in Objective-C. Once I did enough problems in CtCI (I think I solved ~35 problems) I would review a handful of Leetcode problems in the chapters I’d gone over. After a few weeks of this, I felt I had “the basics” down and moved on to my next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f89&quot; id=&quot;9f89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With the basics down, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I moved on to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1479274836/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1479274836/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Elements of Programming Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This book is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;considerably&lt;/em&gt; more difficult than CtCI. The book has recommended study plans that I stuck pretty closely with. I think there was one that planned on four weeks of studying and I got through almost all of it. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;It is critical, in my opinion, to either whiteboard problems with someone or mock a phone interview with someone&lt;/strong&gt;. Not critical as in “very important”, but critical as in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;you should consider it an absolute requirement when studying&lt;/em&gt;. I’m sure you can get a job without it, but it’s the single best form of practice I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d62&quot; id=&quot;9d62&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If anyone wants to mock phone interviews for iOS I’d be happy to help out — you may be able to find me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CS Career Hackers&lt;/a&gt; and maybe we can work something out, time permitting. If not me, there are plenty of others there willing to help out. It’ll be awkward. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;That’s the point&lt;/em&gt;. If it were natural you wouldn’t need to practice it, would you? &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;If you start practicing on the phone or on a whiteboard and it’s embarrassing or awkward, it’s a sign you’re doing exactly what you should be: practicing.&lt;/strong&gt; It was pretty awkward for me until it wasn’t, and the practice absolutely paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a611&quot; id=&quot;a611&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After about a month of consistently practicing problems each day (maybe 2–3 hours/day, more on weekends) I moved on to doing primarily Leetcode’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-interview-questions/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Top Interview Questions&lt;/a&gt;”. I didn’t do them all but I did “enough”. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;The key to preparing algorithm interviews is to get yourself to a point that you can figure out a problem during the interview,&lt;/strong&gt; not necessarily to know how to do every problem. That’s impossible. Almost all of the questions I heard over my week of onsites were “new” to me yet similar to questions I’d seen. That’s how most development goes in the industry, too. You have a lot of similar problems but your particular use case has special constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6601&quot; id=&quot;6601&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a21f&quot; id=&quot;a21f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’m going to present a bunch of lessons I learned as bullet points in no particular order. Everything listed below is something I wish I knew beforehand, both in terms of preparation on the technical side and in terms of scheduling and other non-technical tips. &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;These lessons are not iOS-specific and I’d imagine are generally applicable to all interviews in our industry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;9449&quot; id=&quot;9449&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;📚 &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Stick with it.&lt;/strong&gt; When I was looking for a job out of school I gave up after one or two weeks of studying. I reasoned that I simply was not cut out to learn the stuff. There was minimal progress from when I first started for weeks, so what was the point of wasting any more time? This time around, I figured I didn’t have a choice. Eventually, things started falling into place. It’s a lot of work, but the willingness to learn is what separates successful candidates from the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;21e4&quot; id=&quot;21e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🤓 Practice is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everything.&lt;/strong&gt; You certainly need a baseline of innate ability, but practice (i.e. learning) can fill in &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wide ability gaps. Companies don’t hire people based on the knowledge they were born with. They hire those that can perform their duties and perform them well, regardless of where/when they cultivated the knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0bde&quot; id=&quot;0bde&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;👫 Practicing with a friend is everything &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether on a whiteboard or on something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeshare.io/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://codeshare.io/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Codeshare&lt;/a&gt;, simulating an interview environment with someone over a period of time takes a lot of the scariness out of interviews. You get over the awkwardness of verbalizing something totally stupid to someone because your brain slipped. The best is if you can make sure someone understands a problem you haven’t seen before, as they can give you hints to push you toward a solution. Seriously, that kind of practice is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;invaluable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d4b7&quot; id=&quot;d4b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;📊 It’s a numbers game.&lt;/strong&gt; You can practice — effectively, even — and not land a job because the right person didn’t see your resumé or you just didn’t see a solution to a whiteboard problem in time. The best you can hope to do is maximize your odds. This means applying everywhere you would like to work and fit a job req and not just your top choice. I applied for my top 20!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4ee8&quot; id=&quot;4ee8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🤔 Focus on the problem solving, not the solution.&lt;/strong&gt; Memorization isn’t enough. Of ~20 algorithm problems I saw in a week I had seen maybe one of the problems before (and I let my interviewer know, though many would disagree with that choice). I just saw lots of common patterns and I was able to come up with solutions on the fly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4b65&quot; id=&quot;4b65&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;😣 Don’t get discouraged.&lt;/strong&gt; There were multiple interviews I had where I didn’t know the solution and interviewers had to shepherd me towards a solution. I still got offers from everywhere I interviewed. Also, I felt I absolutely &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;bombed&lt;/em&gt; one of my interviews (four of my five that day I thought were solid “no hires”) and the company later extended me an offer. Anything can happen, evidently. :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a465&quot; id=&quot;a465&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🤯 Don’t be quick to disregard problems.&lt;/strong&gt; There were multiple times I was practicing with a friend of mine and he shrugged off particularly difficult problems as pointless to know. Curiously enough, of the four types of problems I recall him saying would “never” come up, two of them did. Not in the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; form we were going to practice, but very similar. If your practice shows a certain concept come up frequently, learn it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;bf88&quot; id=&quot;bf88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🧐 Don’t underestimate the importance of behavioral questions&lt;/strong&gt;. I think I enjoyed a lot of success because my (honest) answers were what companies wanted. It’s my theory that many developers have strong technical skills and still struggle to find their perfect job because they’re rude, dishonest, or uncomfortable speaking to people outside of a technical setting. These are all justifiable reasons to reject a candidate, in my opinion. Practice them just as you would technical questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;340f&quot; id=&quot;340f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;🧠 If you know more, show it.&lt;/strong&gt; There were multiple examples during my onsites where I would answer a question and mention some other knowledge I had but explain that I didn’t have time in an interview to fully implement that solution. Answering a question about strings? Show off your Unicode knowledge with your solution or explain how to support Unicode. Implementing a private method? Talk about the Objective-C conventions for methods. Updating a table view? Talk about the different animations you can support. Don’t bring something up if you can’t talk all about it, but if you can, it allows you to show knowledge outside of the narrow window provided by the question and gives you a leg up on anyone that sticks strictly to the beaten path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a006&quot; id=&quot;a006&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;💪 Don’t strive to clear the bar, strive to set it.&lt;/strong&gt; Interview performance obviously helps decide if you get an offer from a given company, but it also helps decide what that offer looks like. If you get to a point where you think you know enough to get an offer, that’s great. But keep in mind there’s a big difference between “barely good enough” and “absolutely good enough”. Strive for the latter! My initial (i.e. not negotiated) offers came in pretty solid despite my relative lack of experience and I believe interview performance played a big role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 name=&quot;a319&quot; id=&quot;a319&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Wrap-Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f148&quot; id=&quot;f148&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;So that’s that! It was a crazy ride and I have no regrets. I truly, genuinely hope that the above can help someone get over the hump when it comes to landing a job they’ve dreamed about. If there’s particular interest in iOS-specific help, I can publish some tips, so please comment and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d7eb&quot; id=&quot;d7eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If it’s of any use: I was interviewing for my second job out of college with about two and a half years of experience without any particularly notable internships or employers on my resume; I went to a very small school that had zero known software companies at their “career fair”; I started preparing in late April and started applying in June/July; and, lastly, a few months in, my job is everything I could have possibly dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e24&quot; id=&quot;0e24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I’d like to shout out the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cscareerhackers.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;CS Career Hackers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;community one last time.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re looking for a place to practice and talk with others in similar situations (or those that have been through it on either side), please do check it out. 👍 I didn’t find it until a few months after I signed my offer, but it’s a great place nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cf0f&quot; id=&quot;cf0f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Happy studying, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e801&quot; id=&quot;e801&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;ok, technically, it was six weekdays and eight days; no, I didn’t interview on a Saturday :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Future of TypeScript on ESLint</title>
<link>https://eslint.org/blog/2019/01/future-typescript-eslint</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://eslint.org/blog/2019/01/future-typescript-eslint</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, the TypeScript team shared their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29288&quot;&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; in which they described formally adopting ESLint in their repo and working to improve TypeScript compatibility for ESLint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;linting&quot;&gt;Linting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Semantic rules in ESLint
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parity with TSLint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed &amp;amp; scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editor integration for ESLint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a survey we ran in VS Code a few months back, the most frequent theme we heard from users was that the linting experience left much to be desired. Since part of our team is dedicated to editing experiences in JavaScript, our editor team set out to add support for both TSLint and ESLint. However, we noticed that there were a few architectural issues with the way TSLint rules operate that impacted performance. Fixing TSLint to operate more efficiently would require a different API which would break existing rules (unless an interop API was built like what wotan provides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ESLint already has the more-performant architecture we’re looking for from a linter. Additionally, different communities of users often have lint rules (e.g. rules for React Hooks or Vue) that are built for ESLint, but not TSLint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, our editor team will be focusing on leveraging ESLint rather than duplicating work. For scenarios that ESLint currently doesn’t cover (e.g. semantic linting or program-wide linting), we’ll be working on sending contributions to bring ESLint’s TypeScript support to parity with TSLint. As an initial testbed of how this works in practice, we’ll be switching the TypeScript repository over to using ESLint, and sending any new rules upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, just like a lot of the JavaScript and TypeScript communities, were very excited about this announcement. Several members of the ESLint team have been working on improving TypeScript compatibility over the past couple of years, including James Henry, Kai Cataldo, Kevin Partington, Toru Nagashima, and Nicholas Zakas. That work focused mainly on the TypeScript parser, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eslint/typescript-eslint-parser&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint-parser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and partly on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bradzacher/eslint-plugin-typescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eslint-plugin-typescript&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was not maintained by the ESLint team but had been maintained by Nicholas and James until recently). The Typescript parser would undoubtedly become the centerpiece of the TypeScript-in-ESLint story going forward; as such, we wanted to make sure that it would be properly maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;announcing-the-typescript-eslint-project&quot;&gt;Announcing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint&lt;/code&gt; project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Henry, who has long been the driving force behind TypeScript compatibility for ESLint, has started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project as a centralized repository for all things related to TypeScript ESLint compatibility. This will be the new home of the TypeScript parser, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eslint-plugin-typescript&lt;/code&gt;, and any other utilities that will make the TypeScript ESLint experience as seamless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ESLint team won’t be formally involved in the new project, we are fully supportive of James’ efforts and will be keeping lines of communication open to ensure the best ESLint experience for TypeScript developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-this-means-going-forward&quot;&gt;What this means going forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ESLint team will no longer be maintaining &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint-parser&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The repository will be archived as of today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be no further releases of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint-parser&lt;/code&gt; on npm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint-parser&lt;/code&gt; should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@typescript-eslint/parser&lt;/code&gt; instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those interested in how TypeScript support is coming along should follow the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint&lt;/code&gt; repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, we are very excited to welcome the TypeScript community into the ESLint community and look forward to seeing how James and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint&lt;/code&gt; team make ESLint the best choice for linting TypeScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
