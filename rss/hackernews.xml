<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Challenging projects every programmer should try&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;small&gt;12/11/2019&lt;/small&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 12/14: This post spurred a lot of discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21790779&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ean6ch/challenging_projects_every_programmer_should_try/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. I collected some of the suggested projects and put them in a list at the end of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talk to a lot of students and professional developers that often want to start a side project, but aren't sure what to build. Below is a handful of software projects that taught me a lot. In fact, they're great because you could build them multiple times and learn new things each time. So whenever I don't know what to build or I want to learn a new programming language or framework, I start with one of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2D game - Space Invaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compiler - Tiny BASIC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spreadsheet &lt;small&gt;(&lt;em&gt;hard!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video game console emulator &lt;small&gt;(&lt;em&gt;hard!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Text Editor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use text editors everyday, but do you know how it really works? Ignoring all of the fancy features that your favorite editor has, how would you implement a textbox that supports a movable text cursor and selecting, inserting, and deleting text? No, you can't use the builtin textbox component from your favorite GUI framework!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge is figuring out how to store the text document in memory. My first thought was to use an array, but that has horrible performance if the user inserts text anywhere other than the end of the document. Luckily, there are some nice data structures to learn to solve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle was learning how a text cursor behaves in popular editors. For example, if I press the up arrow key with the cursor in the middle of the document, where will the cursor move? Same column? Not if that line is shorter. Keep pressing up. The cursor will snap back to the original column once a line is long enough. It turns out that the cursor has a memory for the column and tries to get back to it. It is these details that I never noticed until I tried to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/images/textcursor.gif&quot; class=&quot;center-block&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After implementing the basic editor, I challenge you to implement two more features: undo/redo and word wrapping. Implementing undo/redo in an efficient way was mind blowing to me! I first tried keeping an array of previous states, then tried the Memento pattern, before finally settling on the Command pattern. Word wrapping forces you to separate the &lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt; aspects of a text line from the memory aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data structures for storing the text: array, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)&quot;&gt;rope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer&quot;&gt;gap buffer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table&quot;&gt;piece table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavior and implementation of the text cursor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design patterns for undo/redo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern&quot;&gt;memento&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern&quot;&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstractions to separate the visual and memory aspects of the text.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Design and Implementation of a Win32 Text Editor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catch22.net/tuts/neatpad#&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/36k1kEv&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2D game - Space Invaders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most simple games require some unique data structures and design patterns. The idea here is to implement a well-defined game from start to finish without getting bogged down on the other fun stuff (e.g., game design and art). Also, it is best if you use a barebones 2D graphics library (e.g., SDL, SFML, PyGame), not a big game engine that'll hide all of the interesting bits from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/images/spaceinvaders.png&quot; class=&quot;center-block&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, you'll have to learn to draw to the screen. I had no idea how this worked. You are actually clearing the screen then drawing each portion of the screen in rapid succession, many times a second, to create the effect that objects are moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you'll learn all about the game loop. A game is effectively looping between drawing, getting user input, and processing the game logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, you'll learn how to process user input. I never paid attention to the subtlties of initially pressing, holding, and releasing keys or mouse buttons, let alone handling things like a double click. And how often do you check for user input? If you are constantly checking then that means the rest of the game is frozen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, you'll learn how to create and manage all of your game objects and their state. For example, how do you generate a dynamic number of enemies? The factory pattern helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, you'll learn how to apply the game's logic. When do bullet positions get updated? When do more enemies come onscreen? How do you know when an enemy is destroyed? When is the game over? I had never used the modulo operator prior to making games but it is littered all over my games' code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get the basic game working, add a title screen menu, a game over screen, make sure the game runs at the same speed even on different computers, and explore how to implement more interesting enemies with AI. Still not enough? Add shader effects, sound, and online multiplayer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drawing to the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling user input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating and managing a dynamic number of objects (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)&quot;&gt;factory pattern&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State machines for enemy AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using shaders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking for online features.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Compiler - Tiny BASIC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most-eye opening projects I have worked on are compilers. Even now, if I have a free Sunday afternoon to do some coding, chances are it is a compiler. It is a great feeling when you create something that enables others to create more things. By implementing one I had to learn so much more about the intricacies of compilers that I normally would never think about (e.g., when do expressions get implicitly type converted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest writing the compiler from scratch for a very small BASIC-like language (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC&quot;&gt;Tiny BASIC&lt;/a&gt;) and compile to any other language that you know well. For example, you could write a Tiny BASIC compiler in Python that outputs C# code. It does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have to output assembly or C! Avoiding those will let you focus on the compiler itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/images/peaybasic.png&quot; class=&quot;center-block&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hurdle is figuring out how to lex (or tokenize) the input code. Then you will parse the code, that is check the structure of the input and produce a tree representation of the code. The recursive descent parsing technique is beautiful! Next you will semantically check the input, ensuring the code makes sense and that the type rules are being followed. Finally, you can generate output!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has a ton of existing resources to help you, and a simple compiler can be completed in a few days. Don't let the jargon scare you. Plus the possibilities are endless to what you can add! Once you have the basic compiler working, you can add a standard library (in PeayBASIC I added simple 2D graphics functionality), optimization passes, and improve the error messages. Finally, you should write some example programs in your own language to show off to the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mini Operating System&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have found myself applying fundamental concepts from operating systems to a variety of domains, like games and even predictive models of human behavior. In a classroom setting the algorithms and data structures used by operating systems might seem abstract or useless, but they really are useful. Implementing an operating system also helped me understand far more about what is going on under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/images/marzos.png&quot; class=&quot;center-block&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve and some barriers to get started since it is dependent on hardware. However, by following a book or tutorial then you should be able to get a bootable OS working that can run your own programs. I highly recommend my colleague's free online book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still not difficult enough for you? Try these two projects:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Spreadsheet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spreadsheet application, like Excel, combines some of the challenges from a text editor with those of a compiler. You'll have to learn how to represent the cell contents in memory and implement an interpreter for the programming language used for equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Directed acyclic graph (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph&quot;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Video game console emulator&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing an emulator (or virtual machine) for a video game console combines the challenges of writing a compiler, an operating system, and a compiler all into one. It is quite rewarding to play a real game made by someone else with your emulator!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emulating a real video game console means writing a virtual machine that pretends to function just like the actual CPU and other hardware components. This allows you to run games designed for the video game console with your emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend starting by emulating CHIP-8, which is a simple, fictitious console, before moving on to a real video game console. The NES, SNES, Gameboy, and Gameboy Advance are all quite feasible to emulate, with a far amount of documentation and open source emulators already, though they each have their own quirks to make things interesting (e.g., certain games may rely on undocumented bugs/features of the specific hardware). There is also the PICO-8, which has become a very profitable &quot;fantasy&quot; console.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Having Kids</title>
<link>http://paulgraham.com/kids.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://paulgraham.com/kids.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/aah/paulgraham/having-kids-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;95&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Having Kids&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;December 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children. But did I want them now? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically, because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at all. &quot;Better you than me,&quot; I was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded turned out to be wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was born. It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking &quot;I have to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is someone's child!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is great. To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you that you'll be happy if you join the cult too — but only because joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you happy to be a cult member. But not entirely. There were some things about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed that I wrote &quot;Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids.&quot; Of course the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed them? Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes. Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler is something very few parents enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were all the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about these much — the magic is hard to put into words, and all other parents know about them anyway — but one of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be doing. You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but that's what you feel. You don't need to look any further than where you are right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was essentially law enforcement. I didn't realize there were good times too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids. You don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty times) it's often genuinely fun to play with them. That surprised me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still, terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience that are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for the lifeboats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my worries about having kids were right, though. They definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some people get their act together, but if your act was already together, you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules. I'm not sure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids, you tend to have to work on their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had kids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day, whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be times when you have to stop, even if it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds a way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens at those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had kids, I get enough done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But if there weren't something real there, why would I squirm? The fact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum game. Only one idea at a time can be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/top.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;top idea in your mind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it will less often be some project you're working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when I write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That drives me to get things right. And when I was writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/bel.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I told my kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise. Which meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to Africa. Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net ahead. But the wind is there, no question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it won't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't overwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the ability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice. That was so great. Why did I never do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments, there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it on tap, almost any bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People's experiences as parents vary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I had before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other parents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that kids bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the fascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year olds, 2 year old are just defective 6 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>37-Year-Old Mom Spent Seven Days Online as an 11-Year-Old Girl</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@sloane_ryan/im-a-37-year-old-mom-i-spent-seven-days-online-as-an-11-year-old-girl-here-s-what-i-learned-9825e81c8e7d</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;3710&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;That was nine months ago. Since then, we’ve created an entire team focused on the impromptu meeting Brian and I had in that conference room. We’ve formed continuous working relationships with the kinds of government law enforcement agencies that boast three-letter acronyms. We’ve had test runs, new hires, and countless other meetings. We’ve seen arrests and sentencings. We’ve provided testimony in court and invaluable information to investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a74d&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;My own role changed to heading up this new special projects team. And to preserve the integrity of this project, this special projects team works largely behind-the-scenes and out of the limelight. We don’t appear on the company website, and our Twitter profile photos show inanimate objects instead of our actual faces. Brian and I are also the bridge between the team and law enforcement, with regular meetings and status updates, making sure we’re always working within not only their parameters, but those of the prosecuting attorneys. No one wants our hard work to go to waste because of missing evidence or even a hint of entrapment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;cf71&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;Here, now, in this media room, this isn’t our first rodeo. It’s not even our second or third rodeo. Over the past nine months, I’ve been 15-year-old Libby and 16-year-old Kait and 14-year-old Ava. I’ve been a studious sophomore contemplating bangs and a lacrosse player being raised by her aunt and an excitable junior eager for prom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8f75&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;At this point, we’re seasoned veterans — but this is our first time using a persona this young. Tonight, my chest is tightly bound and my language reads significantly less mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1165&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;Tonight, I am 11-year-old Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c37c&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Here we go,” I say to the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1086&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“You can do it, Sloane,” Reid says to me, patting my shoulder woodenly, but still assuredly. Reid’s chin is stern and she’s staring intently ahead. An attorney with a background in criminal law, Reid moved to the private sector and joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bark.us/?s=mediumpredator&quot; class=&quot;bi cv hz ia ib ic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Bark&lt;/a&gt; when we launched this project. With a knowledge of law and a background in dealing with some gnarly crimes, Reid has been a welcome addition to the team. To an outsider, a shoulder pat might seem stiff, but from Reid, it feels like genuine care and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f870&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;Pete — former military, now private security — who is quite literally three times my size, sits in the front living room. Tonight is certainly low risk, but on the days that have felt significantly scarier, he affords us all a little peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;8a38&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;I upload the photo to Instagram — a generic, innocuous selfie of Bailey with an ear-to-ear smile — and caption it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ec94&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;v excitedd to see my friends this weekend at carly’s party! Ilysm!!&lt;/em&gt; followed by a string of emojis and a #friends hashtag&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9d45&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;The photo publishes on Instagram and we wait quietly for something on the big screen to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;834e&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;This part never takes long. It’s always unnervingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c7c0&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;At the beginning of the week, on the very first night as Bailey, two new messages came in under a minute after publishing a photo. We sat mouths agape as the numbers pinged up on the screen — 2, 3, 7, 15 messages from adult men over the course of two hours. Half of them could be charged with transfer of obscene content to a minor. That night, I had taken a breather and sat with my head in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;584b&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;Nine months of this, and we still continue to be stunned by the breadth of cruelty and perversion we see. I imagine this trend will continue tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;a8f7&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Incoming,” Avery says, and we all look up at the TV. The Instagram notifications show that Bailey has three new requests for conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5fd5&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Hi! I was just wondering how long you’ve been a model for?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;43f0&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“lol! im not a model,” I type quickly, hitting send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;27e0&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“No!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; he types, full of false incredulity. &lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“You’re lying! If not, you should be a model. You’re so PRETTY.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3734&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;@ XXXastrolifer appears to be in his early 40s, but tells Bailey he’s 19. When she tells him she’s only 11, he doesn’t flinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7a23&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;The next message is from another man who greets Bailey harmlessly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7fba&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Hi! How are you doing tonight?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dcc8&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Hi im good hbu”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;829f&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“I’m doing alright, thank you. You are a very beautiful girl.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e2c&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;I hear Josh next to me mutter. “Like clockwork.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3437&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Wow, thank u!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5ffb&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“It’s true. I love your pictures on here. Does your mom and dad let you have a boyfriend yet?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3e8c&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;Bailey says no, but also, it’s not something they talk about a lot. I poll the parents in the room. They agree. Getting a boyfriend isn’t top of mind for an 11-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2c44&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Maybe I can be your Instagram bf if you would like? Up to you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4120&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;I pause to respond to @ XXXastrolifer. The conversation ends like most of them do — in under five minutes, he sends Bailey a video to show himself masturbating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;51f7&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Do you like that? Have you seen one of those before?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;89f4&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;I turn my attention back to @ XXXthisguy66, the would-be Instagram boyfriend. In a matter of minutes, it escalates from &lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“An Instagram boyfriend means we can chat with each other, send selfies back and forth, and just be there for each other”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Since we are together, are you ready to send sexy pics to each other?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4412&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;She’s 11, and doesn’t quite know what he means. He sends a photo of his erect penis, requests a photo of her shirtless, and assures her that he can teach her how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ffa4&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Well, a lot of boyfriends like it when their girlfriend give them a blowjob. Do you know what that means?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5881&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“No I dont.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;2258&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“That means you take the dick in your hand and then you put your mouth over it and you suck on it like you would suck on your thumb.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b509&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“I dont get it,” Bailey types back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;83c6&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“You take my dick. You put it in your mouth, and you suck on it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7270&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“God,” Reid interjects, and I look at her. “A child’s first sex talk shouldn’t be with a man who wants to rape her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d1cb&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;I turn back to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ef1a&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“But why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1515&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Some girls like it, but it feels really good to the boy. That’s just what a boy likes. Now what a boy and a girl really like together is if I put my dick in between your legs and push it inside you. That is called sex. Or fucking.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2bd4&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Oh. I learned about sex”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cb8a&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Whenever you get a chance, send me a picture of you without your shirt on, or send me a picture of in between your legs. I would really like that.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fafd&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Like what kind of picture? In between my legs?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7ce0&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;“You know your vagina? Or some people call it a pussy. I would like to see it. Because that’s where my dick goes. But I would like to see your chest too.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8bea&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“I dont really have boobs yet,” Bailey replies. She doesn’t. She wears a training bra for the ritual and camaraderie of training-bra-wearing, but she doesn’t really need one. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ac1f&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“It’s ok. I’m sure you still look great though. I would still suck on your nipples.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1d8e&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“I’m not good at taking body pics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5fd4&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“It’s ok. Can you send me a picture of you sucking on your finger? That way I can imagine you giving me a blowjob like we talked about earlier. I’ll send you another pic of my dick.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8f18&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;He does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;3571&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;I exit the conversation with @ XXXastrolifer to see another nine requests pending. My phone rings loudly through the TV speakers, startling all of us. It’s an incoming Instagram video call from a new would-be abuser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;523a&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;I make a snap decision to take it, drop my phone, and pull off my sweatshirt to swap it out for one with a hood. The room knows what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4c94&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Keep quiet, everyone,” Nathan states the unnecessary. With my hood up and the room dimly lit, I tilt my head to obscure my face and answer the call. Dominique on my left remains poised at the ready. A former costume designer, her skills with wigs and stage makeup are unmatched. Photos of my personas side-by-side don’t even look like they’re related. I’m Latina. I’m part Asian. I’m a blonde. I’m a redhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;18fa&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;We’re greeted by a man with a British accent, breathing heavily and whispering into the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3001&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“Hey. How are you? I want to see you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; He tilts his phone and he’s lying in bed and shirtless. I kick my voice up an octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6ef6&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“Ummmm. I’m shy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;877e&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;go iu&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;“No, baby, no. Don’t be shy,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; he croons, his voice soft and persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a075&quot; class=&quot;gm gn ar bz go b gp gq gr gs gt gu gv gw gx gy gz&quot;&gt;“I can’t fucking take this,” Will says, and walks out of the room, shaking his head.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Happens After Prisoners Learn to Code?</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/12/from-prison-to-silicon-valley/603406/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/12/from-prison-to-silicon-valley/603406/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Jesse Aguirre’s workday at Slack starts with a standard engineering meeting—programmers call them “standups”—where he and his co-workers plan the day’s agenda. Around the circle stand graduates from Silicon Valley’s top companies and the nation’s top universities. Aguirre, who is 26, did not finish high school and has so far spent most of his adulthood in prison; Slack is his first full-time employer. But in the few years he has been writing code, he has cultivated what is perhaps the most useful skill in any software engineer’s arsenal: the ability to figure things out on his own.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Aguirre, along with Lino Ornelas and Charles Anderson, make up the inaugural cohort of Next Chapter, an initiative launched by Slack, in partnership with the Last Mile, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and Free America, to help formerly incarcerated individuals land jobs in tech. Last year, when Next Chapter launched as an apprenticeship program at Slack—but didn’t guarantee full-time employment—Alexis C. Madrigal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/big-techs-newest-experiment-in-criminal-justice-reform/568849/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in this publication, “Offering an apprenticeship rather than a permanent job may not seem like a huge distinction, but multiple advocates for formerly incarcerated people called attention to this part of the program design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It was a fair point. Silicon Valley has often taken symbolic steps toward making the industry more equitable but has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/five-years-tech-diversity-reports-little-progress/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;under-delivered&lt;/a&gt; on lasting change. In June, however, just days before Slack’s IPO, Aguirre, Ornelas, and Anderson were all offered full-time positions, complete with stock options. For Aguirre and his friends, this raised a new question: Could they make it? Access to an elite organization does not necessarily translate, of course, to success. “It’s true that nothing stops a bullet like a job,” Katherine Katcher, the executive director of Root &amp;amp; Rebound, a California-based reentry program, told me. “But reentry is complicated—a job alone without support is usually not enough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/big-techs-newest-experiment-in-criminal-justice-reform/568849/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Big Tech’s newest experiment in criminal-justice reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For formerly incarcerated individuals, the stakes of finding, and keeping, a job are high. Almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://californiainnocenceproject.org/issues-we-face/recidivism-rates/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; of those released from California’s prison system return within three years. Full-time employment is one of the most effective levers to reduce recidivism, but it isn’t easy to find work when you have spent much of your adult life behind bars. For various reasons, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/are-states-complying-ban-box-laws/601240/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt; against people with a criminal record, the unemployment rate for people who have been incarcerated is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/outofwork.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;more than six times&lt;/a&gt; the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“When I got my job offer, I felt like a guy from college getting drafted to the NBA,” Aguirre told me recently over the phone. “But with my background, I also feel like I have a lot to prove.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Aguirre was first exposed to software development as an inmate at Ironwood State Prison, a rural California prison known for its sweltering summers and progressive rehabilitation programs. For the first month of the Last Mile, a program that teaches business and software skills in prisons, Aguirre and his fellow students didn’t have access to computers. They relied on books and pens to scribble out code on scratch paper. For his first project, Aguirre handwrote code to re-create the In-N-Out Burger website using only a printed-out copy of the chain’s homepage as reference.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Drew McGahey, the engineering manager at Slack for all three apprentices, was initially struck by their ability to solve what he called “blank-canvas problems”—those that don’t have prescribed solutions. “Thinking back to their experience, it makes a lot of sense,” he said. “They all learned how to code in an environment where they didn’t have access to the internet. They’ve got drive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But from the start, it was clear to Aguirre that the stigma of incarceration does not end when a person is released from prison. Some of Slack’s customers restrict their vendors from allowing people with a criminal record to access their data. All three apprentices were placed on the test-automation team, which writes tests to ensure the quality of other engineers’ code, precisely because it’s insulated from customer data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Even before starting at Slack, there was the not-insignificant challenge of relocating to Silicon Valley—which Aguirre, Ornelas, and Anderson all had to do in order to accept their positions. All three had been paroled into other jurisdictions. Not only does transferring one’s parole assignment require a long, bureaucratic process, but simply finding an affordable place to live that accepts people with a criminal record—especially in the Bay Area, with its tight housing market—can be a full-time job in itself. Aguirre said he was pressured to leave the first place he lived by a roommate who grew uncomfortable with the idea of living with someone who had been in prison. After staying with a friend for almost a year, he applied for more than 50 apartments before he was able to find a more permanent home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Finding a job is one thing—we all know the stigma associated with incarceration makes it really difficult to find work—but the same exists for housing,” said Kenyatta Leal, who is formerly incarcerated himself and now works for Slack as the “reentry manager” for the Next Chapter program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/how-slack-got-ahead-in-diversity/558806/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: How Slack got ahead in diversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Leal serves as a player-coach, mentoring Aguirre, Ornelas, and Anderson through issues such as housing, financial literacy, workplace norms, and the multitude of other reentry challenges that he has overcome himself. In addition to working with Leal, Aguirre, Ornelas, and Anderson also each have a technical mentor, a work-culture mentor, and a career coach, and Slack’s nonprofit partners help the apprentices navigate housing, parole, and travel, and educate Slack’s employees on criminal-justice issues. All of this helped Aguirre feel more welcome at the office, despite having come from a different background than those of many of his colleagues.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Aguirre grew up in Lynwood, California, a predominantly Latino community in South Los Angeles. When he was 11, his family moved east to Orange County, and a couple of years later Aguirre became involved with members of a local gang. He was cited by the local police for some minor offenses, like tagging a telephone pole in chalk, but no serious charges resulted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Then, on March 13, 2010, Ramon Magana, a young man with local gang affiliations, was shot with a shotgun carrying bird-shot ammunition. Witnesses at the scene said that Aguirre was not the shooter, but, according to police testimony, he had handed the gun to the person who eventually committed the crime. Aguirre was charged as an adult with attempted murder, assault, and gang affiliation. A few weeks after he turned 18, he was shipped off to prison with a life sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Aguirre’s sentence spurred a public outcry. In 2014, a California Court of Appeal determined that Aguirre had “ineffective” counsel and that his sentencing “raised issues of cruel and unusual punishment.” In a resentencing hearing, his time was reduced to seven years, plus a state-mandated 10-year enhancement for gang-related activity. Then, on Christmas Eve 2017, Aguirre learned that Jerry Brown, then the governor of California, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orangejuiceblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Jesus-Aguirre-Commutation-by-Gov-Brown.jpg&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;had decided&lt;/a&gt; to cancel the 10-year enhancement, citing Aguirre’s exemplary behavior and work ethic in prison. By that time, Aguirre had gotten his GED, completed the coding boot camp, and served nearly eight years behind bars. He was up for immediate release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/12/The_Atlantic_spot_illustration_finals_1/c81fb95f4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Fien Jorissen
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The prior year, Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield and a group of co-workers had visited a Last Mile program at San Quentin State Prison, just north of San Francisco. Butterfield was particularly impressed by the program’s rigor and the quality of the software the inmates were producing. Around the time Aguirre was released, Slack started laying the groundwork for what would eventually become Next Chapter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The goal of Slack for Good, the company’s philanthropic arm, is to increase the number of underrepresented individuals in tech. “Two of our key values as a company are being inclusive and having empathy,” said Deepti Rohatgi, the head of Slack for Good. “This program was not only a way to move the needle on an incredibly important issue in the United States, but also to make it very clear to our employees that these values matter to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Of the 10 people who underwent the rigorous interview process for Next Chapter—a process similar to how Slack interviews any entry-level software engineer—Aguirre was one of the three chosen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“If you want to understand a societal issue, you have to get close to it,” said Leal, who, as an inmate at San Quentin, also went through the Last Mile program. While on the inside, Leal met Duncan Logan, the CEO of a tech accelerator called Rocketspace. After Leal was released, he went on to work for Logan for five years. “It’s a huge paradigm shift—going from living in a 6-by-9-foot cell and having very little decision-making power in your life to all of a sudden being part of the 21st-century gold rush,” Leal said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now, Leal not only helps the apprentices acculturate but also, perhaps more importantly, helps the rest of the company learn about what it means to be formerly incarcerated in the United States. With more than 600,000 people returning to society each year, a company hiring three formerly incarcerated software engineers doesn’t do much to address the scale of the reentry challenge. “Programs like the one at Slack help returning citizens feel their worth and dignity,” said Katcher. “But I want to caution the movement to get tech to propose solutions to all of society’s issues. We need to applaud companies like Slack, but know that the nitty-gritty of human services—housing, health care, social support—which lots of nonprofits and public institutions are working on, the private sector has largely turned away from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A spokeswoman for Slack said the company recognizes that this one project won’t solve broader reentry challenges, but she noted that the company hopes, internally and through its nonprofit partnerships, to help address issues faced by its formerly incarcerated hires.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Aside from affecting the lives of Aguirre, Ornelas, and Anderson, the largest change as a result of Next Chapter may be a shift in perspective—among Slack’s employees and, with luck, the tech industry as a whole. Slack &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/how-slack-got-ahead-in-diversity/558806/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;has already been outperforming&lt;/a&gt; some of its Silicon Valley peers when it comes to hiring diverse talent. Creating a blueprint to hire formerly incarcerated engineers—and, more broadly, changing how employees think about those who have been imprisoned—may catalyze a larger shift in public opinion. Slack has held multiple company-wide meetings on criminal justice, including “reentry simulators” in which employees act out the challenges people face when leaving prison, such as applying for housing or registering with the Department of Motor Vehicles. In the past few years, more than 200 employees have visited San Quentin to mentor and learn from aspiring tech workers on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“When we first came into Slack, there was fear,” Leal acknowledged. Some employees were hesitant to work alongside formerly incarcerated co-workers; others thought the program might distract from more important priorities. But through talking to Slack employees, he said, he was able to help change their attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Six months into his full-time job at Slack, Aguirre’s life is peaceful. At work, he’s become one of the more senior members of his team, so new hires come to him for advice. He runs a coding group on Fridays to help other engineers at the company understand how the test-automation process works. Most days, he has lunch with Ornelas and Anderson. “I appreciate the small stuff now—being able to get dropped off anywhere, ordering Uber Eats on my phone, hearing my mom on the phone whenever I want,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Today, Aguirre’s focus is on becoming a better software developer. He wants to transition into a front-end role that would allow him to work more directly with the Slack features that users see. (Building certain features of the app doesn’t require engineers to access customer data.) Recently, in a glass conference room on the top floor of Slack’s San Francisco headquarters, I asked him about his professional ambitions. “I don’t like to think too far ahead because stuff always changes,” he said. “But five years from now, I hope that I have a good track record as an engineer, and that my story has helped a lot of people change their perception of people with my background.” Some of Aguirre’s friends back in Orange County don’t know quite what a software engineer does, but they do know tech. Aguirre tries to encourage them to get into coding, offering to send them books to get started. “I tell them this isn’t like working at an old traditional company,” he said. “This is the new stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Enough with the Dead Butterflies (2017)</title>

&lt;li class=&quot;meta-categories&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Categories&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have pet peeves, even though there’s a lot going on in the world that makes them pretty insignificant. While acknowledging that there are many more important things in life, I write this post about my own personal illustration pet peeve in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, it’ll make a little teeny difference. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love butterflies. They’re one of my favorite subjects to illustrate and one of my favorite sights in nature. To me, they’re a symbol of hope, an embodiment of beauty, and a sign of what’s right in the world. I think that’s why it bothers me when depictions of butterflies often fail to do them justice, whether they are in a work of art, a website, a product, an animation, or in print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My explanation needs to begin with a description of a dead butterfly. When a butterfly is placed in an insect collection, the person who prepares it positions its wings according to a convention that facilitates identification. In the photo of a dead, pinned butterfly below, note that the trailing edge of the forewings (blue line) is perpendicular to the body’s axis (red line). When the insect has just been killed, it remains flexible for awhile, allowing the collector time to insert a pin and manipulate its wings into this position, where they are held in place until they become dry and stiff. This is an unnatural position for the wings; it’s a pose that may be possible for the insect to assume in life, but not a position that most species typically assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2798&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-2798&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2798 size-medium_large&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly-768x594.jpg?resize=768%2C594&quot; alt=&quot;pinned Viceroy&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;594&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=768%2C594&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=150%2C116&amp;amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=500%2C387&amp;amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=745%2C577&amp;amp;ssl=1 745w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=305%2C236&amp;amp;ssl=1 305w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=570%2C441&amp;amp;ssl=1 570w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?resize=395%2C306&amp;amp;ssl=1 395w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Damstra-pinned_butterfly.jpg?w=1000&amp;amp;ssl=1 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-2798&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Photo of pinned Viceroy © Emily S. Damstra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In field guides and other butterfly reference materials, one frequently sees images of such pinned butterflies because, I presume, it is easy to photograph a dead butterfly. Also, numerous photos of dead butterflies against the same background is aesthetically consistent, and the pinned position allows the viewer to see as much of the hind wings as possible, aiding identification. It is a useful convention and it makes sense in field guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, butterflies that are alive and going about their business of flying and nectaring do not typically hold their forewings too far forward of their head. In life, the way a butterfly holds its wings is variable, but it is uncommon for most species that I’ve encountered to hold their forewings in the manner of pinned specimen. Here are some photographs I’ve taken over the years that demonstrate this:&lt;/p&gt;

Damstra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, in most cases, it is the &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; edge of the forewings that is nearly perpendicular to the body. One will notice quite a bit of variability in wing positions in living butterflies, but it’s atypical for the trailing edge of the forewings to be perpendicular to the body. This is true not only of butterflies that are perched, but also of butterflies aloft. As an example, view this&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gettyimages.ca/license/138307199&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; photo of monarchs in flight&lt;/a&gt;. There are exceptions, of course. It seems that some of the smaller butterflies may exhibit wing positions fairly close to that of a dead, pinned specimen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the field guide photos of dead, pinned butterflies are the ultimate (though unwitting) source of my pet peeve: The pervasive phenomenon of butterflies in popular culture being shown as dead, with the trailing edge of their forewings perpendicular to their body. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/eoskins/9975461605&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt; that the practice of illustrating dead butterflies goes back a long way, in a painting by a 19th century artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly ironic example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Flight-of-butterflies-film-poster.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this movie poster&lt;/a&gt; for a documentary about the flight of monarchs. Some of the flying monarch illustrations are accurate, but the largest and many of the others are clearly dead, even though they’re depicted as if in flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock photography sites include misleading photos of dead butterflies purporting to be in flight. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.istockphoto.com/ca/photo/monarch-butterflies-in-various-flying-positions-isolated-on-white-gm185302115-19288861?st=_p_monarch%20butterfly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photo-monarch-butterfly-flying-beautiful-isolated-white-background-image46588423&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt;. It’s understandable that customers would accept the description as accurate, even though it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.askideas.com/50-amazing-3d-butterfly-tattoos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; shows numerous butterfly tattoos. Only a few look alive, despite the tattoo artists’ clever technique of inking cast shadows to give the impression that the butterflies are actually perched on the skin. Had the recipients of dead butterfly tattoos known the difference between a living and a dead butterfly, I have to believe they would have more carefully considered their options. I think a depiction of a living butterfly is the most effective way to convey its positive symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead butterflies are frequently spotted in gift shops. You can rest your head against them, adorn your ears with them, hang them on your wall, enoy them while you sip a beverage, wrap your gifts with them, or wear them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have blurred a couple company names in the photos above because I’m not trying to shame anyone. Most people have seen and are influenced by thousands (millions?) of depictions of unintentionally dead butterflies and have never considered the difference between a living and a dead butterfly. That’s why I decided to write this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not innocent of committing my own pet peeve. In 2001, I illustrated the endangered Karner Blue butterfly using pinned specimens as a reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2097&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-2097&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-2097&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Karner-Blue-butterfly-Damstra.jpg?resize=400%2C756&quot; alt=&quot;Karner blue butterfly illustration Lycaeides melissa samuelis&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;756&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Karner-Blue-butterfly-Damstra.jpg?w=400&amp;amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Karner-Blue-butterfly-Damstra.jpg?resize=79%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1 79w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Karner-Blue-butterfly-Damstra.jpg?resize=159%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1 159w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Karner-Blue-butterfly-Damstra.jpg?resize=305%2C576&amp;amp;ssl=1 305w, https://i0.wp.com/emilydamstra.com/wp-content/uploads/Karner-Blue-butterfly-Damstra.jpg?resize=395%2C747&amp;amp;ssl=1 395w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-2097&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Karner blue butterfly illustration © Emily S. Damstra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had I realized then what I know now, I would have changed the wing and leg positions to be more lifelike. It would have made for a better representation, even though I was not attempting to show the insects in flight or perched on a flower. Nowadays, if you ask me to illustrate a butterfly, I will position its wings as if it is alive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize there are some instances where it isn’t clear that the artist/designer intended to show a living butterfly, and where it may be perfectly acceptable to represent a dead butterfly. Nonetheless, there’s no good reason to depict a dead butterfly in the vast majority of situations. It doesn’t take much effort to be accurate about wing position. My hope is that the multitudes of butterfly images in our culture will gradually shift toward alive, which is how I prefer to think of them, and how I think these beautiful insects should be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Fabian,

&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; is there any documentation on how the CodeWeavers solution for 32bit
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; Applications on Catalina works?
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; I'm interested in the technical details of this miracle, but there don't seem
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; to be many details out there. What I found was either on the superficial
&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;em&gt; level, or a bunch of speculation.
&lt;/em&gt;
Our solution involves a custom version of the Clang compiler as well as modifications to Wine.  It also relies on a new feature of macOS Catalina to allow the creation of 32-bit code segments in a 64-bit process.  Our modified versions of Wine and Clang/LLVM are included in our source tarball at &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeweavers.com/products/more-information/source&quot;&gt;https://www.codeweavers.com/products/more-information/source&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;.  We hope to have a more convenient approach to sharing and collaborating on this in the future.

The custom compiler has a number of features that support building 32-on-64-bit Wine.  These features are enabled when you compile with the &quot;-mwine32&quot; architecture option (as opposed to -m32 or -m64).  &quot;-mwine32&quot; is a variant of -m64 with additional functionality:

* It knows about both 32- and 64-bit pointers.

* It knows about 32-bit Microsoft calling conventions (cdecl32, stdcall32, thiscall32, fastcall32).

* It will automatically generate 32-to-64-bit thunks for functions with such 32-bit calling conventions.

* A function pointer whose pointee type has a 32-bit calling convention is assumed to point to 32-bit code.  When calling through such a pointer, the compiler automatically generates the appropriate 64-to-32-bit thunk.  Taking the address of a function with a 32-bit calling convention will yield a pointer to the 32-to-64-bit thunk the compiler generated.  As an optimization, the compiler-generated 32-to-64-bit thunks have a recognizable signature and the call-site code can check that to skip the 64-to-32-to-64-bit thunking that would otherwise occur.

* It has a notion of &quot;local&quot; include paths and thus local (Wine) headers vs. external/system headers.  It uses this to apply certain defaults to types from external/system headers.

* It defines the macro __i386_on_x86_64__.


Now for some of the nitty-gritty details:

The compiler has a concept of &quot;address spaces&quot;, the normal 64-bit one (called, somewhat confusingly, &quot;default&quot; and a 32-bit one (called &quot;ptr32&quot;).  It maintains a current implicit stack address space, a current implicit storage address space, and a current implicit pointer address space.

The implicit stack address space tells the compiler where a stack variable lives.  The type of the address-of operator applied to a stack variable is a pointer of the appropriate size.  If the variable is in the 32-bit address space, then the resulting pointer is 32 bits in size.  If it's in the 64-bit address space, the address is a 64-bit pointer.  The same thing happens when an array on the stack decays to a pointer.

By default, when compiling with -mwine32, the implicit stack address space is the 32-bit address space.  There's a command-line option, -mstack64, to override that.

The compiler does not control where the stack actually is at runtime.  So, it's Wine's responsibility to make sure that threads which run code compiled with the 32-bit stack address space actually have their stack in the low 4GB of the process's virtual memory.


The implicit storage address space tells the compiler where static data and code live.  So, if you take the address of a static variable or a function, you get a pointer type of the appropriate size.  Similarly for string literals.

By default, when compiling with -mwine32, the implicit storage address space is the 32-bit address space.  That can be overridden with the command-line option -mstorage-address-space={default | ptr32}.  Furthermore, it can be altered in code using:

#pragma clang storage_addr_space({default | ptr32})
#pragma clang storage_addr_space(push, {default | ptr32})
#pragma clang storage_addr_space(pop)

When an external/system header is #include'd, it's as though the content were surrounded by

#pragma clang storage_addr_space(push, default)
…
#pragma clang storage_addr_space(pop)

So, all of the declarations and definitions in such headers are in the default (64-bit) address space.

Again, the compiler does not actually control where in the process's virtual memory a module gets loaded.  It's Wine's responsibility to ensure that modules with code compiled with the 32-bit storage address space is actually loaded in the low 4GB.


The implicit pointer address space governs the size of declared pointers.

When a typedef, struct, or union is defined, the pointer address space that's current at the time is remembered.  Later, if a pointer to such a type is declared, the pointer is in that remembered address space.  So, for example, a Win32 type such as CREATESTRUCTW will be defined in the ptr32 pointer address space, therefore &quot;CREATESTRUCTW *cs&quot; will be a 32-bit pointer.  A system type such as struct stat will be defined in the default (64-bit) pointer address space, so &quot;struct stat *st&quot; will be a 64-bit pointer.

A pointer type can be decorated with the __ptr32 or __ptr64 keyword to explicitly declare its size, overriding the logic above.  For example, &quot;CREATESTRUCTW * __ptr64 cs&quot; will be a 64-bit pointer.

If neither of the above apply, the pointer's size is dictated by the current implicit pointer address space.  So, for &quot;int *foo&quot;, foo is a 32-bit pointer if the implicit pointer address space is ptr32, or a 64-bit pointer if it's default.

The implicit pointer address space is &quot;default&quot; (64-bit), by default.  This can be overridden with the command-line option &quot;-mdefault-address-space={default | ptr32}&quot;.  Furthermore, it can be altered in code using:

#pragma clang default_addr_space({default | ptr32})
#pragma clang default_addr_space(push, {default | ptr32})
#pragma clang default_addr_space(pop)

And, again, external/system headers are processed as though their content were surrounded by:

#pragma clang default_addr_space(push, default)
…
#pragma clang default_addr_space(pop)


A big potential source of problems with 32- and 64-bit pointers is accidental truncation by assigning a 64-bit pointer to a 32-bit pointer.  So, such assignment is prohibited.  Even a normal cast is not enough to allow it.  Only a special cast syntax can enable shortening a pointer: foo = (__addrspace Type)bar.

Another potential source of problems is when casting a pointer type to a smaller integer type or casting an integer type to a smaller pointer type.  There's a new set of warnings for that (which 32-on-64-bit Wine promotes to errors).  There's another special cast syntax to suppress the warning for a specific conversion: foo = (__truncate Type)bar.


The 32-bit calling conventions can be applied to a function type using __attribute__(({cdecl32 | stdcall32 | thiscall32 | fastcall32})).  These calling conventions are slightly tweaked for 64-bit code.  None of them are callee-pop; they assume the caller will clean up the arguments pushed to the stack.  Since 32-bit callers of stdcall32, thiscall32, or fastcall32 functions will have assumed the callee cleans up, that job falls to the 32-to-64-bit thunks the compiler generates.  Also, the generated 64-bit code expects 12 extra bytes on the stack between the return address and the stack arguments.  (This makes the thunks simpler and more efficient.)

The name of the 32-to-64-bit thunk generated for such a function is &amp;lt;prefix&amp;gt;_thunk_&amp;lt;function name&amp;gt;.  The prefix defaults to &quot;__i386_on_x86_64&quot; but that can be overridden with the command-line option &quot;-minterop64-32-thunk-prefix=&amp;lt;whatever&amp;gt;&quot;.  Wine sets that to &quot;wine&quot;, so the thunk name is wine_thunk_&amp;lt;function_name&amp;gt;.

If the code already supplies a definition of a symbol with that name, the compiler treats that as a custom thunk (or alternative 32-bit implementation) and doesn't auto-generate a thunk of its own.

The generated thunks (both 32-to-64-bit and 64-to-32-bit) need to know the code segment selector to use.  The compiler assumes two unsigned short variables are defined whose values are those selectors.  By default, the variable names are __i386_on_x86_64_cs32 and __i386_on_x86_64_cs64, but those can be overridden with &quot;-minterop64-32-cs32-name=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&quot; and &quot;-minterop64-32-cs64-name=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&quot;.  Wine uses &quot;wine_32on64_cs32&quot; and &quot;wine_32on64_cs64&quot;.  Those variables are defined and initialized in libwine.


Speaking of code segments, the big thing that Catalina provides that enables this all to work is the ability to create 32-bit code segments in a 64-bit process.  For that, they enabled the use of i386_set_ldt() in 64-bit processes.  The big caveat though, is that this functionality is restricted by System Integrity Protection (SIP).  For now, your best bet to get this working for yourself is to disable SIP.  (CrossOver doesn't require that, but the mechanism by which we accomplish that is in flux internally to Apple.  When it settles down, I'll update this thread.)


All of that in place, the rest of the work was modifying Wine to use this compiler and OS functionality.  That largely consisted of fixing the compilation errors resulting from the interfacing of system libraries (using 64-bit pointers) and Win32 APIs (using 32-bit pointers).  Also, everywhere there was an architecture dependency had to be reviewed and possibly altered.  That, of course, includes all assembly language code.


As long as this email is, I'm sure I've forgotten or glossed over some stuff.  Feel free to ask questions.

Cheers,
Ken

<title>Tony Brooker, creator of Mark 1 Autocode, has died</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/technology/tony-brooker-dead.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tony Brooker, the mathematician and computer scientist who designed the programming language for the world’s first commercial computer, died on Nov. 20 at a nursing home in Hexham, England. He was 94.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His death was confirmed by his son Stephen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Brooker had been immersed in early computer research at the University of Cambridge when one day, on his way home from a mountain-climbing trip in North Wales, he stopped at the University of Manchester to tour its computer lab, which was among the first of its kind. Dropping in unannounced, he introduced himself to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/obituaries/alan-turing-overlooked.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alan Turing&lt;/a&gt;, a founding father of the computer age, who at the time was the lab’s deputy director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Mr. Brooker described his own research at the University of Cambridge, he later recalled, Mr. Turing said, “Well, we can always employ someone like you.” Soon they were colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Brooker joined the Manchester lab in October 1951, just after it installed a new machine called the Ferranti Mark 1. His job, he told the British Library &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bl.uk/voices-of-science/interviewees/tony-brooker/audio/tony-brooker-autocode&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in an interview in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, was to make the Mark 1 “usable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Turing had written a user’s manual, but it was far from intuitive. To program the machine, engineers had to write in binary code — patterns made up of 0s and 1s — and they had to write them backward, from right to left, because this was the way the hardware read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was “extremely neat and very clever but pretty meaningless and very unfriendly,” Mr. Brooker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the months that followed, Mr. Brooker wrote a language he called Autocode, based on ordinary numbers and letters. It allowed anyone to program the machine — not just the limited group of trained engineers who understood the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This marked the beginning of what were later called “high-level” programming languages — languages that provide increasingly simple and intuitive ways of giving commands to computers, from the IBM mainframes of the 1960s to the PCs of the 1980s to the iPhones of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Tony Brooker stared at a bunch of metal and some wires and gave people a way of getting this to actually do something for them,” Tim Bergin, a professor emeritus at American University who specializes in the history of programming languages, said in a phone interview. “He realized that we don’t have to write code in 0s and 1s. We can use symbols and create whole languages for using computers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As the decades passed, this idea helped expand what computers were capable of. Without high-level languages there would be no App Store, and no World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ralph Anthony Brooker was born on Sept, 22, 1925, in southwest London, the youngest son of Edwin Brooker, a civil servant, and Dorothy (Owen) Brooker, a homemaker. His grandfather Harry Brooker was a painter whose work was once exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the beginning of World War II, Tony was evacuated to Petersfield, a town halfway between London and the southern coast, but he returned to London just as the air raids began. (His grandfather died in a raid in 1940.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1943 he won a scholarship to study mathematics at Imperial College London. His studies were accelerated because of the war, and he finished his degree in two years. He also served as a “firewatcher,” spending his nights on the roof of the university’s administration building spotting fires sparked by air raids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the war, he began working at the college and switched his focus to chemistry research. But he soon returned to the mathematics department, where he and two colleagues started experimenting with early computer technology and built a machine they called the Imperial College Computing Engine — “Icky” for short. In 1949 he moved to the University of Cambridge, where he first explored ways of making computers less difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It was a universal problem,” he said. “The early computers were hamstrung.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1954, three years after moving to Manchester, the lab publicly released his Autocode language. It is believed to be the first commercially available high-level language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Six years later, while working on a new machine called Atlas, Mr. Brooker realized another concept that would become seminal in the long history of computer programming. He built a “compiler-compiler” — a programming language for building other programming languages. Before this, engineers and mathematicians could not build a new language without feeding 1s and 0s into the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In the mid-1960s, Mr. Brooker helped design Britain’s first computer science degree program, at the University of Manchester. In 1967, he built a similar degree program as the founding chairman of computer science at the University of Essex, where he worked until he retired in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In addition to his son Stephen, Mr. Brooker is survived by two other sons, Timothy and Richard, and seven grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After Mr. Brooker designed Autocode, Ferranti, the company behind the Mark 1, started a team that wrote test programs using the new language. One programmer was Vera Hewison, whom he married in 1957. (She died in 2018.) Another was Mary Lee Woods, whose son, Tim Berners-Lee, would go on to invent the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The Next Nuclear Plants Will Be Smaller and Safer</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/the-next-nuclear-plants-will-be-small-svelte-and-safer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/the-next-nuclear-plants-will-be-small-svelte-and-safer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For the last 20 years, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/next-gen-nuclear/&quot;&gt;future of nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; has stood in a high bay laboratory tucked away on the Oregon State University campus in the western part of the state. Operated by NuScale Power, an Oregon-based energy startup, this prototype reactor represents a new chapter in the conflict-ridden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/andrew-yang-wants-a-thorium-reactor-by-2027-good-luck-buddy/&quot;&gt;politically bedeviled saga of nuclear power plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NuScale’s reactor won’t need massive cooling towers or sprawling emergency zones. It can be built in a factory and shipped to any location, no matter how remote. Extensive simulations suggest it can handle almost any emergency without a meltdown. One reason is that it barely uses any nuclear fuel, at least compared with existing reactors. It’s also a fraction of the size of its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news for a planet in the grips of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-climate-crisis-is-killing-us/&quot;&gt;climate crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Nuclear energy gets a bad rap in some environmentalist circles, but many energy experts and policymakers agree that splitting atoms is going to be an indispensable part of decarbonizing the world’s electricity. In the US, nuclear power accounts for about two-thirds of all clean electricity, but the existing reactors are rapidly approaching the end of their regulatory lifetimes. Only two new reactors are under construction in the US, but they’re billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Enter the small modular reactor, designed to allow several reactors to be combined into one unit. Need a modest amount of energy? Install just a few modules. Want to fuel a sprawling city? Tack on several more. Coming up with a suitable power plant for a wide range of situations becomes that much easier. Because they are small, these reactors can be mass-produced and shipped to any location in a handful of pieces. Perhaps most importantly, small modular reactors can take advantage of several cooling and safety mechanisms unavailable to their big brothers, which all but guarantees they won’t become the next Chernobyl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NuScale uses a light water reactor—by far the most common type of reactor in commercial nuclear power plants—but that’s about where the similarities end. NuScale’s reactor is 65 feet tall and 9 feet in diameter, and is housed in a containment vessel only slightly larger. About the size of two school buses stacked end to end, you could fit around 100 of them in the containment chamber of a large conventional reactor. Yet this small reactor can crank out 60 megawatts of energy, which is about one-tenth the smallest operational reactor in the US today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going small has big benefits, says Jose Reyes, NuScale’s cofounder and chief technical officer. They’re safer, in part because they are small enough to sit in underground pools of water. If a reactor leaks, the heat can slowly diffuse into the pool. That also means the reactors could be built closer to the places where their power is needed, without the 10-mile safety buffer a conventional plant must have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been reviewing NuScale’s design since 2016; if the commission gives its blessing, the company can finally start building the first commercial reactor of its kind. The review process is brutal—NuScale submitted a 12,000 page technical application—and will likely stretch on for at least another year. But the company has already secured permission to build its first 12-reactor plant at the Idaho National Laboratory, which may start supplying power to communities in Western states as soon as 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small modular reactors may be the first tiny nuclear plants to make it on the US grid, but they won’t be the last. The Department of Energy is also interested in microreactors, a “&lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/what-nuclear-microreactor&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/what-nuclear-microreactor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plug and play&lt;/a&gt;” nuclear plant that usually generates less than 50 megawatts of power. Whereas small modular reactors are better suited to industrial processes and other large power loads, microreactors are ideal for smaller needs like powering a remote military base or keeping the lights on in an isolated Alaskan community. But in the future they could also serve as an “always on” source of carbon-free energy in cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Hello everyone,
&lt;p&gt;I created product on the side as a side project in my own time and it has become a huge hit in the community to a point where my employers wants me to transfer the code-base over. The company does OSS and my side-project is also Open-Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've developed it on my own time but the product directly relates to what my employer does so I've sort of cornered myself in a bad place. In hindsight, I also made some mistakes in how I went about evangelizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I want to keep the ownership with myself but I doubt that is going to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what I want is: - to be compensated in some form for all the time I've put in over the last two years - to have control over the product roadmap (this I'm fairly confident won't happen in the way I want in the long run)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are my options here? What should I ask for here? I don't have much clue as to what can I ask for here so any suggestions would be helpful. People at my company generally wants to work things out to keep everyone happy to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

<title>Shopping Sucks Now</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9399mp/im-fed-up-with-shopping-it-blows-so-hard-why-cant-i-buy-anything-someone-help-me</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9399mp/im-fed-up-with-shopping-it-blows-so-hard-why-cant-i-buy-anything-someone-help-me</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If I look up “gloves” on Amazon with the goal of buying gloves, the site returns over 100,000 listings. Even Amazon cannot bring itself to communicate the exact, unconscionable number of the kinds of gloves it has for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I look in my heart, what I’d really like is a lined leather glove, because I aspire to be classy and refined, like a lady about town. Looking up “lined leather gloves” yields 40,000 results. On the first page, there are two different gloves listed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073P8C7LK?pf_rd_p=183f5289-9dc0-416f-942e-e8f213ef368b&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=7JJWDD4R5NAPVT3W9JKM&amp;amp;th=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one for $17&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013L2NW5S/ref=twister_B002KBFMJG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one for $60&lt;/a&gt;, that look exactly identical and come in the exact same colors. Both have the same exact star rating (4.5/5) and hundreds of positive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to only spend $17 except there is no way 17-dollar leather gloves won’t be fake and off color and smell of gasoline when they arrive, and after only a few wears the lining will pill or develop holes. I’d love to just buy the $60 gloves except that seems like a pretty large amount of money to spend on non-weatherproof gloves, and how can I, when there are identical $17 gloves right there. I could buy both, except then I’d have to return one, which would involve repacking them in a box, locating a printer where I can print off a shipping label, going to a physical UPS store or, worse, a post office, and waiting in line to deliver myself of these gloves I just had to see for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many more hours of online research, I decide it’s impractical to own only a lined leather glove living in the Northeast, so after conducting some research, I decide to invest in some real outdoor gloves. I go to any number of shopping digest sites, which tell me one or a few of the best things of a particular category to buy, in this case, gloves. But The Strategist’s list of, I don’t know, 21 Best Gloves Loved by Northeastern Moms, has endorsements like “these are great for playing with my kids in the snow,” which does not help me at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After yet more hours of research, I finally isolate the perfect pair for me. I don’t want to buy them and have to online-return them—and they are sold out online anyway, due to having been recommended by most of the online shopping digest sites on Earth—so I find out they are sold in-store at a particular big box store in the city, supposedly in my size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrive at the store and locate the glove section and the type of glove I’m looking for, only to find several completely empty racks, except for one pair in size XXXXL, and in a children’s version, with one glove inexplicably missing. Having again reached my tolerance for feeling like an ineffectual idiot unable to buy a simple pair of gloves, I give up and walk home gloveless, my hands freezing in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, our problem was there were not enough things to choose from. Then with big box stores, followed by the internet, there were too many things to choose from. Now there are still too many things to choose from, but also a seemingly infinite number of ways to choose, or seemingly infinite steps to figuring out how to choose. The longer I spend trying to choose, the higher the premium becomes on choosing correctly, which means I &lt;a href=&quot;https://flipboard.com/article/i-m-upset-i-have-wasted-years-of-my-life-reading-product-reviews/a-loQsJsnERYa8a8oHezjp_A%3Aa%3A220507260-babb322d01%2Ftheoutline.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;go on not choosing something I need pretty badly&lt;/a&gt;, coping with the lack of it or an awful hacked-together solution (in the case of gloves, it’s “trying to pull my sleeves over my hands but they are too short for this”) for way, way too long, and sometimes forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree to which you feel this problem definitely depends on your income, or at least, being in the privileged position of not having to make do with the only thing you can afford. But for people with even a limited ability to make an investment purchase, if it’s worth it, there’s even more pressure to get it right. Knowing you wasted a big chunk of money on a cheaper, worse thing that falls apart when you could have spent a little more money on a thing that is good and lasts feels like failure. You’ve then wasted your money, wasted your time, you’ve contributed to global warming, and now you have to start the entire thing over again and hope you don’t somehow end up making the exact same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to choose used to be part of my job when I was an editor at &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wirecutter&lt;/a&gt;, a site that publishes guides to the best products of a given category (vacuums, computers, even &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-touchscreen-gloves/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt;). We had to figure out what was important about any given object, then how important those important things were to the imagined person who needed help choosing this kind of object. Wirecutter has caught a lot of guff recently, for its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/11/guide-to-gift-guides/602710/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;referral link model&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href=&quot;https://onezero.medium.com/the-problem-with-relying-on-wirecutter-reviews-f024574fc7c2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not being able to pick single objects that work for absolutely everyone&lt;/a&gt; (ironically, this criticism comes from outlets that each exist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/emerson-collective-atlantic-coalition/535215/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but for the grace&lt;/a&gt; of extremely wealthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNTmDzhXkz5sfoajlDGCm_iZYKQeoA%3A1576251809920&amp;amp;ei=obHzXYfON4ju_Qbw6obACA&amp;amp;q=ev+williams+net+worth&amp;amp;oq=ev+williams+net+worth&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i70i251.1549.2391..2465...0.0..0.116.901.7j3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0j0i22i30j38.MKtf2ydzOgI&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHotPJ-7LmAhUId98KHXC1AYgQ4dUDCAs&amp;amp;uact=5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley benefactors&lt;/a&gt;). But even Wirecutter, as much as I love and use it, often manifests imperfectly: people frequently complain the chosen models are too expensive, especially since the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; took ownership, and often the items are chosen to appease enthusiasts, not normals. The best gloves for someone who needs to plow snow every day are not the same, at least in the world we live in now, as the best gloves for someone who just needs to be able to walk to work every day. The ideal guide-writing process is figuring out who needs the most help with investing in a particular object, which is not the same person who needs to use it once a year. That leaves many people bereft, forced to execute their own Wirecutter winnowing process, if they simply have the time and patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If big box stores represented the problem of the “tyranny of choice,” the problem is that now, somewhat suddenly, perfect knowledge of the perfect glove, &lt;em&gt;for you specifically&lt;/em&gt;, exists, if you simply do enough research. Now instead of tyranny of choice, we have the tyranny of perfect information. And this is actually a two-part problem: It takes x-approaches-infinity amount of time to achieve this level of knowledge; theoretically, as much as you ever wanted to know about gloves, the internet, (and by extension anyone who might ever offer you yet more info on what makes a good glove) can teach you. Then this all has to be refracted through what makes the perfect glove for you, and how much of that is the same as the platonic ideal of a glove. How waterproof? How warm? How thick? How dexterous? Should it be touch screen compatible? Should it be leather, nylon, wool, nylon lined with wool, leather lined with fleece, Goretex lined with cashmere? Are all of these things stupid and it should just be a polyester job you throw out and buy a new one of next year? But isn’t that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/19/17800654/clothes-plastic-pollution-polyester-washing-machine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terrible for the environment&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, if you did, somehow, against all odds, achieve perfect knowledge of the best glove, you’d find that it probably doesn’t exist, or it exists but almost certainly costs more money than you would want to spend. And then you are faced with the choice of, do you spend $90 on an optimal glove? Or do you spend less than that on a less-optimal glove, knowing at some point in the future you will realize its shortcomings and wish you had just spent the $20 or $40 or $70 extra to get the glove that would have at least worked better than this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm realizing what I actually want is not the perfect glove; what I want is for the world to be small again. This infinite-market stuff was all well and good when being able to buy almost anything was an opportunity, but now that I can consider everything in the interest of saving time and money on buying subpar stuff, it’s an obligation I can’t ignore. But then I inevitably end up wasting a lot of time and money trying to save that time and money, making everything about this my fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I don’t write this article and get immediately accosted by some Instagram drop-ship company pushing a Single Perfect Glove ad campaign, it will happen next winter. They will either be shockingly under- or overpriced, and either way they'll be of shitty quality, but millions of my peers will buy them because they, too, just want the glove problem to be over, and it will be, until the glove falls apart and we all learn it is not, in fact, the one perfect glove, but just a glove like most of the other gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
