<title>ArchiveBox: Open-source self-hosted web archive</title>
<link>https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArchiveBox takes a list of website URLs you want to archive, and creates a local, static, browsable HTML clone of the content from those websites (it saves HTML, JS, media files, PDFs, images and more).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use it to preserve access to websites you care about by storing them locally offline. ArchiveBox works by rendering the pages in a headless browser, then saving all the requests and fully loaded pages in multiple redundant common formats (HTML, PDF, PNG, WARC) that will last long after the original content dissapears off the internet. It also automatically extracts assets like git repositories, audio, video, subtitles, images, and PDFs into separate files using &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pywb&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArchiveBox doesn't require a constantly running server or backend, instead you just run the &lt;code&gt;./archive&lt;/code&gt; command each time you want to import new links and update the static output. It can import and export JSON (among other formats), so it's easy to script or hook up to other APIs. If you run it on a schedule and import from browser history or bookmarks regularly, you can sleep soundly knowing that the slice of the internet you care about will be automatically preserved in multiple, durable long-term formats that will be accessible for decades (or longer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, you can install ArchiveBox &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart&quot;&gt;automatically&lt;/a&gt;, follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Install&quot;&gt;manual instructions&lt;/a&gt;, or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;There are only &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Install#dependencies&quot;&gt;3 main dependencies&lt;/a&gt; beyond &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chromium&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt;, and you can skip installing them if you don't need those archive methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
git clone https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox.git
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ArchiveBox
./setup

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Export your bookmarks, then run the archive command to start archiving!&lt;/span&gt;
./archive &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;/Downloads/bookmarks.html

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Or pass in links to archive via stdin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;https://example.com&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; ./archive
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;output/index.html&lt;/code&gt; in a browser to view your archive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.sweeting.me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DEMO: archive.sweeting.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart&quot;&gt;Quickstart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/a&gt; docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because modern websites are complicated and often rely on dynamic content, ArchiveBox archives the sites in &lt;strong&gt;several different formats&lt;/strong&gt; beyond what public archiving services like Archive.org and Archive.is are capable of saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArchiveBox imports a list of URLs from stdin, remote url, or file, then adds the pages to a local archive folder using wget to create a browsable html clone, youtube-dl to extract media, and a full instance of Chrome headless for PDF, Screenshot, and DOM dumps, and more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using multiple methods and the market-dominant browser to execute JS ensures we can save even the most complex, finicky websites in at least a few high-quality, long-term data formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can import links from:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shaarli, Delicious, Reddit Saved Posts, Wallabag, Unmark.it, and any other text with links in it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can save these things for each site:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;favicon.ico&lt;/code&gt; favicon of the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com/page-name.html&lt;/code&gt; wget clone of the site, with .html appended if not present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;output.pdf&lt;/code&gt; Printed PDF of site using headless chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;screenshot.png&lt;/code&gt; 1440x900 screenshot of site using headless chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;output.html&lt;/code&gt; DOM Dump of the HTML after rendering using headless chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;archive.org.txt&lt;/code&gt; A link to the saved site on archive.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;warc/&lt;/code&gt; for the html + gzipped warc file .gz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;media/&lt;/code&gt; any mp4, mp3, subtitles, and metadata found using youtube-dl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git/&lt;/code&gt; clone of any repository for github, bitbucket, or gitlab links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;index.json&lt;/code&gt; HTML and JSON index files containing metadata and details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default it does everything, but can disable or tweak &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Configuration&quot;&gt;individual options&lt;/a&gt; via environment variables or config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archiving is additive, so you can schedule &lt;code&gt;./archive&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Scheduled-Archiving&quot;&gt;run regularly&lt;/a&gt; and pull new links into the index. All the saved content is static and indexed with JSON files, so it lives forever &amp;amp; is easily parseable, it requires no always-running backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Related Projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of great web archiving tools out there. In particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrecorder.io&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://webrecorder.io&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb&quot;&gt;pywb&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpolarized.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://getpolarized.io/&lt;/a&gt; are robust, stable pieces of software that have lots of overlap with ArchiveBox. ArchiveBox differentiates itself by being primarily a one-shot CLI tool that specializing in importing streams of links from RSS, JSON (good for automatically archiving from a stream of browser history or bookmarks on a schedule), as opposed to a desktop application or web service that requires human interaction to add links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki&quot;&gt;Github wiki system&lt;/a&gt; for documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vast treasure troves of knowledge are lost every day on the internet to link rot. As a society, we have an imperative to preserve some important parts of that treasure, just like we preserve our books, paintings, and music in physical libraries long after the originals go out of print or fade into obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's to resist censorship by saving articles before they get taken down or editied, or just to save a collection of early 2010's flash games you love to play, having the tools to archive internet content enables to you save the stuff you care most about before it dissapears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The balance between the permanence and ephemeral nature of content on the internet is part of what makes it beautiful. I don't think everything should be preserved in an automated fashion, making all content permanent and never removable, but I do think people should be able to decide for themselves and effectively archive specific content that they care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of ArchiveBox is to go beyond what the Wayback Machine and other public archiving services can do, by adding a headless browser to replay sessions accurately, and by automatically extracting all the content in multiple redundant formats that will survive being passed down to historians and archivists through many generations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Happens Now That China Won&amp;#039;t Take U.S. Recycling</title>

<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLbiwZi1t7w&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;earnest&lt;/a&gt; public-information campaigns, Americans are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;finally recycling&lt;/a&gt;. Airports, malls, schools, and office buildings across the country have bins for plastic bottles and aluminum cans and newspapers. In some cities, you can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/recycling-enforcement/396734/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;fined&lt;/a&gt; if inspectors discover that you haven’t recycled appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now much of that carefully sorted recycling is ending up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, we were sending the bulk of our recycling to China—tons and tons of it, sent over on ships to be made into goods such as shoes and bags and new plastic products. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/impl_03oct17_e.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;But last year, the country restricted&lt;/a&gt; imports of certain recyclables, including mixed paper—magazines, office paper, junk mail—and most plastics. Waste-management companies across the country are telling towns, cities, and counties that there is no longer a market for their recycling. These municipalities have two choices: pay much higher rates to get rid of recycling, or throw it all away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most are choosing the latter. “We are doing our best to be environmentally responsible, but we can’t afford it,” said Judie Milner, the city manager of Franklin, New Hampshire. Since 2010, Franklin has offered curbside recycling and encouraged residents to put paper, metal, and plastic in their green bins. When the program launched, Franklin could break even on recycling by selling it for $6 a ton. Now, Milner told me, the transfer station is charging the town $125 a ton to recycle, or $68 a ton to incinerate. One-fifth of Franklin’s residents live &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhes.nh.gov/elmi/products/cp/profiles-htm/franklin.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;below the poverty line&lt;/a&gt;, and the city government didn’t want to ask them to pay more to recycle, so all those carefully sorted bottles and cans are being burned. Milner hates knowing that Franklin is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.no-burn.org/burning-plastic-incineration-causes-air-pollution-dioxin-emissions-cost-overruns/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;releasing toxins&lt;/a&gt; into the environment, but there’s not much she can do. “Plastic is just not one of the things we have a market for,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is happening across the country. Broadway, Virginia, had a recycling program for 22 years, but recently suspended it after Waste Management told the town that prices would increase by 63 percent, and then stopped offering recycling pickup as a service. “It almost feels illegal, to throw plastic bottles away,” the town manager, Kyle O’Brien, told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a market for mixed paper, bales of the stuff started to pile up in Blaine County, Idaho; the county eventually stopped collecting it and took the 35 bales it had hoped to recycle to a landfill. The town of Fort Edward, New York, &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststar.com/news/local/after-town-s-halt-of-recycling-services-fort-edward-village/article_f6b3d677-baaf-53bb-a7de-3dac622e5534.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; its recycling program in July and admitted it had actually been taking recycling to an incinerator for months. Determined to hold out until the market turns around, the nonprofit Keep Northern Illinois Beautiful has collected 400,000 tons of plastic. But for now, it is piling the bales behind the facility where it collects plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This end of recycling comes at a time when the United States is creating more waste than ever. In 2015, the most recent year for which national data are available, America generated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/2015_smm_msw_factsheet_07242018_fnl_508_002.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;262.4 million&lt;/a&gt; tons of waste, up 4.5 percent from 2010 and 60 percent from 1985. That amounts to nearly five pounds per person a day. New York City &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsny.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/about_dsny-curbside-collections-FY2018-1.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;collected&lt;/a&gt; 934 tons of metal, plastic, and glass a day from residents last year, a 33 percent increase from 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/online-shopping-and-accumulation-of-junk/567985/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: ‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/online-shopping-and-accumulation-of-junk/567985/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are all accumulating mountains of things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/online-shopping-and-accumulation-of-junk/567985/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Americans have had little incentive to consume less. It’s inexpensive to buy products, and it’s even cheaper to throw them away at the end of their short lives. But the costs of all this garbage are growing, especially now that bottles and papers that were once recycled are now ending up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those costs is environmental: When organic waste sits in a landfill, it decomposes, emitting methane, which is bad for the climate—landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions in the country. Burning plastic may create some energy, but it also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43120041&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;produces&lt;/a&gt; carbon emissions. And while many incineration facilities bill themselves as “waste to energy” plants, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grid.unep.ch/waste/html_file/42-43_climate_change.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that they release more harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, into the air per unit of energy than do coal plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as cities are now learning, the other cost is financial. The United States still has a fair amount of landfill space left, but it’s getting expensive to ship waste hundreds of miles to those landfills. Some dumps are raising costs to deal with all this extra waste; according to one estimate, along the West Coast, landfill fees increased by $8 a ton from 2017 to 2018. Some of these costs are already being passed on to consumers, but most haven’t—yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are going to have to come to terms with a new reality: All those toothpaste tubes and shopping bags and water bottles that didn’t exist 50 years ago need to go somewhere, and creating this much waste has a price we haven’t had to pay so far. “We’ve had an ostrich-in-the-sand approach to the entire system,” said Jeremy O’Brien, director of applied research at the Solid Waste Association of North America, a trade association. “We’re producing a lot of waste ourselves, and we should take care of it ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the trash piles up, American cities are scrambling to figure out what to do with everything they had previously sent to China. But few businesses want it domestically, for one very big reason: Despite all those advertising campaigns, Americans are &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; at recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25 percent of what ends up in the blue bins is contaminated, according to the National Waste &amp;amp; Recycling Association. For decades, we’ve been throwing just about whatever we wanted—wire hangers and pizza boxes and ketchup bottles and yogurt containers—into the bin and sending it to China, where low-paid workers sorted through it and cleaned it up. That’s no longer an option. And in the United States, at least, it rarely makes sense to employ people to sort through our recycling so that it can be made into new material, because virgin plastics and paper are still cheaper in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in San Francisco, often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/how-san-francisco-became-a-global-leader-in-waste-management.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;lauded&lt;/a&gt; for its environmentalism, waste-management companies struggle to keep recycling uncontaminated. I visited a state-of-the-art facility operated by San Francisco’s recycling provider, Recology, where million-dollar machines separate aluminum from paper from plastic from garbage. But as the Recology spokesman Robert Reed walked me through the plant, he kept pointing out nonrecyclables gumming up the works. Workers wearing masks and helmets grabbed laundry baskets off a fast-moving conveyor belt of cardboard as some non-cardboard items escaped their gloved hands. Recology has to stop another machine twice a day so a technician can pry plastic bags from where they’ve clogged up the gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/IMG_7772/8bea8d007.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Bales of plastic are piled at a Recology facility in San Francisco. (Alana Semuels / The Atlantic)
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning up recycling means employing people to slowly go through materials, which is expensive. Jacob Greenberg, a commissioner in Blaine County, Idaho, told me that the county’s mixed-paper recycling was about 90 percent clean. But its paper broker said the mixed paper needed to be 99 percent clean for anyone to buy it, and elected officials didn’t want to hike fees to get there. “At what point do you feel like you’re spending more money than what it takes for people to feel good about recycling?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the challenge of educating people about what can and can’t be recycled, even as the number of items they touch on a daily basis grows. Americans tend to be “aspirational” about their recycling, tossing an item in the blue bin because it makes them feel less guilty about consuming it and throwing it away. Even in San Francisco, Reed kept pointing out items that aren’t easily recyclable but that keep showing up at the Recology plant: soy-sauce packets and pizza boxes, candy-bar wrappers and dry-cleaner bags, the lids of to-go coffee cups and plastic take-out containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can somehow figure out how to better sort recycling, some U.S. markets for plastics and paper may emerge. But selling it domestically will still be harder than it would be in a place such as China, where a booming manufacturing sector has constant demand for materials. The viability of recycling varies tremendously by locale; San Francisco can recycle its glass back into bottles in six weeks, according to Recology, while many other cities are finding that glass is so heavy and breaks so easily that it is nearly impossible to truck it to a place that will recycle it. Akron, Ohio, is just one of many cities that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cleveland.com/akron/2018/12/akrons-ban-on-recycling-glass-based-on-faulty-information.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;have ended&lt;/a&gt; glass recycling since the China policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it’s still often cheaper for companies to manufacture using new materials than recycled ones. Michael Rohwer, a director at Business for Social Responsibility, works with companies that try to be more environmentally friendly. He told me that recycled plastic costs pennies more than new plastic, and those pennies add up when you’re manufacturing millions of items. Items made of different types of plastic nearly always end up in the trash, because recyclers can’t separate the plastics from one another—Reed equates it with trying to get the sugar and eggs out of a cake after you’ve baked it. But because companies don’t bear the costs of disposal, they have no incentive to manufacture products out of material that will be easier to recycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to fix recycling is probably persuading people to buy less stuff, which would also have the benefit of reducing some of the upstream waste created when products are made. But that’s a hard sell in the United States, where consumer spending accounts for 68 percent of the GDP. The strong economy means more people have more spending money, too, and often the things they buy, such as new phones, and the places they shop, such as Amazon, are designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/amazon-selling-machine/574045/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;sell them&lt;/a&gt; even more things. The average American spent 7 percent more on food and 8 percent more on personal-care products and services in 2017 than in 2016, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;government data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/amazon-selling-machine/574045/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: The Amazon selling machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some places are still trying to get people to buy less. The city of San Francisco, for instance, is trying to get residents to think of a fourth &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; beyond “reduce, reuse, and recycle”—“refuse.” It wants people to be smarter about what they purchase, avoiding plastic bottles and straws and other disposable goods. But it’s been tough in a place centered on acquiring the newest technology. “This is our big challenge: How do you take a culture like San Francisco and get people excited about less?” Debbie Raphael, the director of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, told me. The city passed an ordinance that required that 10 percent of beverages sold be available in reusable containers, and it is trying to make reuse “hip” through an online campaign and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recology.com/better-at-the-bin/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'None'&quot;&gt;dedicated website&lt;/a&gt;, Raphael said. San Francisco and other Bay Area cities have banned plastic bags and plastic straws, but that option isn’t available in many other parts of the country, where recently passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/01/29/banning-the-bans-state-and-local-officials-clash-over-plastic-bags&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'20',r'None'&quot;&gt;state laws&lt;/a&gt; prevent cities from banning products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even in San Francisco, the most careful consumers still generate a lot of waste. Plastic clamshell containers are difficult to recycle because the material they’re made of is so flimsy—but it’s hard to find berries not sold in those containers, even at most farmers’ markets. Go into a Best Buy or Target in San Francisco to buy headphones or a charger, and you’ll still end up with plastic packaging to throw away. Amazon has tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/sustainability/packaging&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'21',r'None'&quot;&gt;reduce waste&lt;/a&gt; by sending products in white and blue plastic envelopes, but when I visited the Recology plant, they littered the floor because they’re very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/11/why-amazons-new-streamlined-packaging-is-jamming-up-recycling-centers/?utm_term=.508cb51285ba&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'22',r'None'&quot;&gt;hard to recycle&lt;/a&gt;. Even at Recology, an employee-owned company that benefits when people recycle well, the hurdles to getting rid of plastics were evident. Reed chided me for eating my daily Chobani yogurt out of small, five-ounce containers rather than out of big, 32-ounce tubs, but I saw a five-ounce Yoplait container in a trash can of the control room of the Recology plant. While there, Reed handed me a pair of small orange earplugs meant to protect my ears from the noise of the plant. They were wrapped in a type of flimsy plastic that is nearly impossible to recycle. When I left the plant, I kept the earplugs and the plastic in my bag, not sure what to do with them. Eventually, I threw them in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Speedrunning Windows 95</title>
<link>https://hackaday.com/2019/03/09/speedrunning-windows-95/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hackaday.com/2019/03/09/speedrunning-windows-95/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Speedrunning is the practice of attempting to beat a videogame in as short a time as possible. There are a huge variety of methods and styles. There are 100% completion speedruns, tool-assisted speedruns, and speedruns that just focus on getting to the game over screen as quickly as possible by hook or by crook. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbTptOHZDmk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Now, there’s a world record speedrun, installing Windows 95B in just 1 minute 10.9 seconds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current best attempts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gJkoQ-_3MS2FP7aUlO5v4pQrhrwy0XjQvuojKlnre48/edit#gid=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;collected in a Google Sheets document&lt;/a&gt;. So far, there have been few competitors but we expect to see more activity in future. The current rules for world record competition require original floppy and CD-ROM images to be used, but there are no limits on hardware, so records should tumble as time goes on. All the top times have been completed in virtual machines, but we’d love to see an attempt made on raw hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all kicked off when [oscareczek] grew tired of trying to compete in traditional gaming speedruns, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/9yvns6/wr_windows_95b_installation_desktop_in_34999/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;so invented a new category instead.&lt;/a&gt; Competition has already come a long way from that original 4 minute time, and competitors are now considering advanced techniques such as RAM disks to speed their runs. All keystrokes are by hand at the moment, but we could see a tool-assisted competition starting up in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen speedrunning techniques pushed to impressive limits before – &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackaday.com/2014/01/10/teaching-mario-to-play-pong-and-snake-through-innumerable-exploits/&quot;&gt;like running Pong within Super Mario World, just for fun.&lt;/a&gt; Video after the break.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US citizens will need a visa to visit Europe starting in 2021</title>
<link>https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-citizens-need-visas-to-visit-europe-in-2021/index.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-citizens-need-visas-to-visit-europe-in-2021/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;Paragraph__cite&quot;&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;span&gt;US citizens visiting parts of Europe will need authorization from the European Union come 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Paragraph__component&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EU &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4367_en.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; it was creating a European Travel Information and Authorization System, or ETIAS, that will require &quot;pre-travel screening for security and migration risks of travellers benefiting from visa-free access to the Schengen area.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Schengen Area is a zone of 26 European countries that do not have internal borders and allow people to move between them freely, including countries such as Spain, France, Greece, Germany, Italy and Poland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, US citizens can travel to Europe for up to 90 days without any sort of travel authorization. ETIAS will change that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Visa-free travelers, including US citizens, will need to request ETIAS authorization before visiting the Schengen Area. They can complete an application and pay a service fee of 7 euros (about $8) online. The authorization is valid for three years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Completing the online application should not take more than 10 minutes with automatic approval being given in over 95% of cases,&quot; the European Commission said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We are aware of the European Union's plan to implement its own travel information and authorization system, similar to the U.S. ESTA, to contribute to a more efficient management of the EU's external borders and improve internal security,&quot; a US State Department official said in a statement. &quot;Each country has the right to determine its standards for entry.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The official added that the &quot;ETIAS authorization is not a visa.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States won't be the only country affected by the changes. From 2021, citizens from 60 countries will be required to apply for the ETIAS before entering the Schengen Area. Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Israel and Mauritius are among those countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The European Parliament agreed to establish ETIAS in July. At the time, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, indicated that the requirement was put in place for security reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Paragraph__component&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The new ETIAS will ensure that we no longer have an information gap on visa-free travelers,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4367_en.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he said in a statement.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Anyone who poses a migratory or security risk will be identified before they even travel to EU borders.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) as a visa. It is an authorization system. The story also incorrectly stated that this announcement was made on Friday. The headline and story have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An “acoustic metamaterial” that can cancel 94 percent of sound</title>

<description>&lt;header readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;Mechanical engineers have developed an “acoustic metamaterial” that can cancel 94 percent of sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bannerContainer bannerContainer-contentWidth&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bu.edu/research/files/2019/02/resized-19-1023-SOUND-025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boston University Ph. D. candidate Reza Ghaffarivardavagh poses with his research team. Reza holds the noise cancellation devices his team developed over his ears while his teammates make noise banging a pot, playing a trumpet, and a boombox in the background&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-30151&quot;/&gt;Boston University mechanical engineers have created synthetic, sound-silencing structures—acoustic metamaterials—that can block 94% of sounds. Reza Ghaffarivardavagh (ENG) (front center) holds two of the open, ringlike structures over his ears while Stephan Anderson (MED) (left), Xin Zhang (ENG) (rear center), and Jacob Nikolajczyk (ENG) (right) make a racket. Photo by Cydney Scott&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;byline-label&quot;&gt;By &lt;span class=&quot;byline-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;byline-author vcard&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;Kat J. McAlpine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sounds would you mute if you could? A pair of Boston University mechanical engineers are asking that question, with the ever-increasing din of drone propellers, airplane turbines, MRI machines, and urban noise pollution blaring in the mind’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s sound barriers are literally thick heavy walls,” says Reza Ghaffarivardavagh. Although noise-mitigating barricades, called sound baffles, can help drown out the whoosh of rush hour traffic or contain the symphony of music within concert hall walls, they are a clunky approach not well suited to situations where airflow is also critical. Imagine barricading a jet engine’s exhaust vent—the plane would never leave the ground. Instead, workers on the tarmac wear earplugs to protect their hearing from the deafening roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xin Zhang and Ghaffarivardavagh were enticed by an alluring question: “Can we design a structure that can block noise but preserve air passage?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaning on their mathematical prowess and the technology of 3D printing, it turns out they can. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.024302&quot;&gt;January 2019 &lt;em&gt;Physical Review&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers argue that it’s quite possible to silence noise using an open, ringlike structure, created to mathematically perfect specifications, for cutting out sounds while maintaining airflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Numbers and noise control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always been interested in acoustics,” says Ghaffarivardavagh, who finished his BSc in mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, before coming to Boston University for graduate school. Now, in Zhang’s lab, he’s close to finishing his PhD. “I like to work on something that I can hear or see the result. Something that I can have an impact on with issues we are facing nowadays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lived in other major cities before coming to Boston, Zhang and Ghaffarivardavagh have always marveled at the layered urban soundscape enveloping them. In Boston, the cacophony of the city is garbled together from airplanes flying overhead, the engines and horns of cars, trucks, and buses on the street, the rumble and screech of MBTA trolleys, and the hum of building appliances and power sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City life is so noisy, you have to find a way to create quiet moments, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got them dreaming up a sound baffle that wasn’t a barrier at all, but instead an open conduit. Such a feat could only be possible by developing a material with unusual and unnatural properties (known as a metamaterial), in this case with the ability to exert an isolated influence on sounds—an acoustic metamaterial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been working on metamaterials for more than a decade,” says Zhang, a multidisciplinary professor at the College of Engineering and the Photonics Center. “But it was Reza that gradually got me more excited about the fundamental idea of a marriage between acoustics and metamaterials. If you ask me and my colleagues, acoustic metamaterials is a relatively young direction…. It’s the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mute button, incarnated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang let mathematics—a shared passion that has buoyed both of their engineering careers and made them well-suited research partners—guide them toward a workable design for what the acoustic metamaterial would look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sound is made by very tiny disturbances in the air. So, our goal is to silence those tiny vibrations,” Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang say. “If we want the inside of a structure to be open air, then we have to keep in mind that this will be the pathway through which sound travels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They calculated the dimensions and specifications that the metamaterial would need to have in order to interfere with the transmitted sound waves, preventing sound—but not air—from being radiated through the open structure. The basic premise is that the metamaterial needs to be shaped in such a way that it sends incoming sounds back to where they came from, they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;On one end of the pipe, a loudspeaker blasts a noise. On the other end, the open acoustic silencing metamaterial redirects the sound as long as it's fitted in place. Video courtesy of the Zhang lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a test case, they decided to create a structure that could silence sound from a loudspeaker. Based on their calculations, they modeled the physical dimensions that would most effectively silence noises. Bringing those models to life, they used 3D printing to materialize an open, noise-canceling structure made of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying it out in the lab, the researchers sealed the loudspeaker into one end of a PVC pipe. On the other end, the tailor-made acoustic metamaterial was fastened into the opening. With the hit of the play button, the experimental loudspeaker set-up came oh-so-quietly to life in the lab. Standing in the room, based on your sense of hearing alone, you’d never know that the loudspeaker was blasting an irritatingly high-pitched note. If, however, you peered into the PVC pipe, you would see the loudspeaker’s subwoofers thrumming away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metamaterial, ringing around the internal perimeter of the pipe’s mouth, worked like a mute button incarnate until the moment when Ghaffarivardavagh reached down and pulled it free. The lab suddenly echoed with the screeching of the loudspeaker’s tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The moment we first placed and removed the silencer…was literally night and day,” says Jacob Nikolajczyk, who in addition to being a study coauthor and former undergraduate researcher in Zhang’s lab is a passionate vocal performer. “We had been seeing these sorts of results in our computer modeling for months—but it is one thing to see modeled sound pressure levels on a computer, and another to hear its impact yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing sound levels with and without the metamaterial fastened in place, the team found that they could silence nearly all—94 percent to be exact—of the noise, making the sounds emanating from the loudspeaker imperceptible to the human ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A quieter world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that their prototype has proved so effective, the researchers have some big ideas about how their acoustic-silencing metamaterial could go to work making the real world quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drones are a very hot topic,” Zhang says. Companies like Amazon are interested in using drones to deliver goods, she says, and “people are complaining about the potential noise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The culprit is the upward-moving fan motion,” Ghaffarivardavagh says. “If we can put sound-silencing open structures beneath the drone fans, we can cancel out the sound radiating toward the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;

Inside the outer ring, a helical pattern interferes with sounds, blocking them from transmitting through the open center while preserving air’s ability to flow through.

&lt;p&gt;Closer to home—or the office—fans and HVAC systems could benefit from acoustic metamaterials that render them silent yet still enable hot or cold air to be circulated unencumbered throughout a building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang also point to the unsightliness of the sound barriers used today to reduce noise pollution from traffic and see room for an aesthetic upgrade. “Our structure is super lightweight, open, and beautiful. Each piece could be used as a tile or brick to scale up and build a sound-canceling, permeable wall,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape of acoustic-silencing metamaterials, based on their method, is also completely customizable, Ghaffarivardavagh says. The outer part doesn’t need to be a round ring shape in order to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can design the outer shape as a cube or hexagon, anything really,” he says. “When we want to create a wall, we will go to a hexagonal shape” that can fit together like an open-air honeycomb structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such walls could help contain many types of noises. Even those from the intense vibrations of an MRI machine, Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Stephan Anderson, a professor of radiology at BU School of Medicine and a coauthor of the study, the acoustic metamaterial could potentially be scaled “to fit inside the central bore of an MRI machine,” shielding patients from the sound during the imaging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang says the possibilities are endless, since the noise mitigation method can be customized to suit nearly any environment: “The idea is that we can now mathematically design an object that can block the sounds of anything,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This work was supported by a Boston University Materials Innovation Grant and Dean’s Catalyst Award.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Boston University engineers have created a sound baffle that isn’t a barrier at all, but instead an open conduit that allows air to pass through. Such a feat was only possible by developing a synthetic material with the special ability to cancel sounds but not air flow—an acoustic metamaterial.</og:description>

<title>Show HN: My CV is also a bootloader</title>
<link>https://github.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader#</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader/master/demo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader/master/demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ScreenShot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PDF attached in this repository is both a working PDF of my CV and a custom bootloader created by me to impress technical recruiters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19344146&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Check the discussion in HN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a tiny bootloader of 1018 bytes. Then I just copy the first bytes of my bootloader at the beginning of my CV and that is it, a working PDF and bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I try it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! You can do so by two means, in real hardware (I spend a lot of time making it compatible) or in an emulated environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Real hardware&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; All the data on the USB will be lost, please make sure you have a backup before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Win32 Disk Imager&lt;/a&gt; and use the PDF as the input image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recover your USB just right click on it and format normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Linux&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Please be very careful with this command. If you select the wrong drive &lt;strong&gt;you will lose data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a USB, check the device name (you can use df -h) and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dd if=cv.pdf of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=2880
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where X is your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recover your USB just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://gparted.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gparted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Emulated environment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Qemu&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=cv.pdf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Bochs:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a bochsrc.txt file with this contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;megs: 32
romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xfffe0000
vgaromimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest
floppya: 1_44=cv.pdf, status=inserted
boot: a
log: bochsout.txt
mouse: enabled=0
display_library: x, options=&quot;gui_debug&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then execute bochs as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
bochs -f bochsrc.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compiling from source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
nasm boot.asm -o boot.bin
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your vanilla PDF, CV_english.pdf in this example, and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
qpdf --stream-data=uncompress CV_english.pdf uncompressed.pdf
cat boot.bin uncompressed.pdf &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; cv.pdf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a learning experience. I realized that I had no practical knowledge on how the booting process works, and also my assembly was a little bit rusty. This is a project I really enjoyed, although it was a little bit overwhelming at some points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you explain how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried my best to comment the code thoroughly, including my optimization decisions as well as the encoding of the sprites. I have also linked to a couple of Stackoverflow answers for deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now your PDF is bigger!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but 1018 bytes bigger or 0.01% bigger. For comparison, the gif in this readme is 2778093 bytes or 2728,97 times bigger! The Firefox icon is 8532 bytes, 8.38 times bigger!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A generalised solution to distributed consensus</title>
<link>https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/08/a-generalised-solution-to-distributed-consensus/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/08/a-generalised-solution-to-distributed-consensus/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06776&quot;&gt;A generalised solution to distributed consensus&lt;/a&gt; Howard &amp;amp; Mortier, &lt;em&gt;arXiv’19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a draft paper that Heidi Howard recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1098167557792718849?s=21&quot;&gt;shared with the world via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/2019/02/towards-an-intuitive-high-performance-consensus-algorithm/&quot;&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;. It caught my eye for promising a generalised solution to the consensus problem, and also for using reasoning over immutable state to get there. The state maintained at each server is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/06/keeping-calm-when-distributed-consistency-is-easy/&quot;&gt;monotonic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consensus is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/03/01/cant-we-all-just-agree/&quot;&gt;notoriously hard problem&lt;/a&gt;, and Howard has been deep in the space for several years now. See for example the 2016 paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/27/flexible-paxos-quorum-intersection-revisited/&quot;&gt;Flexible Paxos&lt;/a&gt;. The quest for the holy grail here is to find a unifying and easily understandable protocol that can be instantiated in different configurations allowing different trade-offs to be made according to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper re-examines the problem of distributed consensus with the aim of improving performance and understanding. We proceed as follows. Once we have defined the problem of consensus, we propose a generalised solution to consensus that uses only immutable state to enable more intuitive reasoning about correctness. We subsequently prove that both Paxos and Fast Paxos are instances of our generalised consensus algorithm and thus show that both algorithms are conservative in their approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The distributed consensus problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a set of servers (at least two) that need to agree upon a value. Clients take as input a value to be written, and produce as output the value agreed by the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The output value must have been the input value of a client (ruling out simple solutions that always output a fixed value for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All clients that produce an output must output the same value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All clients must eventually produce an output if the system is reliable and synchronous for a sufficient period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we’re talking here about the ‘inner game’ – this is just to agree upon a single value, whereas in a real deployment we’ll probably run multiple rounds of the protocol to agree upon a series of values. Moreover, we’re assuming here that the set of clients and servers is fixed and known to the clients. The ‘clients’ are probably not end-user clients, but more likely to be system processes making using of a consensus service. Configuration changes and membership epochs is another layer we’ll probably add-on in real deployments, but is also out of scope here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building blocks: immutable registers and quorums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a fixed set of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; servers, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_0%2C+S_1%2C+...%2C+S_n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_0, S_1, ..., S_n&quot; title=&quot;S_0, S_1, ..., S_n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;. Each server has a tape it can write to, aka, an infinite array of &lt;strong&gt;write-once&lt;/strong&gt; persistent registers, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_0%2C+R_1%2C+...&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;R_0, R_1, ...&quot; title=&quot;R_0, R_1, ...&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the tape is blank – all registers are &lt;em&gt;unwritten&lt;/em&gt;. Once we write a value in a register slot it can never be changed. In addition to values provided by clients the system has one special value, denoted &lt;em&gt;nil&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbot&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\bot&quot; title=&quot;\bot&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be interested in sets of values from the same register slot across all servers. A &lt;em&gt;register set&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; title=&quot;i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is the set of all registers &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;R_i&quot; title=&quot;R_i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; across all servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If enough of the registers in a register set have the same (non- &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbot&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\bot&quot; title=&quot;\bot&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;) value, then we will say that the servers have &lt;em&gt;decided&lt;/em&gt; upon that value. How many registers in a register set is &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; though? That’s something we get to decide as part of the configuration of the protocol. In fact, we specify more than just the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of register values that must be in agreement, we also specify which servers they belong to. A (non-empty) subset of servers that can decide a value between them is called a &lt;em&gt;quorum&lt;/em&gt;. More precisely, “&lt;em&gt;a quorum, Q, is a (non-empty) subset of servers, such that if all servers have the same (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; in the same register then &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is said to be decided.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word ‘quorum’ is often strongly associated with ‘majority,’ but note that this doesn’t have to be the case. The specification allows us to declare a quorum containing just a single server if we want to. The dictionary definition of quorum is “the minimum number of members of an assembly or society that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid.” Note that there is also no requirement here for overlapping quorum memberships (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each register set is associated with a set of quorums. That is, on a register-set by register-set basis, we can specify exactly which subsets of servers are allowed to decide a value. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-1.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why on earth we would want to have different quorum sets for different register sets— since we’re only agreeing on a single value at the end of the day!— will become more apparent when we look at how to layer a consensus protocol on top of the registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given quorum configurations and register values for register sets, we can see if any quorum is satisfied and a decision reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of all registers can be represented in a table, known as a &lt;em&gt;state table&lt;/em&gt;, where each column represents the state of one server and each row represents a register set. By combining a configuration with a state table, we can determine whether any decision(s) have been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-2.jpeg?w=520&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have to be a little careful here and remember that the state table is a logical construct. Each server knows the values of its own registers, and clients can maintain their own view of the global state table as they receive information from servers. Given the immutable constructs though, we know that once a client has assembled enough information to call a value decided, it is finally decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Four rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some rules that need to be followed for this to work as a consensus system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quorum agreement&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only write a (non-nil) value to register &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; provided no value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v'&quot; title=&quot;v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; where &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cneq+v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; title=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; can be decided by the quorums in registers sets 0 to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+-+1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r - 1&quot; title=&quot;r - 1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two rules are pretty straightforward. Rule 3 ensures that all decisions made by a register set will be for the same value, while rule 4 ensures that all decisions made by different register sets are for the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeying these rules places some further constraints on the system configuration. Say we have two quorums for register set &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BS_0%5C%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\{S_0\}&quot; title=&quot;\{S_0\}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BS_1%5C%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\{S_1\}&quot; title=&quot;\{S_1\}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;. A client writing to the register on &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_0&quot; title=&quot;S_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; has no way of knowing whether or not some other client might be writing a different value to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_1&quot; title=&quot;S_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;, hence we couldn’t uphold rule 3. There are three ways we can handle this situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trivial solution is to allow only one quorum per register set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With multiple quorums, we can require that all quorums for a register set intersect (i.e., any two quorums will have at least one overlapping member)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &lt;em&gt;client restricted configurations&lt;/em&gt;. Here ownership of a given register set is assigned to a given client, such that only that client can write values in that register set. Assuming the client is consistent with the values it writes, all will be well. One such strategy would be a round-robin ownership of register sets:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-4.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comply with rule 4, clients need to consult their emerging view of the global state table, aka their &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; state table, and figure out whether any decision has been or could be reached by earlier register sets. The client maintains a decision table with one entry for each quorum of each register set. This table tracks what the client knows about the decisions made by the quorum. Possible values for a quorum are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ANY – any value could yet be decided. (All quorums for all register sets start out in this state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAYBE &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; – if this quorum reaches a decision, then the value will be &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DECIDED &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; – the value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; has been decided by the quorum (a final state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NONE – the quorum will not decide a value; a final state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the client receives information from servers, it updates the decision table according to the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients use the decision table to implement the four rules for correctness as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-5.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to make reasoning about correctness sufficiently intuitive that proofs are not necessary to make a convincing case for the safety…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be pleased to know however that proofs &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; included, and you’ll find them in Appendix A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paxos over immutable registers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a paper summary, I guess this write-up so far has been a spectacular fail! I’m already over my target length, and have probably taken more words to explain the core ideas than the original paper does!! The only defence I can offer is that there are no short-cuts when it comes to thinking about consensus 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of the paper is to show that the register-based scheme just outlined can be instantiated to realise a number of consensus schemes from the literature, including Paxos and Fast Paxos. I’m out of space to do that proper justice, but here’s a sneak-peek at the core Paxos algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that Paxos is a conservative instance of our generalised solution to consensus. The configuration used by Paxos is majorities for all register sets.. Paxos also uses client restricted for all register sets. The purpose of phase one is to implement rule 4, and the purpose of phase two is to implement rule 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-8.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you differentiate between the quorums used for each register set and which phase of Paxos the quorum is used for, you can arrive at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/27/flexible-paxos-quorum-intersection-revisited/&quot;&gt;Flexible Paxos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mixing it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 5 of the paper shows how to derive Fast Paxos, and in section six you’ll find a brief sketch of three other points in the configuration space named co-located consensus, fixed-majority consensus, and reconfigurable consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we have reframed the problem of distributed consensus in terms of write-once registers and thus proposed a generalised solution to distributed consensus. We have demonstrated that this solution not only uniﬁes existing algorithms including Paxos and Fast Paxos but also demonstrates that such algorithms are conservative as their quorum intersection requirements and quorum agreement rules can be substantially weakened. We have illustrated the power of our generalised consensus algorithm by proposing three novel algorithms for consensus, demonstrating a few interesting points on the diverse array of algorithms made possible by our abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
