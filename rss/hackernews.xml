<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is still reeling from the fallout from its Cambridge Analytica scandal more than a year ago, as multiple former recruiters say candidates are turning down job offers from what was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/facebook-is-no-longer-glassdoors-best-place-to-work.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;once considered&lt;/a&gt; the best place to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half a dozen recruiters who left Facebook in recent months told CNBC that the tech company experienced a significant decrease in job offer acceptance rates after the March 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a data firm improperly accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users and used it to target ads for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This impact to Facebook's recruiting efforts is important as the company adds thousands of employees each year. These new workers are key to the company's ability to innovate and improve its existing products. The company faces cutthroat competition for talent from other top tech companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and countless start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, Facebook saw a sharp increase in students at top universities who are declining the company's job offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among top schools, such as Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Ivy League universities, Facebook’s acceptance rate for full-time positions offered to new graduates has fallen from an average of 85% for the 2017-2018 school year to between 35% and 55% as of December, according to former Facebook recruiters. The biggest decline came from Carnegie Mellon University, where the acceptance rate for new recruits dropped to 35%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drop has been echoed elsewhere in the company's recruiting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has seen a decline in acceptance rates among software engineer candidates for its product teams. Those teams have seen their acceptance rates fell from nearly 90% in late 2016 to almost 50% in early 2019, according to one recruiter who left recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook spokesperson Anthony Harrison said the company's head count grew 36% year over year from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. Facebook disputed the accuracy of the recruiters' accounts, but declined to point out any specific points that were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the publication of this story, Harrison contacted CNBC to say &quot;these numbers are totally wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Facebook regularly ranks high on industry lists of most attractive employers,&quot; Harrison said in a statement. &quot;For example, in the last year we were rated as #1 on Indeed's Top Rated Workplaces, #2 on LinkedIn's Top Companies, and #7 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work. Our annual intern survey showed exceptionally strong sentiment and intent to return and we continue to see strong acceptance rates across University Recruiting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Facebook candidates are asking much tougher questions about the company's approach to privacy, according to multiple former recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decline has put pressure on Facebook recruiters to fill a backlog of open positions under more difficult pressures than they've faced previously, the recruiters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Usually half of the close is done for recruiters with the brand Facebook has,&quot; one recruiter who left in 2019 said. &quot;This is the first time a lot of our folks have had to be on top of their game to make sure top candidates don't slip through the cracks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drop in candidate interest follows other signs that show more tech workers are reconsidering working for Facebook. In December, former Facebook employees told CNBC that they were hearing from more current Facebook employees who were reaching out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/02/facebook-employees-calling-former-colleagues-to-look-for-jobs-outside.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;ask about job opportunities elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. And in April, executives at health-tech start-ups told CNBC that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/facebook-google-scandals-ease-recruiting-for-health-start-ups.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;poaching employees from Facebook has become easier&lt;/a&gt; after the company's scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandals have impacted candidate interest and have hurt morale among recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The biggest thing that impacted people at Facebook is that we found out information at the same time as the general public did,&quot; one recruiter who left recently said. &quot;It was like, 'Wait, shouldn't one of our leaders have told us about this first versus our parents or friends reaching out?' It was a shock.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has lost candidates to other top companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can offer salaries and signing bonuses as good as Facebook's with much less scandal, recruiters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has also lost candidates to start-ups that are gearing up to go public or have just gone public, such as Airbnb, Slack, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UBER&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LYFT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;, the former recruiters said. Several candidates have also opted for high-potential start-ups, including Robinhood and Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's scandals are not the only reason for Facebook's new recruiting struggles, the recruiters said. There are a number of other reasons, including the skyrocketing cost of living in the Bay Area and the cutthroat competition for talent among top tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some candidates have said they're not interested due to concerns about the general culture of the company as well as its leadership. Others still say they don't want to be involved with the company that was responsible for electing President Donald Trump or that they don't want to work for a company that has Peter Thiel, a notable investor and staunch Trump supporter, on its board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other candidates, especially students, are also passing on Facebook's offers because they simply don't use the company's apps as much as previous generations and are therefore less inspired to work for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The privacy scandals, the Cambridge Analytica stuff — students aren't as interested in going to Facebook anymore,&quot; a former Facebook university recruiter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/how-to-see-which-facebook-apps-have-access-to-your-data.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here's how to see which apps have access to your Facebook data — and cut them off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zero Cost Abstractions</title>
<link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of a &lt;strong&gt;zero cost abstraction&lt;/strong&gt; is very important to certain programming languages, like Rust and C++, which intend to enable users to write programs with excellent performance profiles with relatively little effort. Since this idea is fundamental to the design of Rust and my work, I want to investigate, for a moment, what exactly a zero cost abstraction even is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is summarized in its original by Bjarne Stroustrup, the original developer of C++:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this definition, there are two factors that make something a proper zero cost abstraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No global costs:&lt;/strong&gt; A zero cost abstraction ought not to negatively impact the performance of programs that don’t use it. For example, it can’t require every program carry a heavy language runtime to benefit the only programs that use the feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimal performance:&lt;/strong&gt; A zero cost abstractoin ought to compile to the best implementation of the solution that someone would have written with the lower level primitives. It can’t introduce additional costs that could be avoided without the abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I think its important to keep in mind that there is a third requirement for something to be a zero cost abstraction. It’s often overlooked because its simply a requirement of all good abstractions, zero cost or not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve users’ experience:&lt;/strong&gt; The point of abstraction is to provide a new tool, assembled from lower level components, which enable users to more easily write the programs they want ot write. A zero cost abstraction, like all abstractions, must actually offer a better experience than the alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these are of course ideals that can never be fully realized, and this third in particular, well - there’s no accounting for taste. But for zero cost abstractions, the third point is actually especially important, because zero cost abstractions are competing with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; different alternatives. On the one hand, it must be better than handwriting code with the same performance profile yourself, that’s rather clear. But on the other, it must also be better than eating the performance cost and using an abstraction which isn’t zero cost. That doesn’t mean we need to be strictly better than the non-zero cost abstraction, because the performance cost is a factor, but we do have to be within spitting distance so that whatever additional programmer overhead you take on to be “zero cost” feels worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think to some extent Rust has tried to cheat this by making non-zero cost abstractions actively unpleasant to write, making it &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like the zero cost abstraction is better. I think this is a mistake that hurts the overall UX of the language and probably just keeps some people from using it at all, hurting our overall goals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say, also, that actually creating a zero cost abstraction that achieves this trifecta is both incredibly difficult and incredibly awesome. Rust has only really done this excellently a few times (all extremely high impact), and having been involved in what I think is going to be one of those success stories - async/await of course - it feels like holding fire in your hands. Last September I commented to a friend that I was worried I would never do any work as good as the work I had just done (in reference to the Pin API), and I really did feel that. But we rarely achieve something so great, because its extremely difficult and involves a fair amount of luck as well (many problems probably just don’t have a really great zero cost abstraction yet to be discovered, at least within the design constraints prior decisions have put around them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear about what I mean, I want to list a few of the really great zero cost abstractions in Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership and borrowing.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course this is the biggest one, guaranteed memory and thread safety without a garbage collector is Rust’s original, huge success story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterator and closure APIs.&lt;/strong&gt; This is another classic. While there are some cases where internal iteration might be optimized better, the fact that you can write map, filter, iterative for loops, and so on over slices and be optimized to the equivalent of some handwritten C is absolutely astounding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Async/await and Futures.&lt;/strong&gt; The Futures API is an important example, because the early versions of futures hit the “zero cost” part of zero cost abstraction really well, but was not actually providing a good enough UX to drive adoption. By adding pinning to support async/await, references across awaits, and so on, we’ve made a product that I really think will solve users’ problems and make Rust more viable for writing high performance network services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsafe and the module boundary.&lt;/strong&gt; Underlying all of these, and every one of Rust’s success stories, is the notion of unsafe blocks and privacy that allow us to dip into raw pointer manipulation to build these zero cost abstractions. None of Rust’s brilliant features would be possible without this really fundamental ability to break the rules locally to extend the system beyond what the typechecker can handle. This is the zero cost abstraction that is the mother of all other zero cost abstractions in Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other areas, we still haven’t succeeded so much at finding zero cost abstractions. One example of this is the trait object as a solution for dynamically dispatched polymorphism. (Note here that the dynamic dispatch is a part of the &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; here, so the virtual call is not non-zero cost.) The problem is that the concept of object safety, as well as sized and unsized types, and probably just some bad ergonomics around the coercions, has made trait objects really unwieldly to work with; I’m usually pretty annoyed when I have to use them. For a good 18 months at least I’ve wanted to really dig into this problem space, but other things have always taken priority.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sony and Microsoft set rivalry aside for cloud gaming alliance</title>
<link>https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Sony-and-Microsoft-set-rivalry-aside-for-streaming-alliance</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Sony-and-Microsoft-set-rivalry-aside-for-streaming-alliance</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TOKYO -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Sony-Corp&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft, bitter rivals in the video game console wars, will team up in on-demand gaming to better compete with newcomers like Google as the industry's main battlefield looks poised to shift to the cloud, Nikkei learned Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recent trip to the U.S., Sony President and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida signed a memorandum of understanding with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on a strategic tie-up. While details have yet to be hammered out, the partnership will center on artificial intelligence and the cloud, according to an announcement by Microsoft early Friday Japan time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter category includes plans for joint development of cloud gaming technology. While this market is expected to grow as ultrafast fifth-generation wireless gains traction, such services require much processing power on the provider's end to deliver games with high-quality graphics and minimal lag. Sony and Microsoft plan to leverage the American computing behemoth's data centers for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Nintendo-Co.-Ltd&quot;&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, long dominated the gaming landscape. But the rise of mobile gaming has brought competition from such other players as China's &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Tencent-Holdings-Ltd&quot;&gt;Tencent Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, which publishes the mobile version of the wildly popular PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moving onto their turf are big tech companies that already have the powerful server networks needed for effective streaming as well as massive built-in bases of potential customers. These include Google and its planned Stadia cloud gaming platform, as well as Apple, which announced the Apple Arcade subscription service in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of new rivals and technology spurred the Sony-Microsoft team-up, though it will not mean an end to the console wars. The PlayStation and Xbox brands will continue to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside gaming, the two companies will consider combining image sensors from Sony -- which controls half the global market -- with Microsoft AI technology to develop electronic &quot;eyes&quot; for self-driving vehicles. They will also discuss incorporating Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant into televisions, speakers and other Sony products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tie-up is an indication of Sony's shifting strategy. The Japanese company is focusing resources on areas where it can effectively use its strengths, such as games and image sensors, and becoming more open to partnerships in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hopes to use the alliance to strengthen its cloud business and gain an edge over Google and Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time Sony and Microsoft have worked together. They announced collaborations in home electronics in 1998 and music distribution technology in 1999. This wider-ranging tie-up aims to help both compete more effectively in a fast-changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Police fine pedestrian for disorderly behaviour after he tried to cover his face</title>
<link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7036141/Police-fine-pedestrian-90-facial-recognition-camera-row.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7036141/Police-fine-pedestrian-90-facial-recognition-camera-row.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Police fined a pedestrian £90 for disorderly behaviour after he tried to cover his face when he saw a controversial facial recognition camera on a street in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/london/index.html&quot; id=&quot;mol-6c1c2fc0-77c5-11e9-81d3-d7d98b5046db&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Officers set up the camera on a van in Romford, East London, which then cross-checked photos of faces of passers-by against a database of wanted criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But one man was unimpressed about being filmed and covered his face with his hat and jacket, before being stopped by officers who took his picture anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;After being pulled aside, the man told police: 'If I want to cover me face, I'll cover me face. Don't push me over when I'm walking down the street.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;It comes just weeks after it was claimed the new technology incorrectly identified members of the public in 96 per cent of matches made between 2016 and 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The cameras have been rolled out in a trial in parts of Britain, with the Met making its first arrest last December when shoppers in London's West End were scanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But their use has sparked a privacy debate, with civil liberties group Big Brother Watch branding the move a 'breach of fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of assembly'. Police argue they are&lt;span&gt; necessary to crack down on spiralling crime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Officers previously insisted people could decline to be scanned, before later clarifying that anyone trying to avoid scanners may be stopped and searched.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;It was first deployed by South Wales Police ahead of the Champions League final in Cardiff in 2007, but wrongly matched more than 2,000 people to possible criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Police and security services worldwide are keen to use facial recognition technology to bolster their efforts to fight crime and identify suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But they have been hampered by the unreliability of the software, with some trials failing to correctly identify a single person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The technology made incorrect matches in every case during two deployments at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford last year, according to Big Brother Watch.

&lt;div class=&quot;ins cleared mol-factbox-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police uses facial recognition technology called NeoFace, developed by Japanese IT firm NEC, which matches faces up to a so-called watch list of offenders wanted by the police and courts for existing offences. Cameras scan faces in its view measuring the structure of each face, creating a digital version that is searched up against the watch list. If a match is detected, an officer on the scene is alerted, who will be able to see the camera image and the watch list image, before deciding whether to stop the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;In Romford, the man was fined £90 at the scene by officers, who also arrested three other people during the day thanks to the technology, according to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;class&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0795c8w&quot;&gt;BBC Click&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;After being stopped he asked an officer: 'How would you like it if you walked down the street and someone grabbed your shoulder? You wouldn't like it, would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The officer told him: 'Calm yourself down or you're going in handcuffs. It's up to you. Wind your neck in.' But the man replied: 'You wind your neck in.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;After being fined, the man told a reporter: 'The chap told me down the road - he said they've got facial recognition. So I walked past like that (covering my face).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'It's a cold day as well. As soon as I've done that, the police officer's asked me to come to him. So I've got me back up. I said to him 'f*** off', basically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'I've got a now £90 fine, here you go, look at that. Thanks lads, £90. Well done.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Silkie Carlo, the director of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, was at the scene holding a placard saying 'stop facial recognition' - before she asked an officer about the man they had taken aside: 'What's your suspicion?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The officer replied: 'The fact that he's walked past clearly masking his face from recognition and covered his face. It gives us grounds to stop him and verify.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Ivan Balhatchet, the Metropolitan Police's covert and intelligence lead, said: 'We ought to explore all technology to see how it can make people safer, how it can make policing more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;mol-factbox-title&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A: How police are using facial recognition technology in London&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ins cleared mol-factbox-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Why are the police using facial recognition technology?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police hopes live facial recognition technology will help reduce crime, especially violent incidents, and could be used as a tactic to deter people from offending. They claim trialling the system in real life conditions will enable them to gather accurate data and learn as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt; the public being made aware of the trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police said it is making people aware the trial is under way with posters displayed around the affected areas. There will be a 'clear uniformed presence' of the technology, with information leaflets being handed out to members of the public. &lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Are faces stored in a database?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police said it will only keep faces matching the watch list for up to 30 days - all other data is deleted immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Can you refuse to be scanned?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;People can refuse to be scanned without being viewed as suspicious, although the Metropolitan Police said 'there must be additional information available to support such a view'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;Is this the first facial recognition trial?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Police has previously tested the system at major events, first at the Notting Hill Carnival in August 2016 and then at Remembrance Day, as well as at the Stratford transport hub. South Wales Police have also tried the technology at various events including the Champions League 2017 final in Cardiff, rugby matches and Liam Gallagher and Kasabian concerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mol-style-bold&quot;&gt;How accurate is the technology?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Trials in London and Wales have had mixed results so far. Last May, the Metropolitan Police released figures showing it had identified 102 false positives - cases where someone was incorrectly matched to a photo - with only two correct matches.  South Wales Police said its trial results improved after changes to the algorithm used to identify people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Eight people were arrested during the trial on January 31 this year, which took eight hours, but just three were a direct result of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;A 15-year-old boy identified by the recognition cameras was arrested on suspicion of robbery but released with no further action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment and a 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of breach of a molestation order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The five other arrests were two teenage boys accused of robbery, a 17-year-old boy accused of firing a gun and two men aged 25 and 46 for drug possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Speaking about the man who was fined, a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'On Thursday, January 31 officers stopped a man who was seen acting suspiciously in the area of Romford Town Centre during the deployment of the live facial recognition technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'After being stopped the man became aggressive and made threats towards officers. He was issued with a penalty notice for disorder as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'While anyone who declined to be scanned was not necessarily be viewed as suspicious, officers used their judgement to identify any potential suspicious behaviour.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Last December, a suspect was arrested by the Metropolitan Police during a trial of the facial recognition technology among Christmas shoppers at Leicester Square in London's West End.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Another man was stopped due to the technology, but found not to be the man the computer thought he was - although he was arrested over another offence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Big Brother Watch has previously said the technology is a 'breach of fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of assembly'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;They have monitored the officers and say police treat those who avoid the cameras with suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;But the police insist people can decline to be scanned without arousing suspicion and the move is necessary to crack down on spiralling violence crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;A mandate they have produced to guide officers states: 'It is right and appropriate to bring people who are unlawfully at large to justice as they may otherwise pose a threat of safety to the public through the commission of crime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;'It is less resource intensive which will save police time and money and allow police to concentrate resources on other priorities.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The Home Office has said the system can be an 'invaluable tool' in fighting crime, while the National Police Chiefs Council said it could disrupt criminals but insisted any rollout must show be effective within 'sufficient safeguards'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;The technology was first deployed by South Wales Police ahead of the 2017 Champions League final in Cardiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;That trial led to the technology wrongly matching more than 2,000 people to possible criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mol-para-with-font&quot;&gt;Police and security services worldwide are keen to use facial recognition technology to bolster their efforts to fight crime and identify suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I turned my interview task for Google into a startup</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://uxdesign.cc/i-turned-my-interview-task-for-google-into-a-startup-877943fb3b34</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1299&quot; id=&quot;1299&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Over a year ago I was lucky enough to bag an interview at Google for the role of Visual Designer. After getting through several tough rounds I was faced with the notorious Google interview task. Unfortunately for me, I didn’t get the job. Fortunately for me, all was not lost as I fell in love with the task so much I co-founded a fitness tech startup on the back of that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dbd3&quot; id=&quot;dbd3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s the story of how we built &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tona, launched today on Product Hunt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; class=&quot;graf-imageAnchor&quot; data-action=&quot;image-link&quot; data-action-observe-only=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*JSRpT9DxetR4V66mVTa4BA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2770&quot; data-height=&quot;1113&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JSRpT9DxetR4V66mVTa4BA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Interview task on the left &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tona.fit&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.tona.fit&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.tona.fit&lt;/a&gt; on the right
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3f6e&quot; id=&quot;3f6e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The dreaded interview task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84a3&quot; id=&quot;84a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The bane of all product designer’s lives is the dreaded interview task. We all know the drill: You have ‘4–6 hours’ to design a slick product, with a memorable brand and cohesive working method. No one acknowledges the fact that in reality, you’re about to dedicate up to 5 working days on this task, with the potential for them to ghost you straight afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a524&quot; id=&quot;a524&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When I interviewed at Google for the role of Visual Designer this was no exception. After two rounds of interviews later I was slapped with the infamous task. They presented three design challenge options to pick from, with a weeks notice and advised that we should spend no more that 3–5 hours on the task (wink, wink) and provide the following deliverables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;6f3a&quot; id=&quot;6f3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A low-fidelity overview of your proposed UX (wireframes or sketches are fine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;77dd&quot; id=&quot;77dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A high-fidelity mockup for one widget or interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5941&quot; id=&quot;5941&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Any materials you used to arrive at final results (paper sketches, explorations, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7983&quot; id=&quot;7983&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;To be fair to Google, they did stipulate they valued the work process and idea generation above pixel perfection. But, as a designer, I can’t help but fuss over the details. I know that great visuals capture attention and that every extra minute of work can help you get the edge over a rival candidate. And so, the late night work began…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; class=&quot;graf-imageAnchor&quot; data-action=&quot;image-link&quot; data-action-observe-only=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*0_nSXKybaQHSpQfK.png&quot; data-width=&quot;880&quot; data-height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*0_nSXKybaQHSpQfK.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
God is in the detail (interview task mockups)
&lt;h3 name=&quot;58df&quot; id=&quot;58df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4fc9&quot; id=&quot;4fc9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;One of the options was to design a Fitness Class Leaderboard, as a regular gym goer, I decided to go for it. I figured it was a chance to flex my design skills in UI and UX, with a little fun thrown in. Fit-tech had already piqued my interest, as with my friends (and future co-founders) I had spent many evenings nursing drinks and musing ideas for a gym-class booking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;38b5&quot; id=&quot;38b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In order to cut down the production time, I reused assets I’d already doodled during the class-booking app ideation. Then I duplicated the layout and web page presentation format that I’d used for previous interviews (check out my previous work for &lt;a href=&quot;https://farmer-july-85764.netlify.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://farmer-july-85764.netlify.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewburtondesign.co.uk/work/hudl/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://andrewburtondesign.co.uk/work/hudl/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hudl&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

The holiday balcony workspace. Intentionally ruffled by design…
&lt;p name=&quot;bc6a&quot; id=&quot;bc6a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I always strive to be as efficient as possible by reusing components and assets, but the dreaded interview task still got to me. I racked up 30 hours of work trying to make Google love me. All on a week in which I was also on holiday… in the South of France, I was working until 3am on a balmy balcony in the town of Nice (not the worst thing in the world, but being on the beach or in the buzzing bars would have been a hell of a lot better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84e1&quot; id=&quot;84e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I really wanted the job, I put my all in. You can check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://invester-toothpick-72166.netlify.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://invester-toothpick-72166.netlify.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;final interview submission here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; class=&quot;graf-imageAnchor&quot; data-action=&quot;image-link&quot; data-action-observe-only=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*yd001_R2uDxsyAuZYjKCtQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1396&quot; data-height=&quot;705&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yd001_R2uDxsyAuZYjKCtQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Interview task on the left and Tona as it is now. Although the brand has visibly improved, the core facets of the product are still very similar
&lt;h3 name=&quot;bc8e&quot; id=&quot;bc8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;From the interview task to a business idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;772f&quot; id=&quot;772f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Unfortunately for me, I didn’t get the job. I was told it was extremely close and that I should reapply in 12 months, but it seems my ideas weren’t out there enough to excite them… (so try and shock them, aspiring Googlers!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c46&quot; id=&quot;3c46&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This pragmatic approach was intentional however, I was already thinking ahead to how this product could sell to my local gym, or how I would use it next time I hit a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/&quot; class=&quot;graf-imageAnchor&quot; data-action=&quot;image-link&quot; data-action-observe-only=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*LPTprtuf418rdCf0Av3Fgw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2264&quot; data-height=&quot;1155&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LPTprtuf418rdCf0Av3Fgw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3947&quot; id=&quot;3947&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Whilst researching, I found there was no true platform for gym leaderboards. Ones that record and display metrics no-matter your gym. What I had in mind would record everything, from reps to distance, load to calories, seconds to rounds, max heart rates to one rep maxes. In your gym, or at home, and compare your results with friends, gym buddies and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d86&quot; id=&quot;4d86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My mind instantly went to an app I love, Strava. I use it almost daily to record my runs to share and compete with friends. But, I also enjoy strength and HIIT training in the gym. With the gym leaderboard brief, I realised there was an untapped niche to create a social fitness platform for all gym based activity. Recording and sharing reps and sets, not just your distance and pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9a6c&quot; id=&quot;9a6c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Fast forward to this week in May and we have &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; released our product Tona check it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tona&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tona&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Product Hunt today and upvote it if you like it!&lt;/a&gt; It has been one heck of a journey to get to this point. With plenty of ups, downs and mistakes along the way, of which I’m sure I could write plenty more on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c7d&quot; id=&quot;4c7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But looking back, one of the most interesting things is how similar my initial design for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://invester-toothpick-72166.netlify.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://invester-toothpick-72166.netlify.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Interview task&lt;/a&gt; was to where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/?utm_source=Medium%20Blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Medium&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Google%20Interview&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tona.fit/?utm_source=Medium%20Blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=Medium&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Google%20Interview&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we landed today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;2d86&quot; id=&quot;2d86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We have over 5,000 users planning, recording and sharing workouts from boxing to yoga, CrossFit to HIIT from Mexico to Japan, London to Los Angeles. In fact, our BETA users have burned two million calories collectively and lifted 500,000 tonnes. All of which are displayed in over a million unique leaderboards filterable by sex, age, weight and location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a2e8&quot; id=&quot;a2e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our gym solution is being trialled by 5 studios in our home town of London and we have international expansion in mind this year (if you are a gym owner, reach out to us at hello@tona.fit!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;432e&quot; id=&quot;432e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Fortunately, this interview task had a life after completion. Unfortunately, for the most part, those weeks of work never do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85e7&quot; id=&quot;85e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I hope this inspires you to treat future interview tasks, no matter your industry, as an opportunity to explore ideas beyond the first paycheck. You never know, there might be a startup in it after all...&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, as a newly minted CEO of healthcare services company called CareCentrix, I had a complicated challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link__container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;rich-link__header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;rich-link__title&quot;&gt;Disney heir on CEO's $66m pay: 'No one on the freaking planet is worth that'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our margins had declined and our revenue growth had stalled. My board of directors and my investors demanded improved performance: lower costs that would lead to more growth and more profit. At the same time, I was becoming increasingly worried about our team and our turnover numbers. We are a people business and in some divisions we were losing 30 to 40% of our teammates within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My HR staff suggested that we re-think our recruiting and training – which made sense – but I thought that we could do more. I thought we needed to reconsider how we supported and paid our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our entry level jobs – where turnover was the highest – we paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour (or less than $16,000 per year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming nothing went wrong, and assuming that our employees were living with another wage earner or working another part-time job, $7.25 hourly wage might be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that for many of us, things do go wrong, and I had emails from my new teammates to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was from a customer service representative – a young mother with a family, who had lost her apartment in a fire and did not have enough money for diapers. Another email soon followed – this employee had missed a few bills and was living out of her car with her child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drove me crazy: how did we get to the point where one of our employees had to apologetically ask for financial support so she and her family could put a roof over their heads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;A young mother did not have enough money for diapers. Another employee was living in her car with her child&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of our elected officials congratulated us for creating jobs, I felt that we were failing some of our employees, and the communities we were based in. The more our executive team parsed through the requests for assistance, the more we all became uncomfortable with the mismatch between what we asked of our employees and what we provided to them in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost no one enters the infuriatingly complicated healthcare system by choice. It might be from an accident or a chronic illness, but nearly every person who needs healthcare starts from a position of vulnerability and some fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when we hire new employees, we ask that they inject their heart in every interaction – beyond just completing a task – because although it is what every patients deserves it’s not always what they receive from the system. How could we demand that our employees focus on the unmet needs of our patients, while their employer was not looking out for their basic needs ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my concerns to my team. After many tough conversations, it became clear that we could not simply raise wages and hit our budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came back with a challenge: what if we froze the wages of the senior team and invested the annual inflation adjustment allotted for us into raising the wages of our entry-level employees ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenged the chief financial officer to see how deeply we would have to freeze wages in order to reach our goal of a base rate of $15 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was that we did not have to go very deep. Over the last few decades executive salaries have skyrocketed. That translates into accelerated wage growth in the highest tiers of executives throughout American business, and it affects every company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that meant for our company was that if we just froze the wages of our most senior team – less than 20 executives – we could radically increase the wages and improve the lives of nearly 500 of our teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation with our executives was straightforward. We were in the midst of a turnaround. We were demanding much from every corner of the company. Small financial sacrifices from those at the top could be life changing for those at the bottom of our wage scale. We needed to do it to build a real sense of Team CareCentrix. They agreed. With joy, we announced in January 2015 that our minimum base pay for employees would go up to $34,000, or the equivalent of $15 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising wages in the midst of a business turnaround was not easy. We needed our executive team to buy into a vision of business success where every employee had a fair shot at success. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our business has tripled over the past five years. Our minimum wage is now approaching $16.50 per hour and last year we broadened profit sharing to all levels of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I share my story at CareCentrix so that politicians and the public remember the role and responsibility of the business community in contributing to the success of the American Dream, and so that business leaders understand that an investment in the workforce is one of the best financial decisions to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business has its unique challenge, but the example of CareCentrix suggests that there is plenty wealth to go around – at the very least, to make sure that the employees we ask so much of can live a healthy and fulfilling life with the wages we pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to serving as CEO of CareCentrix, John Driscoll is a member of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of high-net worth business leaders and investors who are united in their concern about the destabilizing concentration of wealth and power in America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Hi all, I have opened a new forum after the old was closed by the provider. Unfortunately it was not possible to move all the content of the old forum to the new one. But I have copied the most important topics &quot;by hand&quot;, so not all is lost. Now it's on you to fill the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.forumprofi.de&quot;&gt;new forum&lt;/a&gt; with content!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5.2136752136752&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;90&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018-06-17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dear community, I was informed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysnip.de/&quot;&gt;provider that hosts the MyCPU forum&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.foren.mysnip.de/&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; will be closed until 2018-08-31. I am now looking for a new free forum hosting side that we can use for our project. The website should preferably use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phorum.org/&quot;&gt;Phorum&lt;/a&gt; as software since this would simplify the transfer of the content of the old forum very much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;6.4494382022472&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;90&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016-10-07&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It got a bit silent around MyCPU. This is mainly caused by my two children (twins, 16 months old), who are consuming all my free time. But in the few free minutes that remain I am still working on MyCPU. My current project is again a pure software project that I call &quot;vCPU&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/vcpu.htm&quot;&gt;vCPU is a virtual 16-bit CPU&lt;/a&gt; that gets emulated in software by MyCPU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5.7966101694915&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;90&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016-09-03&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Because I am not willing to update all my PCs to Windows 10, I have now changed to the free Linux OS (Arch Linux). For this reason I have ported all MyCPU cross-platform-tools to Linux. The remote file server (rfss) compiles now on the latest Linux versions and supports all available serial communication devices. The MyCPU Emulator works great under Linux and feels much more realistic than the MS Windows version. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/guides-e.htm&quot;&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt; to get the files!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mycpu.thtec.org/downloads/MyCPU23_Introduction.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/pictures/pic_cpucomp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;710&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; alt=&quot;MyCPU Computer System. Click to read more.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the electronics above on a single &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/mycpucompact.htm&quot;&gt;FPGA board:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/mycpucompact.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/pictures/pic_mycpucf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;710&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; alt=&quot;MyCPU Compact&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/en.gif&quot; width=&quot;18&quot; height=&quot;12&quot;/&gt;  The MyCPU is a &quot;Central Processing Unit&quot; that is completely built with discrete logic gates. Over the years the project has grown, and now the MyCPU is the brain of a real Personal Computer. The computer has the following capabilities and features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All is built with 74HCxxx circuits. No higher integrated parts are use (except the EPROMs, RAMs and UARTs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system runs with up to 8 MHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;available hardware: 8 Bit CPU at 8 MHz (the &quot;MyCPU&quot;), 1.03 MB RAM / 128 KB ROM, Interrupt Controller, Multi-I/O with 2 serial ports, 1 printer port, LCD and PS/2-Keyboard interface, IDE-Controller for 4 harddisks, VGA graphic card, Ethernet Controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;available software: DOS-like operating system, games, disk tools, programming tools, TCP/IP-stack, web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The computer can be programmed in basic, assembler and &quot;C&quot;. The basic-interpreter is integrated into the operating system, and the assembler is an executable that is loaded from disk and translates the assembly syntax into binary code on the MyCPU. The C-Compiler is a cross-compiler that runs on a Windows or Linux based host system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The realtime operating system &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picoos.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;pico]OS&lt;/a&gt;&quot; has been ported to the MyCPU. Applications for &lt;a href=&quot;http://picoos.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;pico]OS&lt;/a&gt; can be written in &quot;C&quot;. This is a good starting point for education purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have ported &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/contiki.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;Contiki&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to MyCPU. Contiki is a network enabled window application, that comes with widgets like a web browser and a FTP client. You can surf in the internet with MyCPU!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project is totally open source. Please contact me if you are missing something like schematics, software or descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You want to know more about MyCPU? Please &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/epj03.htm&quot;&gt;read this article!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the project, you may now&lt;/p&gt;

The original interpreter is small (less than 512 bytes), uses simple instructions and is easy to program. The early games like Pong, Brix and Tank fit in less than 256 bytes program code. The chip8-Interpreter for MyCPU can also execute SCHIP programs. SCHIP is an extension to CHIP-8 and was written in 1990 for the HP48 graphing calculator. The MyCPU software package contains about 30 games, including the well known Space Invaders game, Blinky (a Pac-Man clone), Brix, Joust, Sokoban, Tetris and others.&lt;br/&gt;To run the chip8 interpreter, download the latest MyCPU emulator (at least revision 7) and enter &quot;chip8&quot; at the prompt. Please note that you need Kernel version 2.21 or higher on your MyCPU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Contiki is a window based operating system for computers (or embedded systems) that have only very little memory. I have ported Contiki to MyCPU with the goal to have access to various Contiki applications. Porting the Contiki core to MyCPU was very hard work, but know it is very simple to compile the applications, since the user API is completely transparent to the applications. Most Contiki applications run without modifications on MyCPU! One really nice application is the internet web browser (see the picture on the right). I did some improvements on the app and now the browser is a really usable program.&lt;br/&gt;Contiki can be controlled by a computer mouse. The red dot in the picture is the mouse cursor. The mouse hovers over the yellow highlighted link, the link target is shown in the status line at the bottom.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/contiki.htm&quot;&gt;Read more about Contiki on MyCPU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Das Projekt ist immer weiter gewachsen, und mittlerweile ist aus dem CPU-Projekt ein ganzer Computer entstanden. Der Computer hat die folgenden Eigenschaften:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Er besteht überwiegend aus Bausteinen der 74er TTL-Serie. Keine hochintegrierten Bauteile wurden benutzt (außer der EPROMs, RAMs und UARTs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Computer läuft mit maximal 8 MHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;verfügbare Hardware: 8 Bit CPU mit 8 MHz (die &quot;MyCPU&quot;), 1.03 MB RAM / 128 KB ROM, Interrupt Controller, Multi-I/O mit zwei seriellen Schnittstellen und einem parallelen Drucker-Port, LCD und PS2-Tastatur-Anschluß, IDE-Controller für 4 Festplatten, VGA Grafikkarte und Ethernet Controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;verfügbare Software: DOS-artiges Betriebssystem, Spiele, DOS-Tools, Pragrammierer-Tools, TCP/IP-Stack, Webserver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Computer kann in Basic, Assembler oder in &quot;C&quot; programmiert werden. Der Basic-Interpreter ist in das Betriebssystem integriert. Der Assembler wird von der Festplatte nachgeladen und übersetzt Assembler-Quelltexte in binären Code. Der C-Compiler ist ein Cross-Compiler, der auf einem Windows- oder Linux-basierten Gastsystem läuft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das Echtzeitbetriebssystem &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picoos.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;pico]OS&lt;/a&gt;&quot; wurde auf die MyCPU portiert. Anwendungen für &lt;a href=&quot;http://picoos.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;pico]OS&lt;/a&gt; können in &quot;C&quot; geschrieben werden. Dies ist ein gute Einstieg für Bildung und Lehre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ich habe die Fenster-Applikation &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycpu.thtec.org/www-mycpu-eu/contiki.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;Contiki&quot;&lt;/a&gt; auf die MyCPU portiert. Jetzt läuft sogar ein Webbrowser auf der MyCPU, so dass man mit der MyCPU im Internet surfen und Dateien herunterladen kann.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Das Projekt ist komplett Open Source, alles was zum Nachbau benötigt wird, ist hier auf meiner Seite erhältlich. Solltest du doch etwas vermissen, dann schreib mir bitte eine email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wenn du an dem Projekt interessiert bist, kannst du nun&lt;/p&gt;

A través de los años el proyecto ha crecido, y hoy MyCPU es el corazón de una PC real. El ordenador tiene las siguientes características:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Esta construida a partir de circuitos integrados de la serie 74HCxxx. No hay otros componentes integrados (a excepción de EPROMs, RAMs y UARTs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El sistema corre hasta 8 MHz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware disponible: CPU de 8 MHz (&quot;MyCPU&quot;), 1.03 MB de RAM y 128 KB de ROM, controlador de Interrupciones, Multi E/S con dos puertos seriales, un paralelo, LCD e interfaz PS/2 para teclado, controladora IDE para cuatro discos duros y una tarjeta gráfica VGA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software disponible: Sistema operativo tipo DOS, juegos, herramientas de disco, herramientas de programación, pila TCP/IP, servidor web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El ordenador puede programarse en BASIC, Assembler y C. El interprete BASIC está integrado en el sistema operativo, y el Assembler es un ejecutable que se carga desde el disco y traduce las instrucciones al código binario de MyCPU. C es un crosscompiler que ejecuta en un host, bajo Windows o Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El sistema operativo de tiempo real &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picoos.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;pico]OS&lt;/a&gt;&quot; ha sido portado a MyCPU. Las aplicaciones para &lt;a href=&quot;http://picoos.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;pico]OS&lt;/a&gt; deben ser escritas en C. Es un buen punto de arranque para estudiantes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El proyecto es completamente open source. Por favor contácteme si no entiende alguno de los esquemas, software o descripciones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Si esta interesado en el proyecto, puede:&lt;/p&gt;

It can emulate a commercial part, that′s OK. But actually using that commercial CPU doesn′t rate. Likewise, the project must have been at least partially built: pure paper designs don′t rate either. It can be built using any technology you like, from relays to FPGAs. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

<title>U.S. blacklists Huawei</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-blacklists-chinas-huawei-as-trade-dispute-clouds-global-outlook-idUSKCN1SL2DI</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-blacklists-chinas-huawei-as-trade-dispute-clouds-global-outlook-idUSKCN1SL2DI</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration hit Chinese telecoms giant Huawei with severe sanctions on Wednesday, adding another incendiary element to the U.S.-China trade dispute just as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would visit China soon for more talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department said it was adding Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 70 affiliates to its “Entity List” - a move that bans the company from acquiring components and technology from U.S. firms without government approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that President Donald Trump backed the decision to “prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump earlier in the day signed an executive order barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms deemed to pose a national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the order did not specifically name any country or company, U.S. officials have previously labeled Huawei a “threat” and lobbied allies not to use Huawei network equipment in next-generation 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei, which denies its products pose a security threat, said it was “ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said restricting Huawei from doing business in the United States would “limit the U.S. to inferior yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the U.S. lagging behind in 5G deployment and eventually harming the interests of U.S. companies and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, Mnuchin characterized two days of high-level talks with Chinese officials in Washington last week as constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My expectation is that we will go to Beijing at some point in the near future to continue those discussions,” he said. “There’s still a lot of work to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not say when his China trip might take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in Huawei suppliers in China skidded on the news as markets opened in Asia, with Luxshare Precision Industry down as much as 6.1%. Shares in smaller Chinese Huawei rival ZTE Corp also tumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s rhetoric toward China had cooled in recent days after another round of tit-for-tat tariffs between the world’s two largest economies and a selloff on global stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Trump denied talks with China had collapsed and sounded an optimistic note about the chance of a deal, saying he had an “extraordinary” relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he plans to meet at a G20 summit in Japan next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump also urged China to buy more U.S. farm products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. agricultural goods have been targeted by China’s retaliatory tariffs, and American farmers, a key political constituency for Trump, are worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture has paid $8.52 billion directly to farmers as part of a 2018 aid program designed to offset losses from tariffs imposed by China and other trading partners, a spokesman for the agency said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration had pledged up to $12 billion in aid to help offset losses resulting from Chinese tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TARIFF PAIN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump, who has embraced protectionism as part of an “America First” agenda, has railed against what many U.S. and European officials and companies describe as China’s unfair trade practices, including forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But trading partners and close allies in Europe, North America and Asia are also in the U.S. administration’s sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mnuchin said the United States was close to resolving a dispute over steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on Canada and Mexico last year as the three countries renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer met with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the tariffs and other issues related to the U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three countries have not yet ratified the new deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her meeting with Lighthizer, Freeland declined to say whether the two countries were close to a deal. But she told reporters later that ratification of the agreement would be difficult as long as the tariffs remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to Canada it has still been the case for us that as long as the tariffs remain in place ratification would be very, very problematic,” she said on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Seade, Mexican deputy foreign minister for North America, told Reuters on Wednesday that Mexico was close to resolving its part in the tariffs dispute but wanted Canada to be in a similar position before completing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Trump administration officials told Reuters that Trump was expected to delay a decision on imposing tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months, avoiding opening yet another front in his global trade battles. The decision to delay was expected to be made on Friday, officials and automakers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tariffs of up to 25 percent on cars and parts could have a devastating impact on Japan and countries in the European Union, particularly Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stock markets, which have swooned in the past week over the rising trade tensions, gained ground on Wednesday after the reports of the planned delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;‘ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As negotiations toward resolving the U.S.-China dispute stalled last week, the United States ratcheted up the pressure by increasing tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China retaliated on Monday with higher tariffs on a revised list of $60 billion worth of U.S. products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump could launch 25% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods when he meets Xi next month. He has not ruled out imposing punitive levies on all of China’s imports to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another escalation could disrupt global supply lines and damage a slowing world economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing is vowing not to succumb to U.S. pressure. But on Wednesday, China reported surprisingly weaker growth in its retail sales and industrial output in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data out of the United States showed U.S. retail sales fell in April as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and other goods, pointing to a slowdown in economic growth after a boost from exports and inventories in the first quarter. Other data showed a drop in U.S. industrial production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress is uneasy about the potential consequences of tariffs on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said U.S. consumers were in the “same boat as farmers” and would end up having to bear the burden of the tariffs. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Close to 735k Fraudulently Obtained IP Addresses Uncovered and Revoked</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.circleid.com/posts/20190514_735k_fraudulently_obtained_ip_addresses_have_been_revoked/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/11888.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/images/uploads/11888.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Registry for Internet Numbers, Ltd. (ARIN) has won a legal case&lt;/strong&gt; against an elaborate multi-year scheme to defraud the Internet community of approximately 735,000 IPv4 addresses, the organization has revealed. While the specifics of the findings are not released, John Curran, ARIN President and CEO said the fraud was detected as a result of an internal due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARIN is a nonprofit member-based organization responsible for distributing Internet number resources in the US, Canada, and parts of the Caribbean. The emerging IPv4 address transfer market and increasing demand have resulted in more attempts to obtain IPv4 addresses fraudulently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;This is the first arbitration ever&lt;/strong&gt; brought under an ARIN Registration Services Agreement, and related proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. ARIN was able to prove an intricate scheme to fraudulently obtained resources that included many falsely notarized officer attestations sent to ARIN. &quot;A company in South Carolina obtained and utilized 11 shelf companies across the United States, and intentionally created false aliases purporting to be officers of those companies, to induce ARIN into issuing the fraudulently sought IPv4 resources and approving related transfers and reassignments of these addresses. The defrauding party was monetizing the assets obtained in the transfer market, and obtained resources under ARIN's waiting list process.&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://teamarin.net/2019/05/13/taking-a-hard-line-on-fraud/&quot;&gt;ARIN Press Release&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;The defrauding entity adopted an aggressive posture&lt;/strong&gt; after ARIN requested that it produce certain documents and explain its conduct. The suspected party filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction against ARIN in U.S. District Court, and demanded a hearing the following morning (the Friday just before Christmas). &quot;The aggressive posture was taken after ARIN indicated its intent to revoke addresses, while permitting defrauding entity to renumber to allow existing bona fide customers not to have service interrupted,&quot; ARIN’s General Counsel told CircleID. &quot;The litigation was filed against ARIN to seek an injunction to stop ARIN from revoking and enter arbitration. Some addresses were transferred for money prior to that demand, others were pending transfer and were never transferred due to ARIN investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Some fraudulently obtained addresses were transferred to third parties;&lt;/strong&gt; however ARIN made no effort to pursue the parties that received the completed transfer, ARIN’s General Counsel told CircleID. The reason being: &quot;(a) addressed were in another RIR service region (e.g. RIPE NCC and APNIC) and (b) ARIN did not see any evidence they knew of or participated in the fraud. In other words, they appeared to be bona fide 3rd parties.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;ARIN obtained the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arin.net/vault/about_us/corp_docs/20190506_arbitration_award_and_order.pdf&quot;&gt;arbitration award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on May 1, 2019, which included revocation of all resources issued pursuant to fraud and $350,000 to ARIN for its legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE May 15, 2019:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Charleston Man and Business Indicted in Federal Court in Over $9M Fraud&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; – United States Department of Justice issues a statement annoucing Amir Golestan, 36, of Charleston, and Micfo, LLC, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circleid.com/pdf/golstan_indict_filed_20190515.pdf&quot;&gt;were charged in federal court&lt;/a&gt; in a twenty-count indictment. The indictment charges twenty counts of wire fraud, with each count punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21.912698412698&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The indictment alleges that since February 2014, Golestan and Micfo created and utilized 'Channel Partners,' which purported to consist of several individual businesses, all of whom acquired the right to IP addresses from the American Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN). The indictment alleges that Golestan and Micfo fabricated the true nature of the Channel Partners, including creating false officers and deceptive websites for the businesses, which were in turn used to deceive ARIN and to fraudulently obtain IP address rights from ARIN. The indictment charges that, through this scheme, Golestan and Micfo obtained the rights to approximately 757,760 IP addresses, with a market value between $9,850,880.00 and $14,397,440.00.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/charleston-man-and-business-indicted-federal-court-over-9m-fraud&quot;&gt;DOJ&lt;/a&gt; / May 15, 2019)&lt;/p&gt;
