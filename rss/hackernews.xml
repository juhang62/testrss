<title>An Unlikely Database Migration</title>
<link>https://tailscale.com/blog/an-unlikely-database-migration/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tailscale.com/blog/an-unlikely-database-migration/</guid>
<description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;brad-joins-a-startup&quot;&gt;Brad joins a startup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://tailscale.com/&quot;&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt; almost a year ago, one of the first things I asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/crawshaw&quot;&gt;Crawshaw&lt;/a&gt; was, “So, what database do you use? MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite maybe?”, knowing that he loved SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A text file,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Huh?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, we write out one big JSON object to a text file.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How? When? &lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, whenever something changes, we grab a lock in our single process and rewrite out the file!” he chuckled with glee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounded insane. It &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; insane. Sure, it was easily testable, but it didn’t scale. We both knew that. But it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with fast NVMe drives and splitting the database into two halves (important data vs. ephemeral data that we could lose on a tmpfs), things got slower and slower. We knew the day would come. The file reached a peak size of 150MB and we were writing it as quickly as the disk I/O would let us. Ain’t that just peachy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, migrate to MySQL or PostgreSQL, right? Maybe SQLite?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, Crawshaw had other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-bit-of-backstory-from-david&quot;&gt;A bit of backstory from David&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailscale’s coordination server, our “control plane”, has become known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://getsmart.fandom.com/wiki/CONTROL&quot;&gt;CONTROL&lt;/a&gt;. It’s currently a single Go process on a single VM. The very earliest prototypes for CONTROL used SQLite. Our original designs were very different from what we ended up with, involving configuration databases synchronized onto client machines and all sorts of other concepts we ended up not needing. Through this process we would do major reorganizations of our SQL data model every week, which required an astonishing amount of typing. SQL is widely used, durable, effective, and requires an annoying amount of glue to bring into just about any programming language. (Attempts to avoid this with ORMs usually replace an annoying amount of typing with an annoying amount of magic and loss of efficiency.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, fed up with the refactorings, I threw it all out and built an in-memory data model for experimentation. That made iterating much faster. A couple of weeks later, a customer wanted to try it out. I wasn’t ready to commit to the data model yet and do it properly in SQL, so I took a shortcut: the object holding all the data was wrapped in a sync.Mutex, all accesses went through it, and on edit the whole structure was passed to &lt;code&gt;json.Marshal&lt;/code&gt; and written to disk. This gave us data model persistence in ~20 lines of Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was always to migrate to something else but, uh, we got busy with other stuff and kinda forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-comes-after-jsonmutexdb&quot;&gt;What comes after JSONMutexDB?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious next step to take was to move to SQL. My favorite is still SQLite, but I couldn’t bring myself to make an argument for migrating a rapidly growing service to it. It certainly could work, especially as the design of our control plane doesn’t require the high availability of typical web services: the result of a short outage is that new nodes can’t log in; working networks continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MySQL (or PostgreSQL) would come next. I’m not particularly familiar with anything MySQL post 1998, but I’m sure it would work. The HA story for open source databases is somewhat surprising, though: you can either have traditional lagging replicas, or commit to no-primary-replica clusters that have very surprising transaction semantics. I wasn’t excited about trying to design a stable API or good network graph calculations on top of those semantics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach#what-is-cockroachdb&quot;&gt;CockroachDB&lt;/a&gt; looked very promising, and indeed still does! But it’s relatively new for a database and I was a little concerned about getting attached to features in a fresh DBMS that would be hard to migrate away from if we needed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making our control server depend on MySQL or PostgreSQL also means our control server’s testing story gets slow &amp;amp; ugly. Brad had fought that battle with &lt;a href=&quot;https://perkeep.org%5D&quot;&gt;Perkeep&lt;/a&gt; and previously written &lt;a href=&quot;https://godoc.org/perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest&quot;&gt;perkeep.org/pkg/test/dockertest&lt;/a&gt; which works but isn’t something we wanted to subject future employees to. It requires Docker on your machine and it’s not particularly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day we saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jepsen.io/analyses/etcd-3.4.3&quot;&gt;Jepsen report on etcd&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the usual less-than-satisfying Jepsen reports to which we’d become accustomed, this one said &lt;em&gt;good things&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://etcd.io/&quot;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt;. Combined with some positive experiences &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danderson&quot;&gt;Dave Anderson&lt;/a&gt; had with it, we started thinking about whether we could just use etcd directly. Being written in Go, we could just link it into our tests and use it directly. No Docker, no mocks, testing what we’d actually use in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the core data model we were writing to disk closely followed the pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;type AllTheData struct {
        BigLock    sync.Mutex
        Somethings map[string]Something
        Widgets    map[string]Widget
        Gadgets    map[string]Gadget
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This maps surprisingly well onto a KV-store. So this led us to etcd as a “minimally-viable database”. It does the critical things we needed now, which was 1) breaking the BigLock into something more akin to a &lt;code&gt;sync.RWMutex&lt;/code&gt;, and 2) reducing our I/O to only write the changed data, not the whole world on any write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We are careful not to use any etcd features that would be hard to map onto CockroachDB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of this is that etcd, while popular in Kubernetes, has relatively few users for a database system. As a company, Tailscale is spending an &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology&quot;&gt;innovation token&lt;/a&gt; on it. But the database is conceptually small enough that we don’t have to treat it as a black box. When we ran into a surprisingly slow key pagination edge case in etcd 3.4, I was able to read my way through its sources and write a fix for it in an hour. (I then discovered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/26c930f27d46776da5fedae69267ba0b69c31185&quot;&gt;equivalent fix&lt;/a&gt; had already been applied to the next version of etcd, so we backported that instead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;tailetc-our-etcd-client-wrapper&quot;&gt;tailetc: our etcd client wrapper&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client we use for etcd is open source at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc&quot;&gt;github.com/tailscale/tailetc&lt;/a&gt;. It is built around two concepts: 1) the total data in the DB is small enough to fit into the server’s memory and 2) reads are far more common than writes. Given that, we want to make reads cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we do that is by registering a watch against etcd. Every change is sent to the client, which maintains an enormous cache &lt;code&gt;map[string]interface{}&lt;/code&gt; behind a &lt;code&gt;sync.RWMutex&lt;/code&gt;. When you create a Tx and do a Get, the value is read out of this cache (which may be behind etcd, but is kept transactionally consistent by tracking the modrev: a global incrementing ID that etcd uses to define revisions of key-value pairs.). To avoid aliasing bugs with the cache, we copy the object out, but avoid JSON decoding on each Get by implementing a more efficient Clone call on objects in the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that fetching a value from etcd does not require any network traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those few times writing Go that I felt the limitations of its type system as I was designing a package. If I were working in a language with all the bells and whistles, there would be some kind of const qualifier I could place on objects leaving the cache and avoid cloning the memory. That said, running profiles on our server show the copying is not a performance issue, so perhaps this is an example of where I feel the pull towards a more complex type system without actually having a real need for them. As is so often the case, assumptions are dangerous, profiling is enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;one-snag-indexes&quot;&gt;One snag: indexes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with choosing a minimal viable “nosql” is the lack of the wonderful index system every standard SQL DBMS supplies. We are stuck with either storing indexes inside etcd, or managing them in memory in our client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With JSONMutexDB we generated them in memory, because it’s much easier to make data model changes. The easy option with etcd would have been writing them to the database, but that would have really complicated data models. Unfortunately, if we want to move to running more than one CONTROL process simultaneously for high-availability and better release management, that means we no longer have exactly one process managing the data, so our indexes need to be transaction (and rollback) aware. So we invested what probably amounts to two or three weeks of engineering time into designing in-memory indexes that are transactionally consistent. This gets a bit tricky to describe, so we’ll save that for a future blog post (and hopefully we can clean up the code enough to open source it some day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-migration&quot;&gt;The migration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration wasn’t very notable, which is always a good thing. We ran both systems in parallel for a while and at some point stopped using the old one. The most exciting thing was that our commit latency dropped a bunch when we turned off the JSON writes. This was most noticeable when editing networks in the admin panel. We’d include pretty Grafana graphs here but the cut-over predates us changing our Prometheus config to keep more history. In any case, writes went from nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds. When we’d started, writes weren’t a second of course. Never underestimate how long your “temporary” hack will stay in production!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;future&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most exciting thing about this work, besides ensuring the Tailscale control plane can scale out for the foreseeable future, is improving our release process. A consistent database we can easily attach multiple control plane instances to means we can move to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment&quot;&gt;blue-green deployment&lt;/a&gt;. This will let Tailscale engineers experiment with deploying features with the confidence that the worst-case outcome of a change is limited. The goal is to keep development speed as close to the early days of JSONMutexDB, when you could recompile and run locally in a fraction of a second and deploy ten times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; The American Civil Liberties Union announced Tuesday that Open Whisper Systems (OWS), the company behind popular encrypted messaging app Signal, was subpoenaed earlier this year by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia to hand over a slew of information—&quot;subscriber name, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, method of payment&quot;—on two of its users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; ... “The only information responsive to the subpoena held by OWS is the time of account creation and the date of the last connection to Signal servers,” Kaufman continued, also pointing out that the company did in fact hand over this data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Yes, it's not strong proof, but it should be taken into account when comparing the goals and motivations of organizations developing various other communicators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The organization behind your communicator app could be in the business of gathering data about you and selling it in various forms (Facebook, Google), in the business of selling hardware and add-on software services (Apple), or in the non-business of trying to provide you with private communications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The Signal app itself is opensource as well various pieces of the tech stack. You can audit yourself what is being sent and how their protocols work. The protocol itself has won awards due to its security and elegance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There is a lot of good things to say about Signal and you can easily find it all. They have made some annoying or less than ideal features that are opt-out instead of opt-in but they're not sacrificing privacy for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Your phone is running an APK, which is a bunch of signed code. You don't have the keys to sign such an APK yourself, but you can get tools that will tell you exactly what's inside the one you have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I believe the Java source in GitHub is designed to be capable of a reproducible build, where you get the exact same Java binaries out as Signal's own builders did and thus you can compare that to confirm the Java code in your APK matches a specific Git checkout.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The media files (e.g. images, labels) are just straight binary copies so that's easy enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;However there is native code to make stuff like video calls work, and when I last paid attention there was no reproducible build for that component. So you could imagine that somehow the native video call code is actually a secret backdoor or something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Still, years ahead anything else that actually have users. The server is mostly 100% closed source. There's one open source that you can host, but it's widely believed to not be even close to the one they use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; should be taken into account when comparing the goals and motivations of organizations developing various other communicators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Business or funding models can change for both for- and non-profit organizations. Especially as people move to options that are believed to have better user-privacy, the idea that they do not sell/monetize collected user data today does not indicate what they will do tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Unless users have strong evidence that companies are not collecting and/or monetizing this information (which as the OP pointed out, there is for Signal as found in a subpoena), the &quot;billboard&quot; approach towards promising user privacy via marketing and PR is a shallow one at best for non-profits as well as for-profit companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Signal may have only supplied that metadata at the time. But what I am concerned about is that if Signal is US-based, couldn’t the state demand Signal’s app signing key via a NSL, and couldn’t that signing key then be used for targeted attacks by which someone of interest gets a Signal app upgrade that is malicious (while everyone else gets the non-malicious app)? I admit to being somewhat unfamiliar with Android distribution through the Play Store, so if this is unfeasible, help me understand why.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Yes. But if you specifically are targeted by organisations capable of issuing NSLs, you're completely hosed already. (And they're just as likely, if not more so, to have done that to your OS instead of just the Signal app.)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;25769562&quot; readability=&quot;6.5510688836105&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Technically they could get the signature key, but they can't force Signal to publish it via the store. Users would have to download an .apk file and install it directly. At that point there is no reason to have the signing key at all as the phone will recognize a sideload as a third party install. As far as I know, the government cannot compel a company to do something like update an app.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Is there not a suspicion that Google, another US-based corporation, may have some agreement with American national security to supply malicious APKs to individual targets via the Play Store? Having Signal’s signing key would allow the state to present that custom-targeted APK as an ordinary Signal version update.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So if you're under the assumption that they don't, this is incorrect.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Telegram, for all intents and purposes, is about as secure as using Facebook. The best you can do with Telegram is hope they don't sell out or get compromised at some point in the future, because all your private communications are stored on their servers forever. Telegram does have &quot;secret chats&quot;, which from what I can gather, don't even work for group chats, only one-to-one messages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My general advice is to treat Telegram like a new Facebook if you have to use it, assume everything may by read by everyone, don't treat it like it's private and secure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For &quot;text messaging&quot; friends and family use Signal. Everything is end-to-end encrypted by default, so you know nobody is collecting your data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And yes, obviously Signal is more secure than both of them but I've been steering non-techies to Telegram because of usability, backups, cross-device history etc. As usual, everything is a tradeoff, but if people were happily using WhatsApp up until now, and also use Gmail, Telegram is not worse than those.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But what I do like about Telegram is their good user experience and Bot API developer experience. It's soooooooooo fucking good I'm telling you. It just works, be it on web, mobile, and desktop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At this point who the fuck knows if Durov can be trusted (hell we all wish, right, no harm in that). But regardless of that, at the end of the day I'd be willing to admit he's a fucking genius when it comes to Telegram's UX and DX.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's a threat model decision. If you're someone who wants privacy from the US or other Western governments (think Antifa on the left side, or corona-deniers, qanons and other conspiracy nuts on the right side), Telegram is the best option since the Western governments can't hold them accountable. If you're a Russian or Chinese dissident, or opposition in countries aligned with them (e.g. Serbia) Whatsapp and Facebook are your best bet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;What we do know is that programs like Telegram &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; store data about users on their servers, by design. A big difference between the two projects is that Signal is carefully designed to minimize the amount of data the service needs to operate; it's why identifiers are phone numbers --- so it can piggyback on your already-existing contact lists, which are kept on your phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Yes. Ultimately we have no choice but to trust trust itself.[a] That said, if the OP were a non-technical friend asking me the same question, I would respond more or less like this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&quot;Of all the widely used messaging services, Signal is the only one known to be designed to minimize the amount of user data needed to operate, and all indications are that they are operating as designed[b], so Signal is likely your best choice today if privacy is your main concern.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;On the contrary, if you answer the same to WhatsApp, it plain refuses to work. But it actually created an account on their servers, and from that on you appear on your contacts who do use WhatsApp as another user of WhatsApp, which invites them to write to you there although you cannot receive their messages. To fix this, you have to find the option in WhatsApp to delete your account.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And it is convenient, because you can just switch your smartphone and still access all your chathistory, without having to manually backup/restore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But Telegram in general does not have a business model yet, so just assume, that one day, they want(or have) to cash out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Signal on the other hand is a non-profit foundation and pretty open on what they are doing. That creates trust for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1. the protocol between client and server is setup in such a way, even if Signal wanted to store interesting information, they could not access anything interesting even if they wanted to (for example, messages), thus they don't store anything since it's useless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;2. the app implements the protocol faithfully and this has been checked by people perusing the source code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;3. the binary downloaded from the app/play store phone is compiled from the sources listed on github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is mentioned elsewhere, but the answer is: reproducible builds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You can take the Signal client source (which is available on Github), build an APK or whatnot yourself, then get the SHA256 hash or whatever and compare that to the artifact downloaded from the app store and validate that it's the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What you do is use a special iPhone (a Security Research Device) that Apple grants some researchers or you use an emulator like the one from Corellium (to whom Apple recently lost a lawsuit over this emulator) to probe and step through the code. Find the key sections that do the real crypto work and make sure that they do what they are supposed to do and that they are getting the correct inputs.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There is a large group of people who do this sort of research, and some fraction of them do this research and actually talk about it or publish papers. If you could find a deliberate weakness in the security of an app like what we are talking about (or WhatsApp or iMessages) then you have just printed your own golden ticket to whatever mobile cybersecurity job you want for the next decade or two, so there is a bit of an incentive to publish if something like this was discovered...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If the NSA did have it backdoored somehow through the OS, it's a good bet they'd force LE agencies to use parallel construction to keep that information top secret.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;11.933035714286&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;We've got certificate authorities to centralize trust for server public keys. And those require trusting organizations that lots of people don't want to trust. We don't have an equivalent system for individuals. There is no trivial push-button key verification process for peer-to-peer communications. Key signing parties suck and never worked. Key validation for things like Signal is nicely automated if you are physically near the other person. But beyond that it is tricky.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It is hard enough to get my parents to use a secure messenger. If I told them they needed to do a key verification process for every person they ever communicate with... they'd just go back to facebook messenger or sms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think it is completely reasonable for somebody to say &quot;I don't care enough to worry about validating public keys&quot; while also educating people like journalists about how to do that correctly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Signal does have the capability to have a verification phrase displayed, which is generated from the session key. Reading that off can make the video more difficult to MITM, because then they'd have to morph the audio to match the phrase, and if it's done after the video is setup, morph the video as well. Not impossible, but difficult.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is false. A video call will not prevent or detect MITM. You may be suggesting that a video call is used to authenticate the key, which is certainly a step in the right direction, but I don't think Signal supports this.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This uses the fact that the client on each side is open source and inspectable, so that each side knows that they sent only the public key that they generated on their own device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Indeed it is far from straightforward that merely doing a video call suffices to check the keys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Signal is famously using a special protocol for secure key sharing through the server, which I have not studied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But as said by another comment, there is no way around verifying explicitly the public key using an independent channel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The reason they don't store the data is because it would be pointless. The Github repos contain the device source code which, for most platforms, can be verified.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If the main danger is, police scanning the phone for compromised material (without a police spyware on it), then there are some ways to deal with it technically, by using services that don't leave a trace. Telegram for example has a &quot;secret chat&quot; function, which won't save the messages, meaning someone scanning your phone later, won't find them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(which I head is also a main reason for many people to join telegram, because so they can chat with their affairs and not have their wifes read it)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Then there are simply private tabs of chrome or ff, from where you can use chat-services without trace. (if the chat services are not cooperating with the police, or are decentralised by default, I think in that scenario I would use matrix)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Anyway, you live in kashmir?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I know mainly of the conflict by reading Shalimar the Clown, from Rushdie. Just curious about your opinion, if you know the book. I heard it was not well received in Kashmir itself? I think it was very well written, but I don't know how accurate it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Workaholism Leads to Mental and Physical Health Problems: Work Addiction Risk Depends on Occupation&quot; src=&quot;https://www.hse.ru/data/2021/01/13/1347222870/iStock-1180554582.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Workaholism Leads to Mental and Physical Health Problems: Work Addiction Risk Depends on Occupation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;with-indent5 _builder builder--text&quot; readability=&quot;40.355723746452&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lead-in&quot;&gt;Workaholism or work addiction risk is a growing public health concern that can lead to many negative mental and physical health outcomes such as depression, anxiety or sleep disorder. Perception of work (job demands and job control) may become a major cause of employees’ work addiction. The international group of researchers including the HSE University scientist explored the link between work addiction risk and health-related outcomes using the framework of Job Demand Control Model. The results were published in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7593928/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workaholics are people who usually work seven and more hours more than others per week. There are potential reasons for that: financial problems, poor marriage or pressure by their organization or supervisor. What can differentiate a workaholic behaviour from similar behaviour like work engagement? Workaholism is also known as a behavioural disorder, which means the excessive involvement of the individual in work when an employer doesn’t require or expect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;incut&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists aimed to demonstrate the extent to which the work addiction risk is associated with the perception of work (job demands and job control), and mental health in four job categories suggested by Karasek’s model or Job Demand-Control-Support model (JDCS). The JDCS model assumes four various work environments (four quadrants) in which workers may experience a different level of job demands and job control: passive, low-strain, active, and tense/job-strain. Job control is the extent to which an employee feels control over doing work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;with-indent5 _builder builder--text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;icons&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;icon ion-battery-full&quot;&gt;Passive” jobs (low job control, low job demands) might be satisfying to a worker as long as the workers reach the set goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;icon ion-battery-half&quot;&gt;Low strain” jobs have high job control and low job demands. Individuals in this category are not particularly at risk of mental health problems, and it corresponds typically to creative jobs such as architects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;icon ion-battery-low&quot;&gt;Active” workers have high job demands and high job control. They are highly skilled professionals with responsibilities, such as heads or directors of companies. Those highly skilled workers have very demanding tasks but they have high levels of decision latitude to solve problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;icon ion-battery-empty&quot;&gt;Finally, workers at risk of stress-related disorders are those within the “job strain” group (high demand and low control). For example, healthcare workers from emergency departments are typically in job strain because they cannot control the huge workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in France because it is one of the industrial countries with growing numbers of occupations. The authors of the research collected data from 187 out of 1580 (11.8%) French workers who agreed to participate in a cross-sectional study using the WittyFit software online platform. The self-administered questionnaires were the Job Content Questionnaire by Karasek, the Work Addiction Risk Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and socio-demographics. The authors of this study divided all the participants based on their occupational groups and investigated the link between work addiction risk and mental and physical health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;incut&quot; readability=&quot;12.045197740113&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;g-pic&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://www.hse.ru/pubs/share/thumb/433782649:c456x456+5+6:r190x190!.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/211299142&quot;&gt;Morteza Charkhabi&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;Associate Professor at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ioe.hse.ru/en/&quot;&gt;Institute of Education&lt;/a&gt; at the HSE University&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘One of the novelties of this research was to introduce vulnerable occupational groups to organizations or job holders. For example, if we find that work addiction risk can be found more in some occupations and may result in negative outcomes for the health situation then we can give this information to decision makers in this organization or, for example, to the ministry of health. And they could intervene to prevent this problem.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;with-indent5 _builder builder--text&quot; readability=&quot;52&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results show that high job demands at work are strongly associated with work addiction risk but the job control level does not play the same role. The prevalence of work addiction risk is higher for active and high-strain workers than for passive and low-strain workers. These two groups of workers appeared to be more vulnerable and therefore can suffer more from the negative outcomes of work addiction risk, in terms of depression, sleep disorder, stress and other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We found that job demands could be the most important factor that can develop work addiction risk. So this factor should be controlled or should be investigated by the organization's manager, for example, HR staff, psychologists. Also another conclusion could be the job climate like job demands of each job category can influence the rate of work addiction risk. Thus in this study we actually focused on external factors like job demands not internal factors like the personal characteristics,’ adds Morteza Charkhabi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people with higher work addiction risk compared to people with low work addiction risk have twice the risk of developing depression. Sleep quality was lower to workers with high risk of work addiction compared to workers with low risk of work addiction. Also women had almost twice the work addiction risk than men.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Workaholism Leads to Mental and Physical Health Problems: Work Addiction Risk Depends on Occupation</og:title>
<og:description>Workaholism or work addiction risk is a growing public health concern that can lead to many negative mental and physical health outcomes such as depression, anxiety or sleep disorder. Perception of work (job demands and job control) may become a major cause of employees’ work addiction. The international group of researchers including the HSE University scientist explored the link between work addiction risk and health-related outcomes using the framework of Job Demand Control Model. The results were published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.</og:description>

<title>WRT54G History: The Router That Accidentally Went Open Source</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tedium.co/2021/01/13/linksys-wrt54g-router-history/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-whitebox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;md-big&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today in Tedium:&lt;/strong&gt; In a world where our routers look more and more like upside-down spiders than things you would like to have in your living room, there are only a handful of routers that may be considered “famous.” Steve Jobs’ efforts to sell AirPort—most famously by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tedium.co/2016/03/24/hotel-psychology-amenities-analysis/&quot;&gt;using a hula hoop during a product demo&lt;/a&gt;—definitely deserve notice in this category, and the mesh routers made by the Amazon-owned Eero probably fit in this category as well. But a certain Linksys router, despite being nearly 20 years old at this point, takes the cake—and it’s all because of a feature that initially went undocumented that proved extremely popular with a specific user base. Today’s Tedium talks about the blue-and-black icon of wireless access, the Linksys WRT54G. This is the wireless router that showed the world what a wireless router could do. &lt;em&gt;— Ernie @ Tedium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;md-redbox&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The year that Linksys was formed&lt;/strong&gt; by Janie and Victor Tsao, two Taiwanese immigrants to the United States who launched their company, initially a consultancy called DEW International, while working information technology jobs. (Victor, fun fact, was an IT manager with Taco Bell.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/20040101/linksys.html&quot;&gt;According to a 2004 profile in &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company started as a way to connect inventors with manufacturers in the Taiwanese market, but the company moved into the hardware business itself in the early 1990s, eventually landing on home networking—a field that, in the early 2000s, Linksys came to dominate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-whitebox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Linksys-EtherFast-Router.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;543&quot; alt=&quot;Linksys Ether Fast Router&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It may not look like much today, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linksys.com/us/support-product?pid=01t80000003KRN8AAO&quot;&gt;the EtherFast router&lt;/a&gt; helped Linksys drive the creation of a new market for home networking. And that was BEFORE WiFi became a big deal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How black and blue became the unofficial colors of home networking during the early 2000s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, buying a router for your home is something that a lot of people don’t think much about. Nowadays, you can buy one for a few dollars used and less than $20 new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the late 1990s, it was a complete nonentity, a market that had not been on the radar of many networking hardware companies, because the need for networking had been limited to the office. Which meant that installing a router was both extremely expensive and beyond the reach of mere mortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the kind of situation that helps companies on the periphery, not quite big enough to play with the big fish, but small enough to sense an opportunity. During its first decade of existence, Janie and Victor Tsao took advantage of such opportunities, using market shifts to help better position their networking hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early ’90s, Linksys hardware had to come with its own drivers. But when Windows 95 came along, networking was built in—and that meant a major barrier for Linksys’ market share suddenly disappeared overnight, which meant there was suddenly a growing demand for its network adapters, which fit inside desktops and laptops alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Victor was helping to lead and handle the technical end, Janie was working out distribution deals with major retailers such as Best Buy, which helped to take the networking cards mainstream in the technology world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real opportunity, the one that made Linksys hard to shake for years afterwards, came when Victor built a router with a home audience in mind. With dial-up modems on their way out, there was a sudden need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As home broadband Internet use began to bloom in the late ’90s, at costs significantly higher than those for dial-up connections, Victor realized that people were going to want to hook all their small-office or home computers to one line,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inc.com/magazine/20040101/linksys.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt; profile on Janie and Victor stated&lt;/a&gt;. “To do so they would need a router, a high-tech cord splitter allowing multiple computers to hook into one modem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies Linksys was competing with were, again, focused on a market where routers cost nearly as much as a computer itself. But Victor found the sweet spot: A $199 router that came with software that was easy to set up and reasonably understandable for mere mortals. And it had the distinctive design that Linksys became known for—a mixture of blue and biack plastics, with an array of tiny LED lights on the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a review of the EtherFast Cable/DSL router, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=NZG8wRy-WeQC&amp;amp;pg=PA66&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt; that Linksys did far more than was asked of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A price of $200 would be a breakthrough for a dual Ethernet port router, but Linksys has packed even more value into the 1.8- by 9.3- by 5.6-inch (HWD) package,” reviewer Craig Ellison wrote. The router, which could handle speeds of up to 100 megabits, sported &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; ports—and could theoretically handle hundreds of IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it wasn’t as overwhelmingly reliable as some of its more expensive competitors, but it was reasonably priced for homes, and that made it an attractive proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This router was a smash success, helping to put Linksys on top of a fledgling market with market share that put its competitors to shame. In fact, the only thing that was really wrong about the router was that it did not support wireless. But Linksys’ name recognition meant that when it did, there would be an existing audience that would find its low cost and basic use cases fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One router in particular proved specifically popular—though not for the reasons Linksys anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-redbox&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amount that Cisco,&lt;/strong&gt; the networking hardware giant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.networkworld.com/article/2340867/cisco-buys-home-networker-linksys.html&quot;&gt;acquired Linksys for in 2003&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition came at a time when Linksys was making half a billion dollars a year, and was growing fast in large part because of the success of its routers, among other networking equipment. In comments to &lt;em&gt;NetworkWorld&lt;/em&gt;, Victor Tsao claimed that there was no overlap between the unmanaged networking of Linksys routers and the managed networking of Cisco’s existing infrastructure. They did things differently—something Cisco would soon find out the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-whitebox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Linksys-Routers-WRT54G.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;665&quot; alt=&quot;Linksys Routers WRT54 G&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not only was the WRT54G cheap, it was hackable. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaygooby/&quot;&gt;Jay Gooby/Flickr&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How an accidental feature in Linksys’ wireless router turned a ho-hum router into an enthusiast device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the WRT54G router series has become something of the Nintendo Entertainment System of wireless routers. Coming around relatively early in the mainstream history of the wireless router, it showed a flexiblity far beyond what its creator intended for the device. While not the only game in town, it was overwhelmingly prevalent in homes around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although much less heralded, its success was comparable to the then-contemporary Motorola RAZR for a time, in that it was basically everywhere, on shelves in homes and small businesses around the world. The WRT54G, despite the scary name, was the wireless router people who needed a wireless router would buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And odds are, it may &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; be in use in a lot of places, even though its security standards are well past its prime and it looks extremely dated on a mantle. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a16010/30-year-old-computer-runs-school-heat/&quot;&gt;The story of the Amiga&lt;/a&gt; that controlled a school district’s HVAC systems comes to mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason the WRT54G series has held on for so long, despite using a wireless protocol that was effectively made obsolete 12 years ago, might come down to a feature that was initially undocumented—a feature that got through amid all the complications of a big merger. Intentionally or not, the WRT54G was hiding something fundamental on the router’s firmware: Software based on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a problem, because it meant that Linksys would be compelled to release the source code of its wireless firmware under the GNU General Public License, which requires the distribution of the derivative software under the same terms as the software that inspired it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/7/164&quot;&gt;Andrew Miklas, a contributor on the Linux kernel email list&lt;/a&gt;, explained that he had personally reached out to a member of the company’s staff and confirmed that the software was based on Linux … but eventually found his contact had stopped getting back top him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miklas noted that his interest in the flashed file was driven in part by a desire to see better Linux support for the still-relatively-new 802.11g standard that the device supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know that some wireless companies have been hesitant of releasing open source drivers because they are worried their radios might be pushed out of spec,” he wrote. “However, if the drivers are already written, would there be any technical reason why they could not simply be recompiled for Intel hardware, and released as binary-only modules?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mikas caught something interesting, but something that shouldn’t have been there. This was an oversight on the part of Cisco, which got an unhappy surprise about a popular product sold by its recent acquisition just months after its release. Essentially, what happened was that one of their suppliers apparently got a hold of Linux-based firmware, used it in the chips supplied to the company by Broadcom, and failed to inform Linksys, which then sold the software off to Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxinsider.com/story/open-source-and-the-legend-of-linksys-43996.html&quot;&gt;In a 2005 column for &lt;em&gt;Linux Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Heather J. Meeker, a lawyer focused on issues of intellectual property and open-source software, wrote that this would have been a tall order for Cisco to figure out on its own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first takeaway from this case is the difficulty of doing enough diligence on software development in an age of vertical disintegration. Cisco knew nothing about the problem, despite presumably having done intellectual property diligence on Linksys before it bought the company. But to confound matters, Linksys probably knew nothing of the problem either, because Linksys has been buying the culprit chipsets from Broadcom, and Broadcom also presumably did not know, because it in turn outsourced the development of the firmware for the chipset to an overseas developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To discover the problem, Cisco would have had to do diligence through three levels of product integration, which anyone in the mergers and acquisitions trade can tell you is just about impossible. This was not sloppiness or carelessness—it was opaqueness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Perens, a venture capitalist, open-source advocate, and former project leader for the Debian Linux distribution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxdevices.org/linksys-gpl-issues-raise-embedded-concerns/&quot;&gt;told &lt;em&gt;LinuxDevices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Cisco wasn’t to blame for what happened, but still faced compliance issues with the open-source license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Subcontractors in general are not doing enough to inform clients about their obligations under the GPL,” Perens said. (He added that, despite offering to help Cisco, they were not getting back to him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the info about the router with the open-source firmware was out there, and Mikas’ post quickly gained attention in the enthusiast community. A &lt;em&gt;Slashdot&lt;/em&gt; post &lt;a href=&quot;https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/03/06/08/1749217/is-linksys-violating-the-gpl&quot;&gt;could already see the possibilities&lt;/a&gt;: “This could be interesting: it might provide the possibility of building an uber-cool accesspoint firmware with IPsec and native ipv6 support etc etc, using this information!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as &lt;em&gt;Slashdot&lt;/em&gt; commentators are known to do, they spoke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It clearly wasn’t done with a sense of excitement, but within about a month of the post hitting &lt;em&gt;Slashdot&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2N24Uij&quot;&gt;the company released its open-source firmware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/WRT54G-removed-from-case.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;747&quot; alt=&quot;WRT54 G removed from case&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A WRT54G removed from its case. The device, thanks to its Linux firmware, became the target of both software and hardware hacks. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/felipefonseca/9657714445/&quot;&gt;Felipe Fonesca/Flickr&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hackers, this opened up a world of opportunity, and third-party developers quickly added capabilities to the original hardware that was never intended. This was essentially a commodity router that could be “hacked” to spit out a more powerful wireless signal at direct odds with the Federal Communications Commission, developed into an SSH server or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/64433/how-to-install-and-configure-openvpn-on-your-dd-wrt-router/&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/a&gt; for your home network, or more colorfully, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackaday.com/2008/10/07/inexpensive-powerful-router-based-robot/&quot;&gt;turned into the brains of a robot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also proved the root for some useful open-source firmware in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://openwrt.org/&quot;&gt;OpenWrt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato&quot;&gt;Tomato&lt;/a&gt;, among others, which meant that there was a whole infrastructure to help extend your router beyond what the manufacturer wanted you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco was essentially compelled by the threat of legal action to release the Linux-based firmware under the GPL, but it was not thrilled to see that the device whose success finally gave it the foothold in the home that had long evaded the company being used in ways beyond what the box said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Lifehacker&lt;/em&gt; put it way back in 2006, it was the perfect way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/turn-your-60-router-into-a-600-router-178132&quot;&gt;turn your $60 router into a $600 router&lt;/a&gt;, which likely meant it was potentially costing Cisco money to have a device this good on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a result, the company “upgraded” the router in a way that was effectively a downgrade, removing the Linux-based firmware, replacing it with a proprietary equivalent, and cutting down the amount of RAM and storage the device used, which made it difficult to replace the firmware with something created by a third party. This angered end users, and Cisco (apparently realizing it had screwed up) eventually released a Linux version of the router, the WRT54GL, which restored the specifications removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3bAHhaT&quot;&gt;That’s the model you can still find on Amazon today&lt;/a&gt;, and still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linksys.com/us/support-product?pid=01t80000003KOkNAAW&quot;&gt;maintains a support page on Linksys’ website&lt;/a&gt;—and despite topping out at just 54 megabits per second through wireless means, a paltry number given what modern routers at the same price point can do, it’s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole mess about the GPL came to bite in the years after the firmware oversight was first discovered—Cisco eventually paid a settlement to the Free Software Foundation—but it actually informed Linksys’ brand. Today, the company sells &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linksys.com/us/wireless-routers/c/wrt-wireless-routers/&quot;&gt;an entire line of black-and-blue routers&lt;/a&gt; that maintain support for open-source firmware. (They cost way more than the WRT54G ever did, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-redbox&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“We want this book to expand the audience of the WRT54G platform, and embedded device usage as a whole, unlocking the potential that this platform has to offer.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— A passage from the introduction&lt;/strong&gt; of the 2007 book &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/866/9781597491662&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linksys WRT54G Ultimate Hacking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book that played into the fact that the WRT54G was a hackable embedded system that was fully mainstream and could be used in numerous ways—both for fun and practical use cases. Yes, hacking this device became so common that there is an entire 400-page book dedicated to the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-graybox&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, to be clear, most people who bought&lt;/strong&gt; a variant of the WRT54G at Best Buy likely did not care that the firmware was open source. But the decision created a cult of sorts around the device by making it hackable and able to do more things than the box on its own might have suggested. And that cult audience helped to drive longstanding interest in the device well beyond its hacker roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an unintentional word-of-mouth play, almost. When the average person asked their tech-savvy friend, “what router should I buy,” guess which one they brought up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazyload&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.tedium.co/uploads/WRT54G-book.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1239&quot; alt=&quot;WRT54 G book&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;md-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You know something has become a legendary hacking target when there’s a book about it. (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/866/9781597491662&quot;&gt;Bookshop&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/07/the-wrt54gl-a-54mbps-router-from-2005-still-makes-millions-for-linksys/&quot;&gt;A 2016 &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; revealed the router, at the time, was &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; making millions of dollars a year for Linksys, which by that time had been sold to Belkin. Despite being nowhere near as powerful as more expensive options, the WRT54GL—yes, specifically the one with Linux—retained an audience well into its second decade because it was perceived as being extremely reliable and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ll keep building it because people keep buying it,” Linksys Global Product Manager Vince La Duca said at the time, stating that the factor that kept the router on sale was that the parts for it continued to be manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said earlier that in many ways the WRT54G was the Nintendo Entertainment System of wireless routers. And I think that is especially true in the context of the fact that it had a fairly sizable afterlife, just as the NES did. Instead of blocky graphics and limited video output options, the WRT54G’s calling cards are a very spartan design and networking capabilities that fail to keep up with the times, but somehow maintain their modern charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where routers increasingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ShortFormErnie/status/1348467226731565059&quot;&gt;look like set pieces from syndicated sci-fi shows&lt;/a&gt; from the ’90s, there is something nice about not having to think about the device that manages your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this is that, despite its extreme age and not-ready-for-the-living-room looks, it sold well for years past its sell-by date—in large part &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of its reliance on open-source drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your user base is telling you to stick with something, stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox Inc. co-founder Drew Houston waits as Dropbox (DBX) is listed for the company's initial public offering (IPO) at the Nasdaq Market Site in New York, U.S., March 23, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DBX&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; is cutting its global workforce by about 11%, the company said in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.gcs-web.com/node/8916/html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8K filing&lt;/a&gt; released Wednesday. The company's stock was down more than 4.5% in late-morning trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move will affect 315 people, who will be notified by the end of the business day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The steps we're taking today are painful, but necessary,&quot; Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said in an employee memo Wednesday. Dropbox committed to preserve job security through 2020, but Houston said that looking ahead to this year &quot;it's clear that we need to make changes in order to create a healthy and thriving business for the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the job cuts will help it focus on its top priorities for the year, which include evolving the core Dropbox experience, investing in new products and driving operational excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;26.512338425382&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox in October shifted to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/dropbox-latest-san-francisco-tech-company-making-remote-work-permanent.html&quot;&gt;standard remote work policy&lt;/a&gt;, which will be in place even after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/coronavirus-live-updates.html&quot;&gt;Covid-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; ends. For employees who need to meet or work together in person, the company said it will open &quot;Dropbox Studios&quot; in San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, Texas, and Dublin when it's safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our recent decisions regarding our new leadership structure and remote work policy have set us on the right path, and now we need to make sure our teams and investments also line up. For example, our Virtual First policy means we require fewer resources to support our in-office environment, so we're scaling back that investment and redeploying those resources to drive our ambitious product roadmap,&quot; Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox also announced Chief Operating Officer Olivia Nottebohm will leave the company Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intel CEO Bob Swan to step down, VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger to replace him</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-ceo-bob-swan-to-step-down-in-february.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-ceo-bob-swan-to-step-down-in-february.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;44.826315789474&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INTC&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; CEO Bob Swan is stepping down effective Feb. 15 and will be replaced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=VMW&quot;&gt;VMWare&lt;/a&gt; CEO Pat Gelsinger, the chipmaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/#gs.qicjtq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel's stock was up about 7% in mid-day trading. VMWare's stock was down by about 7%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swan was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/31/intel-names-robert-swan-ceo.html&quot;&gt;named CEO in January 2019&lt;/a&gt; after serving as interim CEO for seven months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Swan's tenure, Intel has suffered blows from competitors. Over the summer, Intel reported that its latest generation chips would be delayed while AMD's were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/why-intels-pain-is-amds-gain.html&quot;&gt;already shipping inside laptops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced in the fall that it will use its own proprietary chips in its Mac computers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html&quot;&gt;breaking a 15-year partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Intel for its chip supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund in December urged Intel's board to explore &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/third-point-urges-intel-to-explore-strategic-alternatives-.html&quot;&gt;strategic alternatives&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; That came after Intel lost market share to competitors AMD, Samsung and TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third Point urged Intel to divest from &quot;failed acquisitions&quot; and criticized Intel for its &quot;loss of manufacturing leadership.&quot; The firm recently took a roughly $1 billion stake in Intel, according to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the news of Swan's departure, Loeb called him &quot;a class act&quot; and said he &quot;did the right thing for all stake holders stepping aside for Gelsinger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics have pointed to the fact that Intel's chief executive did not come from a technical background, having previously served as CFO. With Gelsinger, that will no longer be the case. Gelsinger previously worked at Intel, eventually becoming its first chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel said the announcement was separate from its financial results and said it expects fourth quarter 2020 revenue and earnings to exceed prior guidance. The company said it &quot;has made strong progress&quot; on its latest generation 7 nanometer chips, which it said it would discuss when it reports earnings on Jan. 21.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Huawei controls its employees in Europe</title>
<link>https://netzpolitik.org/2021/wolf-culture-how-huawei-controls-its-employees-in-europe/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://netzpolitik.org/2021/wolf-culture-how-huawei-controls-its-employees-in-europe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wir haben diesen Artikel &lt;a href=&quot;https://netzpolitik.org/2021/wolfsgeist-wie-huawei-seine-angestellten-in-europa-kontrolliert/&quot;&gt;auch auf Deutsch veröffentlicht&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journalist with the camera causes nervousness. Minutes after he appears in front of Huawei’s European headquarters in Düsseldorf in mid-November, a stocky security guard and a female employee rush over. The street in front of the building is public space, but the company seems to feel its turf has been violated. „What do you want here?“, the woman asks. „Delete the photos.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights into the inner workings of the controversial Chinese mobile phone company are rare. Huawei has about 200,000 employees worldwide, and about 2,400 in Germany, according to the company. The European headquarters are in Düsseldorf. „We Are A Top Employer!“, a sign in the entrance area reads, beneath it orchids decorate the reception table. In the corridor hangs a photo of a hiking group posing and waving on a mountain peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What voices tell us from inside, on the other hand, belies the impression of a friendly atmosphere. They tell of a technology company that seems to see its employees first and foremost as raw materials from which it wants to forge its own success. About a company that moves Chinese employees around like chess pieces, that fires employees at will and where a quasi-military esprit de corps prevails. In Germany, the company sometimes violates the spirit, perhaps even the letter, of labour law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the result of months of investigation by netzpolitik.org with media partners of &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesignalsnetwork.org/&quot;&gt;The Signals Network&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/13/huawei-expat-employees-marry-westerners-faced-forced-leave-europe/&quot;&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; (United Kingdom), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elmundo.es/economia/2021/01/13/5ffe1f39fc6c83b1588b463e.html&quot;&gt;El Mundo&lt;/a&gt; (Spain) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.republik.ch/2021/01/13/inside-huawei&quot;&gt;Republik&lt;/a&gt; (Switzerland). Documents we have seen show, how Huawei reaches into the lives of its employees in order to achieve its goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spoken to people who have worked for the company in several European countries. Our sources come from China, but also from Germany, they worked for different subsidiaries and departments. Some ex-employees speak well of the corporation, while several interviewees make serious accusations. To protect our sources, we refrain in most cases from mentioning names and other details that could make them identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Huawei’s „wolf culture“&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their accounts paint a picture of a company that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/06/huaweis-culture-is-the-key-to-its-success&quot;&gt;celebrated in public&lt;/a&gt; for it’s seemingly modern management philosophy, but at the same time pushes employees to their limits. Ex-employees speak of a toxic corporate culture that is promoted by the company’s management. The enormous pressure to succeed also plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who play along with all this are rewarded by Huawei with special payments linked to company shares. But what happens when workers refuse to put their lives entirely at the service of their employer is shown by internal emails and covert audio recordings obtained by netzpolitik.org and its media partners, as well as court cases in several countries. The cases dealt with discrimination and dismissals that should never have happened under the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who listens carefully to Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei and pays attention to his uncompromising, war-like rhetoric will notice that Huawei makes no secret of its true corporate culture. Ren peppers his speeches with military metaphors and proudly calls his rough style of leadership „wolf culture“. In Europe, too, „wolf culture“ reigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Top jobs probably only for staff from China&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is equal in Huawei’s tight hierarchy. Metaphorically speaking, the company has two floors and employees without Chinese roots can occupy only the lower floor — no matter where they are on the official organisation chart. The top level is reserved for expats, Chinese who are sent from the company headquarters in Shenzhen to subsidiaries all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One ex-employee says there is effectively a glass ceiling for European workers. „When you walk through the corridors, it is very obvious that 99.9 per cent of the management is Chinese.“ That is probably an exaggeration, but it has a core of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese dominance is reflected in the management level of the global group, which says it operates in 170 countries around the world. Of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huawei.com/us/corporate-governance#board-of-directors&quot;&gt;17 members of Huawei’s board of directors&lt;/a&gt;, 17 are Chinese. The head of Huawei Germany is also Chinese, flanked by a German as Chief Technical Officer. Management positions held by locals appear to be little more than window dressing. „Every German manager had a shadow manager from China standing behind him“, says a former employee at the European headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Huawei spokesperson contradicts this account. He says that German managers are not shadowed by Chinese „supervisors“, nor is there a glass ceiling for non-Chinese. He states that just 59 per cent of the management are employees deployed from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the spokesperson says that in some departments there are „proven dual-head structures with a clear and sensible distribution of tasks“. According to him, it is the task of local managers to take care of local customers, market development and compliance with local law. The Chinese management, on the other hand, serves as an interface to the Chinese management level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that, according to our investigation, different rules presumably apply at Huawei for non-Chinese. They have less access to information and are excluded from important internal decisions, our sources report. At meetings, management personnel sometimes switch to Chinese at crucial moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to our questions, the company emphasises that the official working language in Europe is English and that, according to internal company rules, meetings between colleagues from different countries have to be held in English. However, several of our sources complained that expats English skills are sometimes poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A „small Chinese embassy“ in Düsseldorf&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; id=&quot;longdesc-return-298483&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-298483&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en-1200x675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Huawei has 2,400 employees in Düsseldorf. Inside there is a quasi-military esprit de corps, according to ex-employees.&quot; width=&quot;760&quot; height=&quot;428&quot; longdesc=&quot;https://netzpolitik.org?longdesc=298483&amp;amp;referrer=298497&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en-860x484.jpg 860w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en-380x214.jpg 380w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en-660x372.jpg 660w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en-160x90.jpg 160w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/hw_2en.jpg 1500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Chinese employees working in Europe are „totally isolated“, says trade unionist Ulrike Saaber &lt;span class=&quot;media-license-caption&quot;&gt;- Daniel Laufer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One source compares Huawei’s European headquarters in Düsseldorf to a „small Chinese embassy“ where Chinese employees have built up their own world. Ex-employees say that the areas of responsibility are often defined in such a way that there is little contact between employees from China and those from elsewhere. Chinese and non-Chinese at Huawei are a world apart, even outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European employees rarely find out what is really going on in the company during the day at work, says a former German employee. However, Chinese colleagues occasionally ask in the evening if they want to have dinner together. „After a few beers, you find out what is going on in the company and what is not.“ Yet many Western employees did not want to get involved and preferred to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade unionist Ulrike Saaber from Europe’s largest industrial union IG Metall has established contacts with several former Huawei workers. She describes to netzpolitik.org and its media partners the narrow world in which Chinese expats move. „The Chinese who have their roots and family in China, who only come here to work, they are totally isolated.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Saaber, Chinese expats have little knowledge of German laws and therefore hardly try to claim them for themselves. „It is often the case that these people are drawn together in their free time by representatives of their employer.“ There are informal meetings, he says, where the expats are „oriented“ along company lines. Upon request, Huawei says that joint leisure activities are organised independently by interested colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dominance of the „sea turtles“&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year after year, Huawei sends young Chinese abroad. In China, the staff who are meant to earn their spurs away from home are called „sea turtles“. Their typical profile: young, male, well-educated. Our sources indicate there is a clear hierarchy in Huawei’s Europan operation. „Sea turtles“ clearly dominate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The junior staff are under pressure: hard working conditions and constant control by the company are part of everyday life, fostering the „wolf culture“ that company boss Ren likes to invoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such „sea turtle“ is Joe. Some five years ago, Huawei sends him to Switzerland. He falls in love with a European woman, she becomes pregnant. This is what Joe reports in a joint conversation with our media partner Republik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Joe recounts, he tries to keep his girlfriend a secret, but his boss finds out. One day the man invites him to dinner. After Joe and him share a few beers, the superior asks the question: Is he planning to marry the woman?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company wants to transfer Joe, away from Switzerland. But Joe resists, so the company threatens him with dismissal. According to Joe, he fears for his safety. In mid-2018, he secretly records a video of a conversation with the HR manager. In making the recording, which netzpolitik.org and our partners have seen, Joe hopes to prove how Huawei deals with employees who want a future outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the company website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huawei.com/en/sustainability/win-win-development/develop_love&quot;&gt;Huawei promises&lt;/a&gt; to promote a caring environment that inspires a good work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, Joe can be heard saying, „My wife is going to give birth to our baby so I will probably stay here.“ But the HR manager insists that Joe agrees to a transfer. „The company has the right to decide where you work and you should follow our instructions.“ Joe refuses. He leaves the company in spring 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An internal document with the unwieldy title „Assignment and Mobility Management Regulation“ demonstrates how Huawei has also determined parts of its employees‘ private lives in Western Europe. „Those who’ve obtained residency in an EU country or whose spouses are permanent EU residents and those who have voluntarily applied for permanent residency in the EU must leave Europe as soon as possible“, the company writes in Chinese in the document. „If they don’t follow the order, the company will terminate their employment.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked, Huawei confirms in principle that such internal regulations existed. A spokesperson says that the company has no opinion on the private affairs of its employees. However, expats knew in advance about the conditions of their foreign assignment. If there are conflicts between these and the employee’s private life, „the employee must comply with Huawei’s international assignment policy and the international assignment agreement signed by the employee“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days later, a spokesperson tells us that the regulation on residence permits is no longer valid — however, when asked, he did not want to say since when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;„Please don’t tell anyone that I’m learning German“&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence of the tough corporate policy is apparently a climate of fear. According to our Düsseldorf sources, the mistrust already starts when expats acquire knowledge of local languages. „Please don’t tell anyone that I’m learning German“, a Chinese employee is reported to have said to a former colleague who spoke to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Spain, a case landed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poderjudicial.es/search/AN/openCDocument/58390c5d580b98ef655cf4715fc787b33092e3d62e6675ba&quot;&gt;in court&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that shows how Huawei apparently wants to have a say in the family planning of its employees. The plaintiff is a woman who goes by the pseudonym Ana. She accuses the company of sexist discrimination. Ana is Chinese, an expat. For almost a decade she worked in a senior position in the group’s finance department. Huawei sends her to Spain, where she marries a local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the woman wants to have a child, the trouble begins. Twice she suffers a miscarriage, twice she calls in sick afterwards. Huawei claims Ana’s work performance has declined and curbs her annual bonus, according to court documents. When she starts fertility treatment and calls in sick again, the company fires her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ana sues the company and wins. The court rules that the dismissal was not legal. A spokesperson for Huawei tells netzpolitik.org and its media partners that the Spanish judiciary has never ruled that the dismissal was due to discrimination against a pregnant woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in a written submission to court, Ana’s lawyer makes serious allegations against Huawei: „This decision to penalise the employee in her remuneration as a consequence for her leaves of absence due to abortions suffered during her pregnancies presents itself no longer as a hint but as direct proof in fact — consequence, of discrimination based on sex, derived from her two frustrated attempts at maternity.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of the proceedings, a pattern seems to emerge. A member of the workers’ council at Huawei’s subsidiary tells the court that she knows of at least five women who have become mothers and lost their jobs at Huawei. Three of them were Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Those who resign must sell their shares&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons why Huawei can treat its employees like this and yet hardly anyone rebels. One is the way the company pays its Chinese employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working for Huawei for some time, they receive share certificates in the company, which formally is owned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzz.ch/pro-global/asien/huawei-ein-staatsunternehmen-nzz-asien-ld.1541803?reduced=true&quot;&gt;99 per cent by Huawei’s union&lt;/a&gt;. The shares are used to give employees a cut of the profits. According to the company, this is done to motivate them. For them, the model seems lucrative, but only as long as their plans are aligned with those of Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, employees do not truly have a stake in the company: anyone who resigns or is fired is forced by the company to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huawei.com/de/facts/question-answer/who-owns-huawei&quot;&gt;sell their shares back&lt;/a&gt;. According to a Huawei spokesperson, this is in line with „our long-established, generally known and contractually fixed rules in this area“. The only exceptions are for long-serving, older employees, who are allowed to keep their shares when they retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retirement age in China is 60 for men and 55 for women. At Huawei, however, according to our sources, it is common to end one’s career already in one’s mid-40s. When long-serving Chinese managers reach this age, they often cash out the value of their company shares and effectively retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if an expat decides against returning to China, they not only lose their job, but also this form of retirement provision. „Huawei is a company, not a prison: if you want to quit, you can quit. But this decision is not easy,“ says a source who worked for the European headquarters in Düsseldorf for more than five years, including in the human resources department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strict rotation principle for expats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is determined to prevent expats from putting down roots outside of China and obtaining residency rights in European countries, says a source who worked for the company for several years. „The internal atmosphere at the company is that if you marry a local person and get citizenship rights, then this is seen as a betrayal“, an ex-employee in London tells our media partner The Daily Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method the company uses to enforce the loyalty of Chinese employees is the strict rotation principle. No expat can stay in the same country outside of China for more than five years. Several sources say that the company wants to prevent Chinese employees from developing close ties to their host country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Huawei categorically refuses to compromise on this. „Upon the completion of a five continuous years assignment in a country, expatriates who are not interfacing with the customers will be relocated regardless of all factors“, Huawei’s guidelines, for Western Europe, state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the internal document, the company makes clear what the rule is probably really about: control. „This regulation is hence established to warrant that the expatriates from China adhere to the Company’s arrangements.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the group, „the principle of rotation is important and essential at many different levels“, a Huawei spokesperson said. The constant change of location allows the organisation to remain flexible, and employees can gain experience in different roles and countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Veterans from the telecoms industry wanted&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei has been suspected of espionage in the West for years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tech.newstatesman.com/security/where-every-country-stands-huawei&quot;&gt;Great Britain, Sweden, Australia and other countries&lt;/a&gt; have banned the installation of Huawei components in their 5G networks. In the USA, the company is practically excluded from the market altogether. In December, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article222354884/Huawei-Manager-soll-Mitarbeiter-mit-Industriespionage-beauftragt-haben.html&quot;&gt;Welt am Sonntag reported&lt;/a&gt; that a manager had asked employees in Germany to explore and copy the software of a competitor. Accordingly, the company denied the accusation. Accusations against Huawei of helping the Chinese state with espionage have so far been unproven. But there is no doubt that the company plays a key role in China’s quest for technological sovereignty and supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book „The Management Transformation of Huawei“ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/management-transformation-of-huawei/huaweis-internationalization-journey/A0289282BB64A1387F288027C2300D53&quot;&gt;retells the story of the group&lt;/a&gt;. In its efforts to gain a foothold outside China, it was not welcomed with open arms. In response, it had to hire local staff in host countries in addition to expats, Wen Li, Xiaoran Chan and Bin Guo write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, according to our investigation, Huawei likes to hire veterans from the telecommunications industry who are lured by the salaries of the Chinese company. At its European headquarters in Düsseldorf, it gathers experienced staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„A few years at Huawei doesn’t hurt anyone who wants to work in this industry because you can really learn a lot“, says a former German manager who quit in 2019. That year, he says, Huawei was the „biggest gorilla in the whole market“. Another person who worked for the company in Düsseldorf also says: „I don’t regret my time at Huawei, I learned a lot.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei appears to hold ex-employees of competitors in high regard. That is illustrated by internal documents that netzpolitik.org and its media partners have seen. In HR forms, the firm records, among other things, the work experience of its employees. One line is reserved for competitors, such as Cisco, Ericsson, ZTE. The next line is for experience with potential clients, such as T-Mobile and Telefonica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s subsidiaries pass on personnel data of their German employees to the headquarters in China and a branch in Malaysia, which became known last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/arbgs/duesseldorf/arbg_duesseldorf/j2020/9_Ca_6557_18_Urteil_20200305.html&quot;&gt;through a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. As first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiwo.de/my/unternehmen/it/huawei-in-china-wissen-sie-alles/25683032.html&quot;&gt;reported by WirtschaftsWoche&lt;/a&gt;, the court awarded the employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/arbgs/duesseldorf/arbg_duesseldorf/j2020/9_Ca_6557_18_Urteil_20200305.html&quot;&gt;damages from Huawei&lt;/a&gt; because the company refused to provide information about what data it had collected about him and what had happened to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hardly any employees over 50 work at Huawei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei demands discipline and loyalty from its European managers just as it does from its expats. But the loyalty the company demands is only partially met by itself, especially towards older European employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have spoken to several former employees who were fired by the company. Their accounts are similar: „I always did everything exactly by the book“, says one of our sources. Nevertheless, Huawei fired the source after several years of loyal service. The ex-employee doesn’t want to read their name on the internet, to avoid trouble with the company, but says their only offence was their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei appears to take pride in its young workforce. Of 194,000 employees worldwide in 2019, only two per cent are older than 50 years, the company says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huawei.com/en/sustainability/win-win-development/develop_love&quot;&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei does not like it when someone is employed by the company beyond their 60th birthday, according to several of our sources. According to them, if older employees do not leave voluntarily, Huawei resorts to pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot write details of a number of such cases, because they might allow conclusions to be drawn about the identity of the persons concerned. This could expose them to legal retaliation by the company. According to our sources, Huawei is not squeamish in its choice of means to get rid of workers of advanced age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, several cases have ended up in court. In those, Huawei dismissed workers who were around 50 or older without an obvious reason. Some cases have long since been closed and Huawei has paid large sums in compensation. But the company seems to accept legal trouble to get rid of disagreeable staff after years of good service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former German manager who worked for the European headquarters for almost ten years says he has heard of dismissals that were not formally correct because, for example, there had been no warning beforehand. „This is then settled with money — the company doesn’t care at all. The main thing is that the problem is solved.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei probably prefers that those affected leave of their own accord. The company’s tactics are said to include giving them meaningless tasks or no tasks at all, as well as transferring them to other workplaces, sometimes even to other company locations. This is done to disrupt the daily lives of those affected and to give them the feeling that they are no longer welcome at Huawei, is the interpretation of one of those affected. Some talk of harassment. Upon request, Huawei states that it does not resort to any such measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accusations are also made in another European country where the company does business. A labour court in Madrid concludes in November 2020 that Huawei dismissed five of its middle-aged Spanish employees without just cause. The judge ruled that Huawei had discriminated against them, because of their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court awards the victims compensation of 20,000 euros each. According to the court, a speech by founder Ren Zhengfei supposedly shows that such dismissals are company policy, as employees over 50 and over 60 cost the company millions of euros in additional expenses. A German spokesperson insists that Ren’s statement was taken out of context: He had actually wanted to encourage older employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the spokesperson, Huawei „strictly rejects“ the accusation of age discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The fear of a workers‘ council&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s treatment of its employees is also causing frustration among trade unions. Attempts to establish a workers‘ council at Huawei’s European headquarters in Düsseldorf have so far been fruitless, says unionist Ulrike Saaber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company spokesperson writes to us that Huawei respects the German Works Constitution Act and has done nothing to prevent the formation of a workers‘ council. „The initiative to establish a workers‘ council lies with the employees, not the company.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Saaber, the union has tried time and again to contact employees, but Chinese workers duck it „because they are afraid“. Without employees willing to even stand, the union is fighting a losing battle. „This undermines the Works Constitution Act, which actually stipulates that a workers‘ council must be formed if there are five or more employees“, says Saaber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in one of Huawei’s German subsidiaries are workers allowed to appoint their own representatives. Huawei had taken over several hundred employees from Ericsson in 2016, most of them union members. After months of negotiations and threats of strikes by workers, Huawei gave in and Huawei Technologies Service GmbH had to accept &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.igmetall-berlin.de/aktuelles/meldung/tariferfolg-der-ig-metall-bei-huawei-huawei-ts-tritt-arbeitgeberverband-bei/&quot;&gt;union collective bargaining&lt;/a&gt; and a workers‘ council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even that does little to change the power relations in the subsidiary, Saaber speculates. „Personally, I only ever had contact with the German representatives at Huawei TS, even though it was clear that behind every German managing director or HR manager there was some Chinese mirror figure.“ The structures are strictly hierarchical, he said. „The German managing directors have little to say and always have to coordinate all the way to China. They are not actually allowed to decide anything on their own.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions at Huawei are not only a problem for the company’s workers, but also for its competitors. „If workers‘ rights are not respected — be it in terms of working hours or pay — such companies can offer cheaper. They can operate around the clock without any problems and thus distort competition.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs under the leadership of Hubertus Heil (SPD) did not want to comment on the Huawei case when asked by netzpolitik.org and its media partners. A spokesperson stated that they do not comment on individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;„Coming second is not an option“&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei itself takes the position that the only way to get opportunities is through hard work, the Harvard Business Review noted in 2015. It described the company’s culture as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2015/06/huaweis-culture-is-the-key-to-its-success&quot;&gt;„key to success“&lt;/a&gt;. For some employees, however, it is more of a burden, as our investigation shows. The pressure to succeed within the company is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„If you don’t sell anything, you can expect to be demoted“, says a source who worked at the European headquarters for a long time. For the company, it is irrelevant whether success fails to materialise because of one’s own performance or because of external conditions over which employees have no influence. Another person who has worked at the company for more than five years sums up the management philosophy as follows: „Coming second is not an option for Huawei.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s strict, „wolfish“ company culture is part of its corporate folklore and at the same time part of everyday life. New employees at the company’s headquarters in Shenzhen have to endure a two-week boot camp, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/bloodthirsty-like-a-wolf-inside-the-military-style-discipline-at-chinas-tech-titan-huawei/2018/12/12/76055116-fd85-11e8-a17e-162b712e8fc2_story.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post reported&lt;/a&gt;. Its components include daily training runs at five o’clock in the morning and courses that actually bear the name „brainwashing“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How deeply military thinking is rooted in the company is also expressed in a framed calligraphy that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/huawei-workers-iran-sanctions.html&quot;&gt;according to the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, hangs on the wall at the company’s headquarters. In Chinese script, it reads: „Sacrifice is a soldier’s highest cause. Victory is a soldier’s greatest contribution.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Errors are pilloried internally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sources agree that Huawei regularly punishes its Chinese employees for their alleged failures, often in front of the eyes or ears of colleagues — this also happens at the Düsseldorf headquarters. Via internal e-mail lists, the company sometimes lets everyone know who, in Huawei’s opinion, has not behaved properly and what sanctions have been imposed on them. According to our sources, the company holds its managers responsible for the missteps of individuals. Within the group, they are treated as parents to their employees, their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company frequently hosts what ex-employees call „criticism and self-criticism“, in the style of a communist ritual in the spirit of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. A Chinese manager, for example, had to admit fault in a telephone conference after a bidding process failed, a non-Chinese source tells us, who says they took part in it himself. Everyone present was asked to criticise the man. Our source says they were very uncomfortable. Shortly afterwards, Huawei sent the manager from Düsseldorf back to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-reflection is „an important principle of our corporate culture“ and served to improve the company and its products and services, Huawei states. Managers are encouraged to discuss the current situation in team meetings and to explore „room for improvement“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Complaints about working hours at Huawei&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to working hours, the technology company also follows a course that is rather unusual in Europe. Attendance often extends beyond core working hours, in tune with the so-called 9-9-6 principle for employees in China. The principle refers to employees’ suggested presence in the office from nine a.m. to nine p.m., six days a week. In the early years, Huawei even distributed blankets and mattresses to new employees, according to the quasi-official company biography „The Huawei Story“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Düsseldorf, working hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. are the rule, at least on paper, but according to former employees, Huawei demands much longer hours from employees in some departments. Ex-employees tell of meetings at the European headquarters that are scheduled at 10 p.m. and of offices that are bustling even on Sundays. Chinese employees sometimes slept in their offices, says a former employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hardly compatible with German labour law. For years, workers at the Düsseldorf site could only enter their arrival in a time recording system, our sources report, but the company did not allow records of the end of working days. Non-Chinese employees rebelled and have since been effectively exempted from the rule. Expats, however, are denied proper recording of their working hours, according to our sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company spokesperson insists to netzpolitik.org and its media partners that working hours are not recorded, but only the attendance of employees. At the same time, he admits that there have indeed been complaints about the recording of attendance at the European headquarters. The competent authority also confirms that complaints under labour law have been received. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article218512776/Huawei-Hinweise-auf-Verstoesse-gegen-Arbeits-und-Aufenthaltsrecht.html&quot;&gt;Welt am Sonntag had first reported&lt;/a&gt; on such complaints. Since 2018, Huawei has been „inspected for compliance with occupational health and safety regulations, in particular the regulations in the Working Hours Act“, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fragdenstaat.de/anfrage/prufung-wegen-verstoen-gegen-arbeits-und-aufenthaltsrecht/&quot;&gt;Düsseldorf district government&lt;/a&gt; informs us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei states that it complies with European labour law. Employees are allowed to work after 8 p.m. „on a voluntary basis”, as long as they do not exceed the maximum working hours of ten hours per day. „It is not the case that employees regularly spend the night in the office“, a company spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Image and reality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinologist Mareike Ohlberg, who works for the think tank German Marshall Fund, sees Huawei in a pinch. The most important thing for the company is still the Chinese market, she told netzpolitik.org and its media partners. So it has to emphasise its loyalty to the Communist Party. To the outside world, however, Huawei tries to present itself as an international, modern company. „This happens largely in rhetoric and not in practice.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohlberg advises applying the same standard to Huawei as to other technology companies like Google or Apple. She says that just because a company is from China, it should not be allowed to treat its employees badly. If it is active on the German market or in other Western countries, it must also adhere to corresponding ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„In terms of the rights you have as an employee, you are often a lot worse off in China than here“, says Ohlberg. „When employees are hired locally here, work cultures and different ways of dealing collide. „In her opinion, however, there is little interest at Huawei in changing the company culture in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;„Heroes are forged, not born“&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-file.huawei.com/-/media/corp/facts/pdf/on_the_recordhuawei_executives_speak_to_the_public_volumei.pdf?la=en&quot;&gt;illustration of a brochure&lt;/a&gt; that the corporation distributes to its employees says a lot about how it seems to see them. As if human beings were raw materials that could be processed in a factory into the perfect soldier. One picture shows a shot-up Russian fighter plane from the Second World War that nevertheless continued to fly, as Huawei points out in the accompanying text. The caption reads, „Heroes are forged, not born.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/heroes_are_forged_not_born_en.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; id=&quot;longdesc-return-298489&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-298489&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/heroes_are_forged_not_born_en-675x675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Motif from a company brochure&quot; width=&quot;675&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; longdesc=&quot;https://netzpolitik.org?longdesc=298489&amp;amp;referrer=298497&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/heroes_are_forged_not_born_en-675x675.jpg 675w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/heroes_are_forged_not_born_en-484x484.jpg 484w, https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/01/heroes_are_forged_not_born_en.jpg 1500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A company brochure uses martial motifs to motivate employees to act decisively &lt;span class=&quot;media-license-caption&quot;&gt;- Alle Rechte vorbehalten Huawei&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the company is trying to inculcate its employees with this fiery management rhetoric. Former employees from Europe with whom we spoke found it strange. Nevertheless, it is apparently practised in the company. Huawei offers an atmosphere of high pressure, but little support or positive feedback, our sources say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers would raise their voices with Chinese employees for even the slightest misconduct. According to former employees, the management system is to blame. In this system, managers often moved back and forth between quite different departments. Several sources tell of bosses who are technically well informed, but who ultimately lack people skills and leadership experience. „It’s a nerd’s den“, says a long-time German employee who has since left Huawei on good terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On request, the company claims that the motif with the fighter plane has „nothing specific to do with everyday work at Huawei“. But the graphic could also be seen in an email that has now been obtained by netzpolitik.org and its media partners. The human resources department of the European headquarters sent it to employees via a distribution list as early as August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email contains a speech allegedly given by Ren Zhengfei at a swearing-in ceremony for employees. According to the speech, the founder said that Huawei needed to improve the skills of its „warhead teams“ that were closest to customers. He spoke about a „sound of artillery“ that employees in the field could hear. They should form „regional field armies“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Huawei says he cannot recognize any generally bellicose pattern in corporate rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rommel as inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the military metaphors are deeply embedded in the group’s DNA. For almost a decade, Ren Zhengfei worked as an engineer for the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. When he founded Huawei in 1987, the company initially supplied the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in everyday life, according to our sources, executives at Huawei like to talk about „generals“ and supposed „battles“ at a „front“. In an e-mail to employees at the European headquarters, Huawei is said to have referred at least once to the Wehrmacht general Erwin Rommel as a source of inspiration. Until recently, there was also a Chinese-language entry on Huawei’s website praising Rommel as an „invincible“ commander in North Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;„Victory language“, is what one ex-employee calls the martial language. Some non-Chinese employees apparently found it highly irritating. A company spokesperson asserts that, as a matter of principle, there is no positive reference to Nazi Germany at Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bellicose rhetoric and the questionable figure of reference not only fit into the company’s world view, they are even a core element of it’s thinking. Company founder Ren sees economic competition as a constant „struggle for survival“, writes Eric Flamholtz, professor emeritus of management at the University of California, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corporate-culture-nuclear-bomb-huawei-eric-flamholtz/&quot;&gt;studied Huawei&lt;/a&gt;. Accordingly, Ren sees corporate culture as the „ultimate weapon“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The investigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is the result of months of investigation on documents reviewed by the media partners of The Signals Network including The Daily Telegraph (United Kingdom), El Mundo (Spain), Republik (Switzerland) and netzpolitik.org (Germany). The Signals Network coordinated the collaboration of this international investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesignalsnetwork.org/&quot;&gt;The Signals Network&lt;/a&gt; is a European-American non-profit organisation founded by Gilles Raymond and led by Delphine Halgand-Mishra.

<og:description>Former employees accuse Huawei of discrimination.

&lt;td readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;I recently saw that some Google employees are attempting to unionize and someone mentioned that Google's customers wish they could unionize.
&lt;p&gt;That lead me to wonder: Could Google's customers form some sort of union and attempt to hold discussions with Google?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand I think it would in Google's interests to do everything to prevent having another party to have to negotiate with. On the other hand, if there was a union of customers and they occasionally demanded something everyone thinks is reasonable in the press, that may start something. Especially if Google caves on some of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
