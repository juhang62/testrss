<title>Japan’s elaborate, colorful manhole covers</title>
<link>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/japanese-manhole-covers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/japanese-manhole-covers</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;In Japan’s glittering cities, all&lt;/span&gt; hustle and light, they can be easy to miss. With all that sensory assault, who thinks to look down and take notice of something as mundane as a manhole cover? But these are no ordinary bits of civic infrastructure. In Japan, many manhole covers are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/28074232@N06/sets/72157612036691185/&quot;&gt;works of urban art&lt;/a&gt;—elaborate, curious, distinctive, even colorful. They have become a tourist destination unto themselves, and attract a legion of dedicated manhole enthusiasts who travel the country to visit some of the thousands of unique designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Japan’s decorated manhole covers—broadly encompassing storm drain, domestic water supply, electrical and other utility access covers—initially took shape as a public relations campaign for sewers. Beginning in the 1950s, the cast plates featured simple geometric patterns, such as the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/coolnobby777/folder/570411.html?m=lc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;” and “Nagoya” designs. Japanese civil servant Yasutake Kameda conceived of the intricate, artistic versions in 1985, to help warm a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jgma.gr.jp/mame/history/&quot;&gt;skeptical rural population&lt;/a&gt; to the idea of the costly but necessary modernization of the country’s sewer system. From these humble, practical beginnings, manhole covers have become a cultural phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;That's 80 pounds of Hello Kitty in Tama City. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63698&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/63698/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;That’s 80 pounds of Hello Kitty in Tama City. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Typically, “local manholes” or “design manholes” feature elements special to a particular location: a town emblem, landmark, event, or official bird or flower. For instance, Takasaki, 60 miles northwest of Tokyo in mountainous Gunma Prefecture, has manhole covers that commemorate the city’s popular summer fireworks festival. Local mascots (known as &lt;em&gt;yurukyara&lt;/em&gt;, such as Fukaya City’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://charazoo.com/FUKKACHAN&quot;&gt;adorable rabbit-deer Fukkachan&lt;/a&gt;) and cartoon characters also appear. In Tokyo’s Tama ward, home of the Sanrio Puroland amusement park, one can find covers featuring the ever-popular Hello Kitty. Local sports franchises are also represented near the teams’ home arenas and stadiums—such as the well-known colorful depiction of the logo of the Hiroshima Carp baseball team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;While there is some logic to the placement of the covers, particularly those graced with color—usually near a landmark, theme park, or stadium—others appear to have been placed without rhyme or reason. Indeed, it is not unusual to walk down an otherwise unremarkable side street and spot a special one underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Popular baseball team Hiroshima Carp graces local manhole covers. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63704&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/63704/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Popular baseball team Hiroshima Carp graces local manhole covers. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Manhole_hiroshima.jpg&quot;&gt;VKaeru/Wikimedia/cropped from original/CC-BY-SA-3.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The ornate manhole covers are initially carved from aluminum, which is used to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/views/b06305/japan-and-the-art-of-making-manhole-covers-photo-gallery.html?pnum=1&quot;&gt;sand molds&lt;/a&gt; for casting. The majority of the designs are selected by local municipalities, in conjunction with manufacturers. In most cases, the design is just imprinted in the cover, but in some cases the covers get another touch—colored resins flooded into voids like enamel on jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Today an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://japantoday.com/category/features/drainspotting-japanese-manhole-covers&quot;&gt;95 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Japan’s 1,718 municipalities, across all 47 prefectures, now host their own unique covers. In Osaka, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20150510072430/http:/www.sankei.com/region/news/150308/rgn1503080006-n1.html&quot;&gt;approximately 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s 180,000 manhole covers feature ornate designs, of which roughly 1,900 get the color treatment. Typically, a designed manhole cover, which weighs more than 80 pounds, excluding the frame, costs approximately $585—a five percent premium over the cost of a plain cover. The color, however, is applied carefully by hand, and nearly doubles the price of a manhole to more than $900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Such is the popularity of these little urban treasures that they have a devout, organized following. There is the industry-led Japan Ground Manhole Association, and the fan-based Japanese Society of Manhole Covers, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://usagigasi1f2.starfree.jp/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; features thousands of photographs submitted by users across Japan, who have snapped everything from large sewer covers to tiny local utility access panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;There are some 12,000 different manhole cover designs in Japan, including this one in Kawaguchi. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63699&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/63699/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;There are some 12,000 different manhole cover designs in Japan, including this one in Kawaguchi. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/manhole-spotting-a-new-tourism-beat&quot;&gt;Manholers&lt;/a&gt;,” as they’re known, may travel to distant areas of the country just to photograph covers or collect pencil rubbings known as &lt;em&gt;takuhon&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gk-p.jp/mhcard/&quot;&gt;Trading cards&lt;/a&gt; featuring manhole designs are also popular collectors’ items, and can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tokyoweekender.com/2016/03/japanese-decorative-manhole-covers-get-their-own-trading-cards/&quot;&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; steep prices in online auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;One prominent fan is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keibambooty&quot;&gt;Kei Takebuchi&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Tokyo-based singer-songwriter. Takebuchi traces her fascination with them to the covers of Nagoya, which feature a charming cartoon water strider insect, while she was on tour in 2015. Since then, she has regularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keibambooty/status/857198046999855105&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; photos of manhole covers to her nearly 200,000 followers on social media. “Every manhole cover design has [a meaning] … it tells me that we can create art with almost anything,” she says, in an interview for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Like many places, Japan is full of people with unusual hobbies or obsessions, but love for the country’s manhole covers has gone mainstream: a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.designboom.com/art/japanese-manhole-covers-festival-02-01-2019/&quot;&gt;manhole festival&lt;/a&gt;” was held near a major train station in Tokyo last month, featuring trading cards, baked goods, and replica covers from around the country. Retailer &lt;a href=&quot;https://shinjuku.tokyu-hands.co.jp/item/-2019-in.html&quot;&gt;Tokyu Hands&lt;/a&gt; ran an extended campaign at its central Shinjuku location, with a range of manhole cover–related goods for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Singer Kei Takebuchi spent hours in Kawagoe City to capture this photograph of a manhole cover depicting a historic bell tower. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63701&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/63701/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Singer Kei Takebuchi spent hours in Kawagoe City to capture this photograph of a manhole cover depicting a historic bell tower. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Kei Takebuchi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The affinity for manhole covers also seems to tap in to Japan’s fondness for hobbies that involve lots of domestic travel. &lt;a href=&quot;http://voyapon.com/notebook-stamp-hobby/&quot;&gt;Stamp rallies—&lt;/a&gt;featuring rubber stamps at train stations and other landmarks—encourage hobbyists to travel to overlooked or lesser-visited locales to add one more stamp to their collections. “Rail-fans” similarly scour the country to document or experience a rare train carriage, an unusual station melody, or other rail-related minutia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;It is the same for manholers, with the occasionally far-flung or seemingly random placement of coveted covers—and directions of varying accuracy—adding to the sense of a scavenger hunt. Indeed, Takebuchi recounts once spending three hours on a bitterly cold day in Kawagoe City in Saitama Prefecture to snap a photo of a particular manhole cover, beautifully designed with an images of Toki no Kane, a historic bell tower. Similar stories are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/manhole-covers-depicting-legends-captivate-japanese-j9mr9zlsr&quot;&gt;common currency&lt;/a&gt; in manholing circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Easy to overlook, but curious and rewarding, Japan’s unique manhole covers are a charming reminder that the mundane can be exciting, and that you should never forget to look down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Not every manhole cover gets a colorful design, like this one in Matsumoto, so sometimes enthusiasts must search for them. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63707&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/63707/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Not every manhole cover gets a colorful design, like this one in Matsumoto, so sometimes enthusiasts must search for them. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Manhole-cover-matsumoto-colour.jpg&quot;&gt;HAL-Guandu/Wikimedia/cropped from original/CC-BY-SA-4.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A manhole cover in Nagoya depicts a water strider. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63702&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/63702/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;A manhole cover in Nagoya depicts a water strider. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Manhole_cover_in_Nagoya,_2014.jpg&quot;&gt;bryan…/Wikimedia/CC-BY-SA-2.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A manhole cover in Tokyo depicting &amp;quot;fireboys.&amp;quot; &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63700&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/63700/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;A manhole cover in Tokyo depicting “fireboys.” &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Vcarceler/Wikimedia/cropped from original/CC-BY-SA-3.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A fish manhole in Hiroshima. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63706&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/63706/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;A fish manhole in Hiroshima. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Manhole_fish_2.jpg%20&quot;&gt;VKaeru/Wikimedia/cropped from original/CC-BY-SA-3.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A manhole depicting Osaka Castle. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-63705&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/63705/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;A manhole depicting Osaka Castle. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/dunhillcapina/5453277526&quot;&gt;dunhilaryu/Flickr/cropped from original/CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>What the Hell Is Going On? Effects of Information Abundance</title>
<link>https://www.perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.perell.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-going-on</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Commerce and Mass Media are Connected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commerce and media are interdependent. You can’t understand commerce without understanding the media environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union of advertisers and Mass Media shaped post-World War II commerce. Major media outlets, such as television networks and newspapers, had a monopoly on distribution to customers. Centralization in distribution mirrored the centralization in advertising agencies and media conglomerates. The four major advertising agency holding companies (Omnicom, WPP, Interpublic, and Publicis) were built for a Mass Media world with limited media outlets. These agencies lived at the heart of cultural influence. They influenced advertising, design, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perell.com/blog/that-is-marketing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt;, media buying, and public relations. Likewise, six global media conglomerates (Time Warner, Disney, NewsCorp, Vivendi Universal, Bertelsmann, and Viacom) controlled the production and distribution of content. Financed, in part, by relationships with the aforementioned advertising agencies, these powerful conglomerates cross-promoted their own films, magazines, books, and television series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptical and unaware of obscure brands, people with money to spend flocked to big brands with big-time name recognition. Habits formed. Once a person trusted a brand, they kept buying its products. From 1923-1983, in the top 25 CPG categories, 20 market leaders maintained #1 share the entire time. Spurred by steep barriers to entry for emerging competitors, advertising and shopping environments—which were defined by scarcity—ensured the continual success of America’s biggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perell.com/blog/that-is-marketing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by economies of scale, the big got bigger. In 1958, the average company in the S&amp;amp;P 500 had been there an average of 61 years. Only the biggest brands could afford television advertising and endure costly funnel inefficiencies. As Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s longtime business partner observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In effect, if you didn’t have a big volume, you couldn’t use network TV advertising — which was the most effective technique. So when TV came in, the branded companies that were already big got a huge tailwind.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a near-monopoly on television advertising, America’s biggest brands sold average products for average people in average households. Here’s how Simon Cowell, the famous American Idol judge explained his gift for identifying musical talent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I have average tastes. If you looked in my collection of DVDs, you’d see Jaws and Star Wars. In the book library, you’d see John Grisham and Sidney Sheldon. And if you look in my fridge, it’s children’s food — chips, milkshakes, yogurt.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big brands lined the shelves of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perell.com/blog/wal-mart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; and the aisles at Walgreens. Small brands with unique value propositions were impossible to find. Television equalized culture. The rich and poor consumed the same entertainment at the same time. In the 1950s, 70 percent of American television sets sometimes tuned into &lt;em&gt;I Love Lucy.&lt;/em&gt; Millions of Americans were in sync. They watched the same shows at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social cohesion, at the scale of major events like &lt;em&gt;I Love Lucy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Super Bowl&lt;/em&gt;, was impossible without Mass Media. Before television, so many people had never watched the exact same event at the exact same time. The Super Bowl is the biggest collective event left. It’s a national ritual. Every year, on the first Sunday of February, America stops to watch helmets clash on the field and celebrities perform at halftime. For most of the game, our attention is scattered between food, friends and the game. We care mostly about the chips and guacamole until the commercials,  when all conversation stops and across America, 100 million sets of eyes focus on the television in front of them. At work the next day, as you wait for your coffee to brew, everybody talks about their favorite commercials. Television networks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perell.com/blog/that-is-marketing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advertisers&lt;/a&gt; grew on the same prosperous vine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid, back when I was no taller than Spongebob Squarepants, I read the sports section of the newspaper every morning. Growing up in San Francisco, I had four choices: The &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, The Oakland Tribune, The San Jose Mercury News,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; Reading the newspaper was my favorite ritual. But now, my daily sports entertainment comes from internet bloggers who tweet in their underwear. Unless I’m on an airplane with no Wi-Fi and out of battery on my phone, I won’t read the newspaper. The internet is better on every dimension: cost, convenience, depth, speed, personalization. You name it. Location no longer limits my choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mass Media ecosystem worked in perfect balance: television networks were intertwined with the advertisers who supported them, the products they sold, and the ways consumers bought and sold products. Television. Cars. Newspapers. Beer. Radio. Deodorant. It’s an integrated system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass market products were designed to reach the largest group of people. They served the broadest tastes. Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, which topped the list of America’s largest advertisers operated with a simple formula. As Ben Thompson wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/dollar-shave-club-and-the-disruption-of-everything/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dollar Shave Club and the Disruption of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;P&amp;amp;G leveraged these resources in a simple formula that led to repeated success:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Spend significant resources on developing new products (more blades!) that can command a price premium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Spend even more resources on advertising the new product (mostly on TV) to create consumer awareness and demand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Spend yet more resources to ensure the new product is front-and-center in retail locations everywhere.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For multiple decades, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble dominated consumer goods. You undoubtedly know their products, such as Charmin, Old-Spice, Vicks, Oral-B, Swiffer, Tide, and Mr. Clean. P&amp;amp;G grew its total addressable market with mass media advertising and distribution agreements with every major supermarket and pharmacy. They went into big box retailers, purchased finite shelf space, and expanded in-store real estate through brand extensions and favorable product placement. Gillette (owned by Procter &amp;amp; Gamble) raised prices, increased their margins, and sold “more blades for more money,” sometimes without improving the underlying product. Here’s Ben Thompson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;That’s exactly what had happened with the Mach 3, Gillette’s previous top-of-the-line model: Gillette increased blade and razor revenue by nearly 50% with basically no change in underlying demand, easily making back the $750 million it cost to research and develop the razor, simply through its ability to charge a premium for new technology, create awareness and demand through advertising, and capture consumers through retail shelf dominance.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procter &amp;amp; Gamble's success was locked-in and impossible to deny. That lock-in was made stronger by P&amp;amp;G’s long roster of brands, which gave the company massive scale efficiencies in logistics and manufacturing. The world’s largest advertiser basically doubled its revenue every decade from 1950 to 2010. Without the consent of Retail Buyers, products didn’t make it to the shelves. Propelled by strong relationships with those buyers and access to shelf space, a scarce resource in the pre-internet economy, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble ensured prime product placement in retail stores and commanded a price premium as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Thinkpad X210</title>
<link>https://geoff.greer.fm/2019/03/04/thinkpad-x210/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://geoff.greer.fm/2019/03/04/thinkpad-x210/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoff.greer.fm/2017/01/23/oldest-viable-laptop/&quot;&gt;I used an old Thinkpad while my MacBook was being repaired&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed the experience so much that &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoff.greer.fm/2017/07/16/thinkpad-x62/&quot;&gt;I ended up getting a Thinkpad X62&lt;/a&gt; (an X61 chassis with modern internals). Last September, the maker of the X62 announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/lcdfans/posts/2144170785850022&quot;&gt;a 3rd batch of X210s would be made&lt;/a&gt;. I ordered one and received it in January. China has a bunch of laws that make it hard to move money across borders, so payment involved wiring $1200 to someone’s personal bank account in China, then e-mailing a qq.com address. It was a rather harrowing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://geoff.greer.fm/images/x210.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My X210. Fonts are huge so that you can read screenfetch.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the X62, the X210 is made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/lcdfans&quot;&gt;51NB&lt;/a&gt;, a group of enthusiasts in Shenzhen. The X210 is an X201 chassis with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://ark.intel.com/products/122589/Intel-Core-i7-8550U-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4-00-GHz-&quot;&gt;Core i7 8550u&lt;/a&gt; (4 cores, turbo boost up to 4GHz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2× DDR4 SODIMM slots. I put 32 GB of RAM in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2× mini PCI Express slots. There’s an 802.11/Bluetooth card in one. The other is empty but could be used for LTE or a second wireless card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An M.2 NVMe slot. I put a 2TB SSD in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 3.5” SATA bay. I left it empty, but it’s possible to put a second SSD in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An upgraded screen (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.panelook.com/NV126A1M-N52_BOE_12.6_LCM_overview_28762.html&quot;&gt;12.6 inch, 2880×1920, 450 nits, wide gamut&lt;/a&gt;). The bezel is cut to make room for the 3:2 aspect ratio. There is no webcam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini DisplayPort &amp;amp; VGA out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3× USB 3.1 ports (no USB-C).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SD card reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gigabit ethernet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical switch to toggle Wifi/Bluetooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headphone &amp;amp; microphone jacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal microphone &amp;amp; speakers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X210 is sold as either a motherboard that you install into your own chassis or as a barebones laptop where you bring your own RAM, SSD, and battery. I got the barebones kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-impressions&quot;&gt;My Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slightly prefer the X62’s more compact keyboard, but everything else is much better on the X210. The CPU is over twice as fast and runs cooler. The wifi is faster. The SSD is faster. The screen is &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. it’s a 12.6” screen with a higher resolution than the 15” MacBook Pro. Overall, it’s just plain better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux worked out of the box. I had to install non-free drivers for the Broadcom wireless card, then tweak a few module options to get better power saving. Battery life is a little over 4 hours with the flush battery (55Wh) and 6-7 hours with the extended battery (80Wh). I haven’t finished tweaking all the power saving options, so the lowest idle state is PC3. Battery life would increase by 50% if I got PC6 or PC8 idle states. The fan only turns on if I’m doing something intensive like compiling go or scrolling in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update (2017-03-17): I managed to get PC7 idle by upgrading my kernel to 4.18 and replacing the r8168 module with r8169. Battery life has increased significantly. I now get 6 hours with the flush battery and 10 hours with the extended battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most older Thinkpads, the X210 is easily repaired and upgraded. You can swap the battery in seconds without any tools. If the SSD fails, you can replace it. If the RAM fails, you can replace it. If the wifi card fails, you can replace it. If the screen fails, you can replace it. You can even replace the Trackpoint and the little rubber feet without much trouble. The laptop can be entirely disassembled with two Philips screwheads (#0 and #1). At no point do you encounter tape, glue, or pentalobe screws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The X210 isn’t perfect. It’s made by a group of enthusiasts, not a big company. With that comes some disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like the X62, the mini DisplayPort cannot output in HDMI alternate mode. This means that miniDP→HDMI dongles won’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sometimes notice &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation&quot;&gt;PWM&lt;/a&gt; flicker on the screen. This only happens at the lowest brightness in a dark room when displaying mostly black content. I can see afterimages when my eyes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade&quot;&gt;saccade&lt;/a&gt;, similar to some brake lights at night. It’s about as noticeable as the PWM flicker on my iPhone X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the motherboard breaks, you can’t walk into a store and get it replaced or repaired. Your only recourse is to e-mail the manufacturer and ship it back to China. I’ve only read about one case of this happening, and in that case the motherboard was DOA. The unfortunate user was shipped a new one within a few weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this laptop. It addresses almost all of the issues I had with the X62: better screen, better performance, and better microphone quality. More than anything, the X210 demonstrates just how much potential is being squandered by laptop manufacturers. If a small group in Shenzhen can make this laptop, Lenovo or Apple should be able to build something far better. Instead they make laptops with integrated batteries, fewer ports, soldered RAM, sub-par keyboards, and touchbars. Many professionals want something better.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:hn&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope 51NB continues to build new internals for old chassis, because I doubt the major laptop manufacturers will get their heads out of their asses any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Associations of Cognitive Function with Carbon Dioxide and Ventilation (2016)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/27662232</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Citation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Allen, Joseph G., Piers MacNaughton, Usha Satish, Suresh Santanam, Jose Vallarino, and John D. Spengler. 2015. “Associations of Cognitive Function Scores with Carbon Dioxide, Ventilation, and Volatile Organic Compound Exposures in Office Workers: A Controlled Exposure Study of Green and Conventional Office Environments.” Environmental Health Perspectives 124 (6): 805-812. doi:10.1289/ehp.1510037. http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1510037.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Abstract&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Background: The indoor built environment plays a critical role in our overall well-being because of both the amount of time we spend indoors (~90%) and the ability of buildings to positively or negatively influence our health. The advent of sustainable design or green building strategies reinvigorated questions regarding the specific factors in buildings that lead to optimized conditions for health and productivity. Objective: We simulated indoor environmental quality (IEQ) conditions in “Green” and “Conventional” buildings and evaluated the impacts on an objective measure of human performance: higher-order cognitive function. Methods: Twenty-four participants spent 6 full work days (0900–1700 hours) in an environmentally controlled office space, blinded to test conditions. On different days, they were exposed to IEQ conditions representative of Conventional [high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] and Green (low concentrations of VOCs) office buildings in the United States. Additional conditions simulated a Green building with a high outdoor air ventilation rate (labeled Green+) and artificially elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels independent of ventilation. Results: On average, cognitive scores were 61% higher on the Green building day and 101% higher on the two Green+ building days than on the Conventional building day (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). VOCs and CO2 were independently associated with cognitive scores. Conclusions: Cognitive function scores were significantly better under Green+ building conditions than in the Conventional building conditions for all nine functional domains. These findings have wide-ranging implications because this study was designed to reflect conditions that are commonly encountered every day in many indoor environments.

<title>Suse is once again an independent company</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/suse-is-once-again-an-independent-company/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/suse-is-once-again-an-independent-company/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Open-source infrastructure and application delivery vendor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suse.com/&quot;&gt;Suse&lt;/a&gt; — the company behind one of the oldest Linux distributions — today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suse.com/c/news/suse-completes-move-to-independence-reaffirms-commitment-to-customers-partners-and-open-source-communities-as-industrys-largest-independent-open-source-company/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it is once again an independent company. The company today finalized its $2.5 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suse.com/c/news/suse-partners-with-growth-investor-eqt-to-continue-momentum-strategy-execution-and-product-expansion/&quot;&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; by growth investor EQT from Micro Focus, which itself had acquired it back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few companies have changed hands as often as Suse and yet remained strong players in their business. Suse was first acquired by &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/novell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;novell&quot;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. Novell was then acquired by &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/attachmate-corporation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;attachmate-corporation&quot;&gt;Attachmate&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, which &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/micro-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;micro-focus&quot;&gt;Micro Focus&lt;/a&gt; acquired in 2014. The company then turned Suse into an independent division, only to then announce its sale to &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/eqt-holdings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;eqt-holdings&quot;&gt;EQT&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while for Micro Focus and EQT to finalize the acquisition, though, but now, for the first time since 2004, Suse stands on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micro Focus &lt;a href=&quot;http://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/microfocus/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=108&amp;amp;newsid=1240634&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that when it acquired Attachmate Group for $2.35 billion, Suse generated just 20 percent of the group’s total revenues. Since then, Suse has generated quite a bit more business as it expanded its product portfolio well beyond its core Linux offerings and into the more lucrative open-source infrastructure and application delivery business by, among other things, offering products and support around massive open-source projects like Cloud Foundry, OpenStack and Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-1797808&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;196&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png?resize=50,31 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px&quot;/&gt;Suse CEO Nils Brauckmann will remain at the helm of the company, but the company is shaking up its executive ranks a bit. Enrica Angelone, for example, has been named to the new post of CFO at Suse, and Sander Huyts is now the company’s COO. Former Suse CTO Thomas Di Giacomo is now president of Engineering, Product and Innovation. All three report directly to Brauckmann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our genuinely open, open source solutions, flexible business practices, lack of enforced vendor lock-in and exceptional service are more critical to customer and partner organizations, and our independence coincides with our single-minded focus on delivering what is best for them,” said Brauckmann in today’s announcement. “Our ability to consistently meet these market demands creates a cycle of success, momentum and growth that allows &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/suse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;suse&quot;&gt;SUSE&lt;/a&gt; to continue to deliver the innovation customers need to achieve their digital transformation goals and realize the hybrid and multi-cloud workload management they require to power their own continuous innovation, competitiveness and growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/story/ibm-acquires-red-hat/&quot;&gt;IBM recently bought Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; for $34 billion, though, it remains to be seen how long Suse’s independent future will last. The market for open source is only heating up, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>As Costs Skyrocket, More U.S. Cities Stop Recycling</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Recycling, for decades an almost reflexive effort by American households and businesses to reduce waste and help the environment, is collapsing in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Philadelphia is now burning about half of its 1.5 million residents’ recycling material in an incinerator that converts waste to energy. In Memphis, the international airport still has recycling bins around the terminals, but every collected can, bottle and newspaper is sent to a landfill. And last month, officials in the central Florida city of Deltona faced the reality that, despite their best efforts to recycle, their curbside program was not working and suspended it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those are just three of the hundreds of towns and cities across the country that have canceled recycling programs, limited the types of material they accepted or agreed to huge price increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We are in a crisis moment in the recycling movement right now,” said Fiona Ma, the treasurer of California, where recycling costs have increased in some cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Prompting this nationwide reckoning is China, which until January 2018 had been a big buyer of recyclable material collected in the United States. That stopped when Chinese officials determined that too much trash was mixed in with recyclable materials like cardboard and certain plastics. After that, Thailand and India started to accept more imported scrap, but even they are imposing new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The turmoil in the global scrap markets &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/climate/recycling-landfills-plastic-papers.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;began affecting American communities last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the problems have only deepened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With fewer buyers, recycling companies are recouping their lost profits by charging cities more, in some cases four times what they charged last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amid the soaring costs, cities and towns are making hard choices about whether to raise taxes, cut other municipal services or abandon an effort that took hold during the environmental movement of the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Into the truck in Sunrise. “Recycling has been dysfunctional for a long time,” said Mitch Hedlund, executive director of Recycle Across America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott McIntyre for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Recycling has been dysfunctional for a long time,” said Mitch Hedlund, executive director of Recycle Across America, a nonprofit organization that pushes for more standardized labels on recycling bins to help people better sort material. “But not many people really noticed when China was our dumping ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Perhaps counterintuitively, the big winners appear to be the nation’s largest recyclers, like Waste Management and Republic Services, which are also large trash collectors and landfill owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Recycling had been one of the least lucrative parts of their business, trailing hauling and landfills. Analysts say many waste companies had historically viewed recycling as a “loss leader,” offering the service largely to win over a municipality’s garbage business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That equation is starting to change. While there remains a viable market in the United States for scrap like soda bottles and cardboard, it is not large enough to soak up all of the plastics and paper that Americans try to recycle. The recycling companies say they cannot depend on selling used plastic and paper at prices that cover their processing costs, so they are asking municipalities to pay significantly more for their recycling services. Some companies are also charging customers additional “contamination” fees for recycled material that is mixed in with trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The higher recycling fees, analysts say, will help bolster the largest companies’ already booming businesses. Waste Management reported strong operating profits in 2018, while Republic reported increased revenue driven by its waste business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most of the industry’s landfill increases were driven by economic growth: The more Americans consume, the more garbage they generate. But at least some of the higher volume were recyclables that could not be sold and repurposed, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some municipal leaders say they are growing wary of companies that control virtually every aspect of the waste and recycling system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Are these contamination rates truly high, or is it about benefiting their corporate interest?” asked Mike Ryan, the mayor of Sunrise, Fla. “We can’t afford to have inspectors constantly looking over their shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Sunrise's mayor, Mike Ryan, said of the shift to energy-generating incineration: &quot;It’s not what most people think of as recycling, but it is better than the alternative.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott McIntyre for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Unable to afford the higher costs, Sunrise decided to burn its recycling in a facility that turns waste into energy rather than send it to a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s not what most people think of as recycling, but it is better than the alternative,” Mr. Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For cities like Philadelphia, recycling had long been a point of pride. Over the last decade, Philadelphia went from having one of the lowest recycling rates among big cities to one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When China was buying cardboard and plastics, recycling made money for the city some years. But last year, Philadelphia was hit with an “outrageously high” price increase, a city spokeswoman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The city came up with what it says will be a temporary solution. It identified the neighborhoods with the most contamination in its recycling bins and started sending their material to an incinerator in nearby Chester, Pa. The rest still send their material to a recycling facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The incinerator converts the waste to energy, which can be sold back to the electrical grid, said Carlton Williams, Philadelphia’s streets commissioner. But that has done little to alleviate many residents’ environmental angst and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://amp.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/21/philadelphia-covanta-incinerator-recyclables-china-ban-imports&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concerns about increased air pollution&lt;/a&gt; in Chester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Residents say, ‘You are taking all our recycling efforts, and you are burning it?’” Mr. Williams said. “They hear the word ‘burn’ and they think it is an environmental disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;City officials are working to negotiate a more affordable contract that would restore recycling to all of Philadelphia this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Deltona, higher costs were not the only factor behind the decision last month to stop recycling. Even if the city agreed to pay the additional $25,000 a month that its recycling company was charging, there was no assurance that all the plastic containers and junk mail would be turned into something new, Mayor Heidi Herzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We all did recycling because it was easy, but the reality is that not much was actually being recycled,” Ms. Herzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The troubles with recycling have amplified calls for limiting waste at its source. Measures like banning plastic bags and straws, long pushed by environmental groups, are gaining traction more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;css-79elbk ehw59r11&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The waste-to-energy facility in Davie, Fla. Like Sunrise, Philadelphia is using an incinerator, but for the recycling from only about half its residents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott McIntyre for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This month, a lobbying group for Connecticut municipalities, citing the chaos in local recycling programs, urged the governor to focus on restricting plastic bags, straws and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The sooner we accept the economic impracticality of recycling, the sooner we can make serious progress on addressing the plastic pollution problem,” said Jan Dell, an engineer who leads Last Beach Cleanup. It’s an advocacy group that works with investors and nonprofits to reduce plastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some large waste producers are still going through the motions of recycling, no matter how futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Across Memphis, large commercial enterprises have had to stop recycling for now because of contamination problems. But the airport is keeping its recycling bins in place to preserve “the culture” of recycling among passengers and employees, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We want to ensure that we are able to have a seamless transition if and when single-stream recycling returns to the Memphis area,” the spokesman, Glen Thomas, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Apple Watch detects irregular heart beat in large U.S. study</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-apple/apple-watch-detects-irregular-heart-beat-in-large-u-s-study-idUSKCN1QX0EI</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-apple/apple-watch-detects-irregular-heart-beat-in-large-u-s-study-idUSKCN1QX0EI</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Apple Watch was able to detect irregular heart pulse rates that could signal the need for further monitoring for a serious heart rhythm problem, according to data from a large study funded by Apple Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AAPL.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AAPL.O&quot;&gt;AAPL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), demonstrating a potential future role for wearable consumer technology in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope the technology can assist in early detection of atrial fibrillation, the most common form of irregular heart beat. Patients with untreated AF are five times more likely to have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results of the largest AF screening and detection study, involving over 400,000 Apple Watch users who were invited to participate, were presented on Saturday at the American College of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 400,000 participants, 0.5 percent, or about 2,000 subjects, received notifications of an irregular pulse. Those people were sent an ECG (electrocardiography) patch to wear for subsequent detection of atrial fibrillation episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third of those whose watches detected an irregular pulse were confirmed to have atrial fibrillation using the ECG technology, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 84 percent of the irregular pulse notifications were later confirmed to have been AF episodes, data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The physician can use the information from the study, combine it with their assessment ... and then guide clinical decisions around what to do with an alert,” said Dr. Marco Perez, one of the study’s lead investigators from Stanford School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that 57 percent of participants who received an alert on their watch sought medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Apple, the data provides firepower as it pushes into healthcare. Its new Series 4 Watch, which became available only after the study began so was not used, has the ability to take an electrocardiogram to detect heart problems and required clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the trial, called it an important study as use of this type of wearable technology is only going to become more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study is an important first step in figuring out how can we use these technologies in a way that’s evidence based,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers urged caution by doctors in using data from consumer devices when treating patients. But they also see great future potential for this type of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Atrial fibrillation is just the beginning, as this study opens the door to further research into wearable technologies and how they might be used to prevent disease before it strikes,” said Lloyd Minor, dean of Stanford School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
