<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A few years ago during a break in a leadership class I was teaching, a manager named Michael walked up looking unsettled. His boss had told him he needed to be more productive, so he had spent a few hours analyzing how he spent his time. He had already cut his nonessential meetings. He couldn’t find any tasks to drop from his calendar. He didn’t see an obvious way to do them more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is going to sound like a joke, but it’s not,” he confessed. “My only idea is to drink less water so I don’t have to go to the bathroom so many times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We live in a culture obsessed with personal productivity. We devour books on getting things done and dream of four-hour workweeks. We &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/business/against-hustle-culture-rise-and-grind-tgim.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;worship at the altar of hustle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-people-ask-you-how-stop-saying-busy-robert-glazer/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;boast about being busy&lt;/a&gt;. The key to getting things done, we’re often told, is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/why-time-management-is-ruining-our-lives&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time management&lt;/a&gt;. If you could just plan your schedule better, you could reach productivity nirvana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But after two decades of studying productivity, I’ve become convinced that time management is not a solution — it’s actually part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For most of my career, the most frequent question I’ve gotten is: “How do I get more done?” Sometimes people ask because they know I’m an organizational psychologist, and productivity is one of my areas of expertise. More often they’re asking because they’ve read in a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/magazine/is-giving-the-secret-to-getting-ahead.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article or a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/deep-work-the-secret-to-achieving-peak-productivity/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular book&lt;/a&gt; that I get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the truth is that I don’t feel very productive. I’m constantly falling short of my daily goals for progress, so I’ve struggled to answer the question. It wasn’t until that conversation with Michael that it dawned on me: Being prolific is not about time management. There are a limited number of hours in the day, and focusing on time management just makes us more aware of how many of those hours we waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A better option is attention management: Prioritize the people and projects that matter, and it won’t matter how long anything takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Attention management is the art of focusing on getting things done for the right reasons, in the right places and at the right moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[Like what you’re reading?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/smarter-living?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Sign up here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3af6d647&quot;&gt;O.K., sure, but why shift our focus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;According to conventional wisdom about time management, you’re supposed to set goals for when you want to finish a task. I decided to try it for this article. The target was 1,200 words, so I sat down at 8 a.m. and gave myself three hours, which would allow me to write at the leisurely pace of six words per minute. I then spent the next six minutes writing a grand total of zero words, staring at a flashing cursor. The only task I completed was a Google search of whether the cursor was named in honor of all the writers who have cursed it. (Yes, I know you’re mocking me, you poor blinking excuse for a rectangle.) Then I wondered how many words I actually type per minute and took a typing test. I wasn’t happy with my score, so I took another … and another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Eventually I got frustrated and shifted to attention management. E.B. White once &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/03/lifetimes/white-notes.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.” But in my &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.adamgrant.net/give-and-take&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve found that productive people don’t agonize about which desire to pursue. They go after both simultaneously, gravitating toward projects that are personally interesting and socially meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;So instead of focusing on how quickly I wanted to finish this article, I asked why I agreed to write it in the first place: I might learn something new when synthesizing the research; I’d finally have somewhere to point people when they ask about productivity; and it might help some of those people. That led me to start thinking about specific people who might read this, which reminded me of Michael. Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. Productivity isn’t a virtue. It’s a means to an end. It’s only virtuous if the end is worthy. If productivity is your goal, you have to rely on willpower to push yourself to get a task done. If you pay attention to why you’re excited about the project and who will benefit from it, you’ll be naturally pulled into it by intrinsic motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Erik Winkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-cch8ym&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-5613bb6e&quot;&gt;But how do I stay on task if I’m not worried about time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Attention management also involves noticing where you get things done. I grew up in Michigan, and when I went back there for grad school, I tried to convince a friend from the West Coast to join me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s too cold and gray,” she said after a visit during a snowstorm. She then went off to Stanford. That next Michigan winter was the coldest, grayest season I could remember, and I have never been more productive. There was nothing to do but work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Sure enough, a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-01192-001.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;series of studies&lt;/a&gt; led by Julia Lee (now at Michigan) show that bad weather is good for productivity because we’re less likely to be distracted by the thought of going outside. Researchers found that on days when it rained, Japanese bank employees finished transactions faster, and on days when the weather was bad in America, people were more efficient in correcting spelling errors in an essay. With that in mind, I deliberately waited to start writing this article until the day after a snowstorm, when the melting slush outside my window was not appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;My favorite part of attention management is the &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;. Most of our productivity challenges are with tasks that we don’t want to do but that we need to do. For years, I thought the way to handle those tasks was to do them right after the most interesting tasks so the energy would spill over. Then my colleague Jihae Shin and I ran a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2017.0735&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in a Korean department store and found that when employees had a highly interesting task, they actually performed worse on their most boring tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One possible reason is what’s called &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597809000399&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attention residue&lt;/a&gt;: Your mind keeps wandering back to the interesting task, disrupting your focus on the boring task. But in an experiment with Americans watching videos and then doing a dull data entry task, we found support for a different mechanism: contrast effects. A fascinating or funny video makes the data entry task seem even more excruciating, the same way a sweet dessert makes a sour vegetable taste yuckier. So if you’re trying to power through a boring task, do it after a moderately interesting one, and save your most exciting task as a reward for afterward. It’s not about time; it’s about timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-sbs9ef eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-32a09278&quot;&gt;Of makers and managers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I’m guessing your goal is not just to be more productive — you probably want to be creative, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The stumbling block is that productivity and creativity demand opposite attention management strategies. Productivity is fueled by raising attentional filters to keep unrelated or distracting thoughts out. But creativity is fueled by lowering attentional filters to let those thoughts in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;How do you get the best of both worlds? In his book “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/When-Scientific-Secrets-Perfect-Timing/dp/0735210624&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;When&lt;/a&gt;,” Dan Pink writes about evidence that your circadian rhythm can help you figure out the right time to do your productive and creative work. If you’re a morning person, you should do your analytical work early when you’re at peak alertness; your routine tasks around lunchtime in your trough; and your creative work in the late afternoon or evening when you’re more likely to do nonlinear thinking. If you’re more of a night owl, you might be better off flipping creative projects to your fuzzy mornings and analytical tasks to your clearest-eyed late afternoon and evening moments. It’s not time management, because you might spend the same amount of time on the tasks even after you rearrange your schedule. It’s attention management: You’re noticing the order of tasks that works for you and adjusting accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Paying attention to timing management also means thinking differently about how you plan your work. I love Paul Graham’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; to divide the week into “maker days” and “manager days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On manager days, you hold your meetings and calls. On maker days, you block out time to be productive and creative, knowing you’ll be free from distractions that would normally interrupt your &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Masterminds/dp/0465024114&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, few of us have the luxury to manage every week that way, which means we need to find ways to carve out maker moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Time management says we should eliminate distractions altogether — not just &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-work-takes-over-your-life-adam-grant/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interruptions from other people&lt;/a&gt;, but also the times when we interrupt ourselves. If you’re getting sucked into social media, you’d need to stop cold turkey. Attention management offers an alternative: Be thoughtful about the timing of those distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When I was in middle school, I lost a whole Saturday to watching TV and I felt pretty disgusted with myself afterward. But I didn’t give up TV. I made a rule: I would only turn on the TV if I already knew what I wanted to watch. I’ve adopted the same policy on social media: In times when I could be working, I only log in to share content. I save scrolling for windows when I couldn’t be getting anything done, like waiting for a flight to take off or cooling down after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most of the writers I know wait for maker days to start writing, believing they need at least four or six hours to dig into a big idea or a complex problem. But there’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0741088397014004001&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that binge writers actually get less done than people who write in shorter bursts. You can make meaningful progress in surprisingly small intervals: When graduate students were &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Professors-Writers-Self-Help-Productive-Writing/dp/091350713X/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=boice+professors+as+writers&amp;amp;qid=1550762723&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-1-fkmrnull&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; to write in 15-minute intervals, they finished their dissertations faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If you’re trying to be more productive, don’t analyze how you spend your time. Pay attention to what consumes your attention. I’ve just looked at the clock for the first time since I thought of the story about Michael. It’s 10:36 a.m., and I’ve gone about 500 words over my target. I’ll leave it to you to decide whether the past 156 minutes were a good use of my attention — and whether the past few minutes of reading this were a good use of yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Which brings me to one more thought: I’m pretty sure there’s an eighth habit of highly effective people. They don’t spend all their time reading about the seven habits of highly effective people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;post-image&quot; src=&quot;https://images.iwantmyname.com/blog/electricity-experiement.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of a person experimenting with electricity&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Five years ago, &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2014/05/culture-at-iwmn-part-one&quot;&gt;Lenz (one of our co-founders) wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At iwantmyname everyone earns the same. This sounds strange to many and I get asked a lot of questions how this may work once we grow bigger and the honest answer is: “I don’t know, but so far it works” and I give that same answer since we started 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying idea has two main roots. First, we really think that everyone is as important to the success of our team as anyone else in the team. We don’t believe in a hierarchy or in more important people. If we hire you, we think you are valuable and want you to be part of our team as a level peer, not an underlying that does the stuff no one else wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Soon after, it hit the Hacker News front page, and the &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7713996&quot;&gt;top comment&lt;/a&gt; went as follows (from a person called fishtoaster):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a cool experiment. It’s always neat to see people trying new, weird ways to run a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I would predict the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As the company grows, they have trouble hiring specialists or more senior people, since they’re competing with other companies for those people, but without the flexibility to offer a comparable salary. They could solve this by paying their highest-paid person what they’re worth, and everyone else the same, but that could be prohibitively expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The need will develop for people who, though valuable, are plentiful (e.g., a janitor, but fill in any role here that’s generally near the bottom of the pay scale). The decision will be “We’d really like a janitor, but not enough to pay $X”, where X is their everyone-salary (which has to be high enough to attract their most valuable people). As such, they’ll be hard-pressed to hire roles that aren’t really worth that much to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, you can solve either of those by having more money than you know what to do with. So, if they’re wildly profitable, it’s a system that’ll keep working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s just my prediction, though. I’d love to see a followup blog post in a few years describing how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Well, fishtoaster… this one’s for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;One thing that happened over the last 5-10 years is that people’s idea of what “market rate” is for a remote developer job seems to be shifting to the market rate of San Francisco. And that’s a tough place to play if you A. don’t have beaucoup VC money, B. aren’t sitting on a pile of disposable cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;For instance, according to &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.payscale.com/research/NZ/Job=Software_Developer/Salary/79165fa1/Wellington&quot;&gt;PayScale&lt;/a&gt;, the average software developer in Wellington NZ makes NZ$64k. We pay more than that, but when you become a remote company, people start looking for the $134k USD salary people are making in the top 10% of SF (which seems a bit low to me, but I’ll take their word for it). In one beautiful locale we pay in the top 10%, and in the other, we’re pretty meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;So when fishtoaster says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision will be “We’d really like a janitor, but not enough to pay $X”, where X is their everyone-salary (which has to be high enough to attract their most valuable people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;… I feel that. It’s a legitimate concern. Basically, we’re playing a game where the success of the company hinges on our ability to hire good developers, but we can’t offer top SF rates without shrinking our staff because our operating costs would be too high due to our flat structure. Fortunately for us, we’re competing not only on salary, but freedom, and that shouldn’t be taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;For as much as we hear about greed and people doing anything for money, the truth is that the world is large and full of people with different motivations. We’ve had people in emerging economies mention top-10% SF rates, but we’ve also had people in the more expensive parts of EU work for less because of the lifestyle we can somewhat uniquely offer. For example, I could probably make more in a management role elsewhere, but at iwantmyname, I get to pick my kids up from school every day without fail. To me, that’s worth a whole lot, but to someone else, it might mean very little. We’re all motivated by very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure certain individuals are paid somewhat below market value while others are paid handsomely for their role. This can hurt when hiring employees in the former category. The flat hierarchy, general job benefits, and culture need to make up for the market pay-cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;(Random quotes are from a team poll I did about our one-salary structure. You’ll see them sprinkled throughout.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;For us, everything has mostly worked out — we offer a certain amount, have had little trouble filling job openings, and our turnover is low (and to my knowledge, no one who has ever left did it primarily because of our pay structure). That said, I do feel the pressure of getting us closer to SF-senior-dev competitive wages because recruitment will inevitably get harder if the pay gap becomes too wide. We’ll never be able to pay the top-end salary of a Fortune 500 company under our current structure unless we stumble our way into a mind-blowing new market segment, but we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pull ourselves closer without making non-dev positions unreasonably expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to hire and retain good staff, the amount also needs to be focused on the high end of what’s needed to be competitive. What may be a good salary for support or marketing or whatever &lt;em&gt;elsewhere&lt;/em&gt; may be quite low for good development talent, for example, and people are rarely, or only to a very limited degree, willing to accept a pay cut because they like a company’s culture or the projects they’ll be doing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation and turnover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Turnover is a tricky thing to talk about because it feels like weakness, but it’s impossible to avoid when running a business. And it’s important to know that all companies are working from a different baseline. In a previous life, I worked at an ad agency that somewhat purposefully churned through recent college grads to maximize staff ROI (turns out, cheap labor being client-billed for ~$150/hr is a good way for owners to get rich). That world is different than this world though — clients came and went, onboarding was basically instant because each project was from scratch, and the work was more about immediate impact than retaining institutional knowledge. Turnover there was like watching the seasons change. So it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;In a small tech shop like iwantmyname though, institutional knowledge is everything because nearly nothing is built from the ground up. And onboarding is relatively painful because we don’t have people we can just dedicate to training. Turnover sucks, so we do our best to avoid it. And I think we’ve done a pretty good job. Here’s what our “stats” look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;post-unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;20 total employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;all but four are still involved with the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;all four that left were developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;As I said before, overall retention is good… much better than at any job I’ve had in the past. But while the sample size is small, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a relationship between market rate and turnover. While we have 100% retention for non-developers, our typical dev window is roughly three years (again, small sample size… compounded by the fact that iwantmyname basically didn’t do any hiring for the first five years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Here’s the thing though. Even in Silicon Valley, where salaries are extremely high across the board and employees are showered in benefits, tech &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/average-employee-tenure-retention-at-top-tech-companies-2018-4#tesla-is-in-the-same-league-with-employees-staying-at-the-electric-car-maker-21-years-on-average-tesla-employees-work-famously-long-hours-and-weekends-which-could-explain-the-relatively-early-burnout-3&quot;&gt;retention is low&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t think income is the primary motivator here (although I’m sure it helps with recruiting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;My general theory is that people are motivated by two things in life: pain avoidance and happiness. No matter what you do, you’re always trying to find the thing that brings the most happiness with the least amount of pain. Some people find higher peak happiness through suffering, and some people are hedonists who work to experience minimal pain, but both are operating under the same framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;So what we’re looking at here is a dev vs non-dev marketplace of employees. Every individual is different, but most people find happiness at work through money and perks (remote work, working on stuff you like, freedom to make decisions, etc.). The tangle is that in this market, non-devs tend to experience pain while looking for jobs, while even mediocre devs routinely get contacted by recruiters offering ++ salaries and signing bonuses. There’s no friction for a developer, and without friction, there’s no pain. So as soon as things lose their shine, stats show that developers tend to move on. And it’s understandable — why stagnate when there are endless opportunities to do new and interesting things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;From a management perspective, all I can do is optimize the things I can control to reduce pain. Here are the three things I focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;post-ordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freedom&lt;/strong&gt;. The worst part of being in a traditional office is seeing how fast your calendar gets booked. Endless meetings, pointless team-building activities, random reporting reminders to make middle managers happy. Some of it is useful, but I do my very best to clear up people’s schedules so they can maximize their time not working. To me, the ideal workplace is one that lets me enjoy my own life… not one that tries to merge with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dysfunction&lt;/strong&gt;. People tend to not like dysfunction, and dysfunction is really just a symptom of not understanding priorities. Yes, some people are just lazy, but if you can solve laziness, the best thing a manager can do is to be extraordinarily clear about the work ahead. Generally, if you can get smart people to work towards the same goals while avoiding institutional confusion, they’ll achieve great things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fairness&lt;/strong&gt;. The other thing people tend to not like is the feeling that their peers aren’t holding up their end of the bargain. And it’s especially bad when the person telling the team what to do isn’t doing anything themselves. The best way to make this a non-issue is to get dirty from the top-down. No one is above the rest — not even managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-salary makes everyone feel they are an equal part of the team. Whether they’re in support, dev, or product areas, all have an equal voice. That equality helps avoid the “that’s above my pay grade, let someone else deal with it” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;post-blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A completely flat structure) negates the need for traditional performance reviews and salary negotiation, which are very difficult for some people and do not favour those who have not been raised/trained/educated to advocate and negotiate hard for themselves. (And can be actively penalized for it, in the cases of some demographics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a better way?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;When I talk about our flat salary, I often come at it from the angle of focusing on what alternatives would buy us. Barring a cash infusion, we have X dollars that can be allocated however we want. Right now we know precisely how much each position costs (because we all cost the same), but if we moved off our flat structure, what would that look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;My best guess is that developer rates would go up, support rates would go down, and everyone else would be roughly the same. But it’s not like rates would change proportionally. At best it’s a wash, with support rates going down exactly the same as developer rates are going up, but that’s silly. SF rates for senior devs would cost far more than the savings we’d make on the support side, and the talent drain in support would make for a far inferior product. Plus, our support staff does a lot more than their direct tasks — they’re worth every penny they get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;In reality, our flat-salary has probably allowed the company to grow faster than it would’ve under a traditional structure. I don’t think that was the intention going in, but it’s essentially put a movable ceiling on rates that have increased exponentially since we started around the 2008 recession. Our salaries are tied to profit, and while they’ve gone up over time, they just don’t compare to the whims of a company tied to an &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/chart?p=GOOG&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch#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%253D&quot;&gt;out-of-control market&lt;/a&gt; or VC-infused debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;To me (and to be clear, I’m part of the flat salary with no ownership stake), it’s a fair deal because everything was on the table from day one. Everyone makes X, there’s no excessive Apple-esque cash hoard that’s being syphoned to investors instead of the staff, and we’re free to leave at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;With that said, if we were to change, here are three models that seem acceptable (all have pros and cons):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;post-ordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;From an employee standpoint, the Basecamp model is a good way to maximize the retention and recruitment of “senior” talent while mostly keeping out the ugly popularity contests that come with salary negotiations. My understanding based on my recollection of the book &lt;a class=&quot;post-link&quot; href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/books/calm&quot;&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work&lt;/a&gt; is that hey pay an upper-tier salary &lt;em&gt;per position&lt;/em&gt; based (I think) on SF rates. They also use a junior/senior tier, which allows them to recruit raw talent without worrying about fair workloads (it’s be hard to justify paying the same salary to two devs who have vastly different levels of experience, but there’s also a lot of “grunt work” that needs to be done that might drive a senior person away).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;This one was floated by someone in the internal survey: &lt;em&gt;”A possible solution to retaining talent longer term (who may start looking to move on for financial reasons) is to add a ‘years with the company’ accelerator. Putting the fiscal focus on retaining experience and talent seems more logical to me than hiring a ‘rockstar’ candidate and offering them double their colleague’s salary so they can shoot through some work and leave in a year or two.’’&lt;/em&gt; I generally like this, but it would probably have to be capped at some amount to avoid paying people too far above market rates. While retention is important, I don’t know if it’d make business sense to, say, pay someone triple what a comparable replacement would cost. And you don’t want to be in the position of laying off a tenured staffer because you mistakenly started paying them too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;post-list-item&quot;&gt;I’m not sure how the accounting would work, but if we kept the salary the same and tied it to a quarterly bonus structure based on company profits, it could create a more direct link between short-term productivity and income. (That’s not really a fundamental change though… more like a nudge.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;Anyways, fishtoaster, here we are — getting by with a system that’s held up strong for ten years. We don’t have “more money than we know what to do with” (YET!!!), but I think everyone would agree that iwantmyname sits in the successful column of small businesses. And to me, that’s a win in the one-salary column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;I’ll make a note on my calendar to update this in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Serenity: x86 Unix-like operating system for IBM PC-compatibles</title>
<link>https://github.com/awesomekling/serenity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/awesomekling/serenity</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x86 Unix-like operating system for IBM PC-compatibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wondered what it would be like to write my own operating system, but I never took it seriously. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've grown tired of cutesy and condescending software that doesn't take itself or the user seriously. This is my effort to bring back the feeling of computing I once knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, the goal here is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix. This is a system by me, for me, based on the things I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Screenshot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomekling/serenity/master/Meta/screenshot-cdb82f6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomekling/serenity/master/Meta/screenshot-cdb82f6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot as of cdb82f6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-emptive multitasking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compositing window server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPv4 networking with ARP, TCP, UDP and ICMP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ext2 filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unix-like libc and userland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mmap()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/proc filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local sockets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pseudoterminals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event-driven GUI library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS lookup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other stuff I can't think of right now...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do I build and run this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a freestanding cross-compiler for the i686-elf target (for the kernel) and another cross-compiler for the i686-pc-serenity target (for all the userspace stuff.) It's probably possible to coerce it into building with vanilla gcc/clang if you pass all the right compiler flags, but I haven't been doing that for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a helpful guide on building a GCC cross-compiler&lt;/a&gt; on the OSDev wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only tested this on an Ubuntu 18.10 host with GCC 8.2.0, so I'm not sure it works anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to run it, here's how you'd get it to boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cd Kernel
./makeall.sh
./run            # Runs in QEMU
./run b          # Runs in bochs (limited networking support)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undecided. Probably something close to 2-clause BSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;ALBANY — New York State lawmakers have agreed to impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, changing a way of life for millions of New Yorkers as legislators seek to curb an unsightly and omnipresent source of litter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plan, proposed a year ago by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, would be the second statewide ban, after California, which banned bags &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/plastics/carryoutbags&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;New York’s ban, which would begin next March, would forbid stores to provide customers with single-use plastic bags, which are nonbiodegradable and have been blamed for everything from causing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/dead-sperm-whale-filled-with-plastic-trash-indonesia/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gruesome wildlife deaths&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-plastic-bag-ban-recycling-0731-biz-20150730-story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thwarting recycling efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ban, which is expected to be part of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/nyregion/budget-new-york-congestion-pricing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the state’s budget bills that are slated to be passed by Monday&lt;/a&gt;, would have a number of carveouts, including food takeout bags used by restaurants, bags used to wrap deli or meat counter products and bags for bulk items. Newspaper bags would also be exempted, as would garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plan would have an additional element allowing counties to opt in to a 5-cent fee on paper bags, revenue that would go to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund as well as a separate fund to buy reusable bags for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement released late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo said that “these bags have blighted our environment and clogged our waterways,” adding that the plan agreed to in Albany would be a way to “protect our natural resources for future generations of New Yorkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Supporters said that such a two-pronged approach — paper and plastic — was necessary not only to limit the flow of litter into the state’s streets, streams and oceanfront, but also to minimize the greenhouse emissions caused by their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There was a real understanding that there should be a ban on plastic,” said Todd Kaminsky, a Democratic state senator from Nassau County, who is the chairman of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/todd-kaminsky&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;environmental conservation committee&lt;/a&gt;. “And that if people go to paper rather than reusables, we are not that better off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The news of the agreement between Mr. Cuomo and his legislative counterparts comes less than a year after a similar effort stalled as a result of opposition from Republicans, who led the Senate, and from a rogue Democratic senator, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who collaborated with the Republicans. That political dynamic changed in November, when Democrats won eight seats in the Senate, sweeping themselves back into the majority and rendering Mr. Felder’s opinion moot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ban also marks an evolution for Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, who in 2017 signed a bill that effectively &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/nyregion/cuomo-blocks-new-york-city-plastic-bag-law.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;killed a New York City law&lt;/a&gt; that would have imposed a 5-cent fee on plastic bags. The New York City fee had also been opposed by some in the State Assembly, which has been dominated by Democrats, who worried that the fee would act as a regressive tax on poor consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As outlined, however, the plan to allow counties to avoid fees on paper bags would seemingly address those concerns. But that provision also left some environmental advocates disappointed; they argue that by not mandating a paper-bag fee, many people will simply use paper bags instead of reusable bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Peter Iwanowicz, the executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, said the provision to make paper-bag fees optional made the proposed plan “a weak response to the scourge of disposable bags.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“New York had a chance to show real leadership and came up short,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The agreement was also being criticized by business and trade groups, including the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, which represents grocery stores, a major target of such bans and fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mike Durant, the group’s president, said the proposed law would “have a drastic impact on retailers,” and predicted confusion because of the opt-in provision. Mr. Durant also criticized the allocation of paper-bag fee revenue to the environmental and bag funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The failure to give even a portion of the 5-cent fee back to the stores, makes this an untenable mandate for many of our members who operate within finite profit margins,” said Mr. Durant. He added, “We are disappointed that the Legislature did not consider this alternative and failed to hear the concerns of the business community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Small business groups also expressed concern. “Every mandated cost increase adds up,” said Greg Biryla, the New York director of National Federation of Independent Business. “Independent businesses are simply not able to absorb and adjust to new mandated costs the same as their big-box competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though such laws have been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/litigation&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the subject of lawsuits in the past&lt;/a&gt;, several cities and other localities have imposed fees on single-use carryout bags, including Suffolk County, where such a plan led to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newsday.com/business/suffolk-nickel-plastic-bag-fee-reusable-1.24755898&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a sharp reduction&lt;/a&gt; in their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Such a disincentive is also the goal of the state plan, said Mr. Kaminsky, whose hometown, Long Beach, N.Y., has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.longbeachny.gov/?SEC=CDED59DF-3AFA-4D0B-A23D-389A7FB9C74A&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;such a program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think we’ll look back in a few years,” he said. “And people will wonder why we didn’t do this sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>PHP 8 to Add a JIT</title>

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Fig 1. A chap performing the Detroit JIT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Unless you have been living under a rock, or are from the past (in which case, welcome), you will be aware that a JIT is coming to PHP 8: The vote ended, quietly, today, with a vast majority in favour of merging into PHP 8, so, it's official.&lt;p&gt;Throw some crazy shapes in celebration, suggestion given in Fig 1, and it's even called &quot;The (Detroit) JIT&quot; ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now sit down and read the following myth busting article, we're going to clear up some confusion around what the JIT is, what it will benefit, and delve into how it works (but only a little, because I don't want you to be bored).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I don't know who I'm talking to, I'm going to start at the beginning with the simple questions and work up to the complex ones, if you already are sure you know the answer to the question in a heading, you can skip that part ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is JIT ?&lt;/h3&gt;
PHP implements a virtual machine, a kind of virtual processor - we call it Zend VM. PHP compiles your human readable script into instructions that the virtual machine understands (we call them opcodes), this stage of execution is what we refer to as &quot;Compile Time&quot;. At the &quot;Runtime&quot; stage of execution the virtual machine (Zend VM) executes your code's instructions (opcodes).&lt;p&gt;This all works very well, and tools like APC (in the past) and OPCache (today) cache your code's instructions (opcodes) so that &quot;Compile Time&quot; only happens when it must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, one line to explain what JIT is in general: Just-in-time is a compiler strategy that takes an intermediate representation of code and turns it into architecture dependent machine code at runtime - just-in-time for execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PHP, this means that the JIT treats the instructions generated for the Zend VM as the intermediate representation and emits architecture dependent machine code, so that the host of your code is no longer the Zend VM, but your CPU directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why does PHP need a JIT ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The focus of the PHP internals community since slightly before PHP 7.0 has been performance, brought about by healthy competition from Facebook's HHVM project. The majority of the core changes in PHP 7.0 were contained in the PHPNG patch, which improved significantly the way in which PHP utilizes memory and CPU at its core, since then every one of us has been forced to keep one eye on performance.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Since PHP 7.0 some performance improvements have been made, optimizations for the HashTable (a core data structure for PHP), specializations in the Zend VM for certain opcodes, specializations in the compiler for certain sequences, and a constant stream of improvements to the Optimizer component of OPCache ... and many others besides, too boring to list.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It's a brute fact that these optimizations can only take us so far and we are rapidly approaching, or maybe have already met, a brick wall in our ability to improve it any further.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Caveat: When we say things like &quot;we can't improve it any further&quot;, what we really mean is, &quot;the trade-offs we would have to make to improve it any further no longer look appealing&quot; ... whenever we talk about performance optimizations, we're talking about trade-offs. Often, trade-offs in simplicity for performance. We would all like to think that the simplest code is the fastest code, but that simply is not the case in the modern world of C programming. The fastest code is often that code which is prepared to take advantage of architecture dependent intrinsics or platform (compiler) dependent builtins. Simplicity just is not a guarantee of the best performance ...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;At this time, the ability for PHP to JIT would appear to be the best way to squeeze more performance from PHP.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will the JIT make my website faster ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In all probability, not significantly.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Maybe not the answer you were expecting: In the general case, applications written in PHP are I/O bound, and JIT works best on CPU bound code.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What on earth does &quot;I/O and CPU bound&quot; mean ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When we want to describe the general performance characteristics of a piece of code, or an application, we use the terms I/O bound and CPU bound.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In the simplest possible terms:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An I/O bound piece of code would go faster if we could improve (reduce, optimize) the I/O it is doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CPU bound piece of code would go faster if we could improve (reduce, optimize) the instructions the CPU is executing - or (magically) increase the clock speed of the CPU :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;A piece of code, or an application, may be I/O bound, CPU bound, or bound equally to CPU and I/O.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In general, PHP applications tend to be I/O bound - the thing that is slowing them down is the I/O which they are performing - connecting, reading, and writing to databases, caches, files, sockets and so on.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does CPU bound PHP look like ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;CPU bound code is not something a lot of PHP programmers will be familiar with, because of the nature of most PHP applications - their job tends to be connect to some database, and or possibly a cache, do some light lifting and spit out an html/json/xml response.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You may look around your codebase and find lots of code that has nothing whatever to do with I/O, code that is calling functions completely disconnected from I/O even, and be confused that I seem to be implying that this doesn't make your application CPU bound, even though there may be many more lines of code that deal with non I/O than I/O.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;PHP is actually quite fast, it's one of the fastest interpreted languages in the world. There is no remarkable difference between the Zend VM calling a function that has nothing to do with I/O, and making the same call in machine code. There is clearly &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; difference, but the fact is that machine code has a calling convention, and Zend VM has a calling convention, machine code has a prologue and Zend VM has a prologue: Whether you call some_c_level_function() in Zend Opcodes or machine code doesn't make a significant difference to the performance of the application making the call - although it may seem to make a significant difference to that call.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A calling convention is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(roughly)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; a sequence of instructions executed *before* entering into another function, a prologue is a sequence of instructions executed *at entry* into another function: The calling convention in both cases pushes arguments onto the stack, and the prologue pops them off the stack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;What about loops, and tail calls and X I hear you ask: PHP is actually quite smart, with the Optimizer component of OPCache enabled your code is transformed as if by magic into the most efficient form you could have written.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It's important to note now that JIT doesn't change the calling convention of Zend Functions from the convention established by the VM - Zend must be able to switch between JIT and VM modes at any time and so the decision was taken to retain the calling convention established by the VM. As a result those calls that you see everywhere aren't remarkably faster when JIT'd.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;If you want to see what CPU bound PHP code looks like, look in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/bench.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zend/bench.php&lt;/a&gt; ... This is obviously an extreme example of CPU bound code, but it should drive home the point that where the JIT really shines is in the area of mathematics.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Did PHP make the ultimate trade-off to make math faster ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. We did it to widen the scope of PHP, and considerably so. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Without wanting to toot our own horn, we have the web covered - If you are a web programmer in 2019 and you haven't considered using PHP for your next project, then you are doing the web wrong - in this very biased PHP developer's opinion.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;To improve the ability to execute math faster in PHP seems, at a glance, to be a very narrow scope. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, this in fact opens the door on things such as machine learning, 3d rendering, 2d (gui) rendering, and data analysis, to name just a few.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why can't we have this in PHP 7.4 ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I just called the JIT &quot;the ultimate trade-off&quot;, and I think it is: It's arguably one of the most complex compiler strategies ever invented, maybe the most complex. To introduce a JIT is to introduce considerable complexity.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;If you ask Dmitry (the author of the JIT) if he made PHP complex, he would say &quot;No, I hate complexity&quot; (that's a direct quote).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;At bottom, complex is &lt;em&gt;anything we do not understand&lt;/em&gt;, and at the moment, there are very few internals developers (less than a handful) that truly understand the implementation of JIT that we have.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;PHP 7.4 is coming up fast, merging into PHP 7.4 would leave us with a version of PHP that less than a handful of people could debug, fix, or improve (in any real sense). This is just not an acceptable situation for those people that voted no on merging into PHP 7.4.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In the time between now and PHP 8, many of us will be working in our spare time to understand the JIT: We still have features we want to implement and tools we need to rewrite for PHP 8, and first we must understand the JIT. We need this time, and are very grateful that a majority of voters saw fit to give it to us.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Complex is not synonymous with horrible: Complex can be beautiful, like a nebula, and the JIT is that kind of complex. You can, in principle, fully understand something complex and only make a marginal reduction in the apparent complexity of that thing. In other words, even when there are 20 internals developers who are as familiar with the JIT as Dmitry is, it doesn't really change the complex nature of JIT.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will development of PHP slow down ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There's no reason to think that it will. We have enough time that we can say with confidence that by the time PHP 8 is generally available, there will be enough of us familiar with the JIT to function at least as well as we do today when it comes to fixing bugs and pushing PHP forward.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;When trying to square this with the view that a JIT is inherently complex, consider that the majority of our time spent on introducing new features is actually spent discussing that feature. For the majority of features, and even fixes, code may take in the order of minutes or hours to write, and discussions take in the order of weeks or months. In rare cases, the code for a feature may take in the order of hours or days to write, but the discussion will always take longer in those rare cases.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;That's all I have to say about that ... &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Enjoy your weekend.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Intel VISA Exploit Gives Access to Computer’s Entire Data, Researchers Show</title>
<link>https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/intel-visa-sa-00086-exploit-researchers-computer-data-access-2014854</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/intel-visa-sa-00086-exploit-researchers-computer-data-access-2014854</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have discovered a previously unknown feature in the Intel chipsets, which could allow an attacker to intercept data from the computer memory. The feature called Intel Visualization of Internal Signals Architecture (Intel VISA) is said to be a utility that is bundled by the chipmaker for testing on the manufacturing lines. Although Intel doesn't publicly disclose the existence of Intel VISA and is extremely secretive about it, the researchers were able to find several ways to enable the feature on the Intel chipsets and capture the data from the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a per presentation made by the researchers Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy of Positive Technologies at the ongoing Blackhat Asia 2019 conference in Singapore, their exploits of the Intel chipsets don't require any hardware modifications or special equipment. One of the techniques shared by the researchers involved vulnerabilities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; in Intel-SA-00086 advisory that give access to Intel Management Engine (Intel ME), in turn helping enable VISA. Access to Intel VISA makes the computer's entire data vulnerable and obtainable for the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel underplayed the exploit and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/researchers-discover-and-abuse-new-undocumented-feature-in-intel-chipsets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; ZDNet that the VISA issue requires physical access to the machines and the Intel-SA-00086 vulnerabilities have already been mitigated. The researchers however disagreed with Intel's comments and reportedly said in an online discussion that the patched Intel firmware can be downgraded using Intel ME, making the chipset vulnerable and opening the door for accessing Intel VISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Ermolov also noted that the vulnerabilities detailed in Intel-SA-00086 are just one of the ways to access VISA, and there are other methods as well, including Orange Mystery and Intel JTAG password. The technical details of these exploits can be found in the presentation slides &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.blackhat.com/asia-19/Thu-March-28/bh-asia-Goryachy-Ermolov-Intel-Visa-Through-the-Rabbit-Hole.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; on Blackhat Asia website.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On Being a Free Software Maintainer</title>
<link>https://feaneron.com/2019/03/28/on-being-a-free-software-maintainer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://feaneron.com/2019/03/28/on-being-a-free-software-maintainer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Year is 2013. I learn about a new, alpha-quality project called “GNOME Calendar.” Intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cool, I’ll track that,” said my younger self. Heavy development was happening at the &lt;em&gt;ui-rework&lt;/em&gt; branch. Every day, a few new commits. Pull, build, test. Except one day, no new commits. Nor the next day. Or week. Or month. Or year. I’m disappointed. Didn’t want that project to die. You know…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nope. Not gonna happen,” also said my younger self. Clone, build, fix bugs, send patches. Maintainer’s interest in the project is renewed. We get a new icon, things get serious. We go to a new IRC room (!) and make the first public release of GNOME Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year passes, it is now 2015. After contributing for more than a year, Erick made me the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; GNOME Calendar maintainer ¹. A mix of positive emotions flows: proud of the achievement; excitement for being able to carry on with my ideas for the future of the application; fear, for the weight of the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But heck, I am a free software maintainer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was 4 years ago. Time passes, things happen, experience is built. Experience that differs from what I originally expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a free software maintainer is a funny place to find yourself in. Good things came from it. Bad things too. Also terrible. And weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, there is a strong sense of achievement when you, well, achieve maintainership of a project. Usually, getting there requires a large number of interactions during a long period of time. It means you are trusted. It means you are trustworthy. It means you are skilled enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also usually means stronger community bonds. Getting to know excellent people, that know a lot and are willing to share and mentor and help, is a life-changing experience. There is a huge human value in being surrounded by great people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who enjoy coding, hooray! Full plate. Planning releases, coding and doing reviews can be fun too. You will fix problems, find solutions, think and design your code. There is a plethora of problems to fix in this plane of existence, and you have the chance to independently fix a few of them by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people. There are good people in this planet. You eventually will receive a thank you email, or you will be paid a coffee. One way or another, people find their way to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People really do find their way to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, sometimes the software you maintain, well, it crashes. It may lose someone’s data. Someone may trigger a unique condition inside the code that you never managed to do. These people may get angry, sad, and frustrated ².&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; find their way to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be demanded to fix your software. You will be shouted. Sometimes, the line may be crossed, and you will be abused. “How dare you not (&lt;em&gt;use your free time to&lt;/em&gt;) fix this ultra high priority bug that is affecting me?” or “This is an absolutely basic feature! How is it not implemented yet (&lt;em&gt;by you on your free time&lt;/em&gt;)?!” or even “You made me move to Software Y, and you need to win me back” are going to be realities you will have to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may get emotional about your code. You may feel ashamed of what you did, and do. After all, your code has bugs, there are numerous issues opened at your bug tracker, and people are complaining non-stop. (Oh and, naturally, there will be someone who will try their best to put you down with that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, you will look at your issue backlog and feel a subtle despair when realise you won’t ever be able to fix all the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are open to review other people’s contributions, there is a high change you will find challengers disguised as contributors. And your code review will be treated as an intellectual battle between good and evil. And you will need to explain and clarify over and over, and deal with circular logic, and pretty much any tool people might use to win battles instead of improving their code. And that is incredibly tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be told that &lt;em&gt;you need to develop a thick skin&lt;/em&gt;. To ignore that, let it go, think positive and don’t pay attention to all the shit that is being thrown at you and why are you so goddamn negative you’re a maintainer for christ sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not feel the joy of working on what you work anymore. You may want to move on. You may also not do that due to the sense of responsibility that you have to your code, your community, and the people who use your software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, being a free software maintainer may have a high price to your psychological and emotional health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I certainly did not know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;¹ – And by “maintainer”, I am talking about being an upstream code maintainer, not package maintainer.&lt;br/&gt;² – Rightfully so. Nobody wants to lose their stuff, or have their workflow broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wpcnt&quot;&gt;

<title>Bezos Investigation Says the Saudis Obtained His Private Data</title>
<link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For 40 years, I’ve advised at-risk public figures and government agencies on high-stakes security matters. My career has included working with the CIA, FBI, at the Reagan White House, counseling foreign leaders, and advising on controversial murder cases. I’ve seen a lot. And yet, I’ve recently seen things that have surprised even me, such as the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; parent company, AMI, being in league with a foreign nation that’s been actively trying to harm American citizens and companies, including the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. You know him as Jeff Bezos; I know him as my client of 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand where this story goes, some background is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; published a special edition that revealed an intimate relationship Bezos was having. He asked me to learn who provided his private texts to the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, and why. My office quickly identified the person whom the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; had paid as a source: a man named &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7&quot;&gt;Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, the now-estranged brother of Lauren Sanchez, whom Bezos was dating. What was unusual, very unusual, was how hard AMI people worked to publicly reveal their source’s identity. First through strong hints they gave to me, and later through direct statements, AMI practically pinned a “kick me” sign on Michael Sanchez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was not the White House, it was not Saudi Arabia,” a company lawyer said on national television, before telling us more: “It was a person that was known to both Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.” In case even more was needed, he added, “Any investigator that was going to investigate this knew who the source was,” a very helpful hint since the name of who was being investigated had been made public 10 days earlier in a &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe&quot;&gt;Daily Beast report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much was made about a recent front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, fingering Michael Sanchez as the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; source—but that information was first published almost seven weeks ago by The Daily Beast, after “multiple sources inside AMI” told The Daily Beast the exact same thing. The actual news in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; article was that its reporters were able to confirm a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/brother-of-jeff-bezos-girlfriend-admits-a-deal-with-national-enquirer&quot;&gt;claim Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; had been making: It was &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-national-enquirer-got-bezos-texts-it-paid-200-000-to-his-lovers-brother-11552953981&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; who first contacted Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; about the affair, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMI has repeatedly &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/business/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-amazon-hollywood.html&quot;&gt;insisted they had only one source&lt;/a&gt; on their Bezos story, but the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; began conversations with Michael Sanchez, they had “already been investigating whether Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez were having an affair.” Michael Sanchez has since confirmed to Page Six that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; contacted him back in July, they had already “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagesix.com/2019/03/30/this-was-real-lauren-sanchezs-brother-tells-all-on-bezos-romance/?_ga=2.164107583.1694089182.1553909345-326982824.1534253864&quot;&gt;seen text exchanges&lt;/a&gt;” between the couple. If accurate, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and Page Six stories would mean, clearly and obviously, that &lt;em&gt;the initial information came from other channels—another source or method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[On Sunday, AMI issued a statement insisting that “it was Michael Sanchez who tipped the National Enquirer off to the affair on Sept. 10, 2018, and over the course of four months provided all of the materials for our investigation.” &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/national-enquirer-says-saudis-didnt-help-on-bezos-story&quot;&gt;Read the full statement here&lt;/a&gt;. -- ed.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bezos directed me to ‘spend whatever is needed’ to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it. That investigation is now complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is complicated, and can’t always be boiled down to a simple narrative like “the brother did it,” even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid, and even when that brother is an associate of Roger Stone and Carter Page. Though interesting, it turns out those truths are also too simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did AMI’s people work so hard to identify a source, and insist to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and others that he was their sole source for everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best answer is contained in what happened next: AMI threatened to publish embarrassing photos of Jeff Bezos unless certain conditions were met. (These were photos that, for some reason, they had held back and not published in their first story on the Bezos affair, or any subsequent story.) While a brief summary of those terms has been made public before, others that I’m sharing are new—and they reveal a great deal about what was motivating AMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eight-page contract AMI sent for me and Bezos to sign would have required that I make a public statement, composed by them and then widely disseminated, saying that my investigation had concluded they hadn’t relied upon “any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their news-gathering process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note here that I’d never publicly said anything about electronic eavesdropping or hacking—and they wanted to be sure I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also wanted me to say our investigation had concluded that their Bezos story was not “instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise.” External forces? Such a strange phrase. AMI knew these statements did not reflect my conclusions, because I told AMI’s Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard (in a 90-minute recorded phone call) that what they were asking me to say about external forces and hacking “is not my truth,” and would be “just echoing what you are looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Indeed, an earlier set of their proposed terms included AMI making a statement “affirming that it undertook no electronic eavesdropping in connection with its reporting and has no knowledge of such conduct”—but now they wanted me to say that for them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract further held that if Bezos or I were ever in our lives to “state, suggest or allude to” anything contrary to what AMI wanted said about electronic eavesdropping and hacking, then they could publish the embarrassing photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this today because it’s exactly what the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; scheme was intended to prevent me from doing. Their contract also contained terms that would have inhibited both me and Bezos from initiating a report to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things didn’t work out as they hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the terms for avoiding publication of personal photos were presented to Jeff Bezos, he responded immediately: “No thank you.” Within hours, he wrote an essay describing his reasons for rejecting AMI’s threatening proposal. Then he &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f&quot;&gt;posted it all on Medium&lt;/a&gt;, including AMI’s actual emails and their salacious descriptions of private photos. (After the Medium post, AMI put out a limp statement saying it “believed fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues Bezos raised in his Medium post have nothing whatsoever to do with Michael Sanchez, any more than revealing the name of a low-level Watergate burglar sheds light on the architects of the Watergate cover-up. Bezos was not expressing concerns about the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; original story; he was focused on what he called “extortion and blackmail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Bezos directed me to “spend whatever is needed” to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investigation is now complete. As has been reported elsewhere, my results have been turned over to federal officials. Since it is now out of my hands, I intend today’s writing to be my last public statement on the matter. Further, to respect officials pursuing this case, I won’t disclose details from our investigation. I am, however, comfortable confirming one key fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information. As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not reach our conclusions lightly. The inquiry included a broad array of resources: investigative interviews with current and former AMI executives and sources, extensive discussions with top Middle East experts in the intelligence community, leading cybersecurity experts who have tracked Saudi spyware, discussions with current and former advisers to President Trump, Saudi whistleblowers, people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), people who work with his close associate Saud al-Qahtani, Saudi dissidents, and other targets of Saudi action, including writer/activist &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.arabtyrantmanual.com/&quot;&gt;Iyad el-Baghdadi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts with whom we consulted confirmed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports on the Saudi capability to “collect vast amounts of previously inaccessible data from smartphones in the air without leaving a trace—including phone calls, texts, emails”—and confirmed that hacking was a key part of the Saudis’ “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html&quot;&gt;extensive surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately led to the killing of [&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;] journalist Jamal Khashoggi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans will be surprised to learn that the Saudi government has been intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudi campaign against Bezos has already been reported by &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business&quot;&gt;CNN International&lt;/a&gt;, Bloomberg, &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-saudis-made-jeff-bezos-public-enemy-1&quot;&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia attacks people in many ways, obviously, including through their &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;elaborate social media program&lt;/a&gt; that uses sophisticated technology and paid surrogates to create artificially trending hashtags. To give you an idea of how this program has infected the U.S., the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that the Saudis &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;even had an operative inside Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which fired the suspect employee, and later advised select activists and others that “your Twitter account is one of a small group of accounts that may have been targeted by state-sponsored actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the Saudi government &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business/video/playlists/business-jeff-bezos/&quot;&gt;unleashed its cyberarmy&lt;/a&gt; on Bezos (and later me). Their multi-pronged campaign included public calls for boycotts against Amazon.com and its Saudi subsidiary, Souq.com. Just three examples among thousands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BlockQuote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BlockQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;10.861016949153&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Mobiledoc&quot; readability=&quot;17.196610169492&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We as Saudis will never accept to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aadelljaber/status/1059178591567728640&quot;&gt;attacked by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, only to buy products from Amazon and Souq.com by night! Strange that all three companies are owned by the same Jew who attacks us by day, and sells us products by night!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our weapon is to boycott… because the owner of the newspaper is the same as their owner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yhya_jaber/status/1065352725750259712&quot;&gt;We're after you - the Jew&lt;/a&gt;, worshipper of money, will go bankrupt by the will of God at the hands of Saudi Arabia... the owner of Amazon and Souq is the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is the spiteful Jew who insults us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezos is not Jewish, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied the well-documented and close relationship between MBS and AMI chairman, David Pecker. That alliance includes David Pecker &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/media/david-pecker-trump-saudi-arabia.html&quot;&gt;bringing MBS intermediary&lt;/a&gt; Kacy Grine to a private White House meeting with President Trump and Jared Kushner. Pecker has also traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with the Crown Prince. Though we don’t know what was discussed in those private meetings, AMI’s actions afterwards are telling. To coincide with MBS’ March 2018 U.S. tour, AMI created a 100-page, ad-free, glossy magazine called &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-publisher-pal-puts-saudi-propaganda-magazine-in-us-supermarkets&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since MBS wasn’t yet a notorious figure in the West (this was before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi), AMI’s magazine introduced him to Americans as “the most influential Arab leader—transforming the world at 32,” and “improving lives of his people &amp;amp; hopes for peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press reported that AMI sent &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;an advance digital copy&lt;/a&gt; of their laudatory magazine to the Saudi Embassy three weeks before printing and distributing 200,000 issues. (Despite AP’s substantial forensic evidence, the kingdom denied it received the magazine’s content in advance. While we’re on denials, the kingdom says Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with the Bezos matter. The kingdom also says MBS had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When AMI publicly insisted that nobody outside of their executives and editors “had any influence on this publication or its content,” I guess they meant other than Kacy Grine, the very same MBS intermediary Pecker had brought to The White House. I say that because AMI soon had to disclose to the Department of Justice National Security Division that their mystery magazine included content written by Grine, and that they also gave him the whole working draft for advance review, and that he suggested changes, and that they implemented his changes, and that he provided better photographs of MBS. With friends like AMI, you don’t need… publicists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My firm has done many investigations into &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; misconduct, including one that became the subject of a &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-29/entertainment/ca-1145_1_national-enquirer&quot;&gt;investigative piece&lt;/a&gt; way back in 1990. Before then, tabloids had been seen as almost funny publications, mixing celebrity gossip with space aliens and Elvis sightings. But when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; on-again-off-again relationship with the truth percolated into politics, it wasn’t so funny anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though relatively benign at first (“Al Gore’s Diet Is Making Him Stupid”), the Trump/Pecker relationship has metastasized: In effect, the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/media/national-enquirer-trump-mistresses.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; became an enforcement arm&lt;/a&gt; of the Trump presidential campaign, and presidency, as the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York laid out in its case against Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty. The U.S. Attorney has done the country a service by levying extensive controls on AMI, David Pecker, and his deputy Dylan Howard, through a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1119501/download&quot;&gt;non-prosecution agreement&lt;/a&gt; that requires them to commit no other crimes for three years, and requires everyone at AMI to attend annual training on federal election laws. I’m guessing that’s not how they used to spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;Fancylinks&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be wrong to imply that the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t evolved since the ’90s, because it has. The tabloid and its chairman have evolved into &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;secretly entangling with a nation-state&lt;/a&gt; that’s using its enormous resources to harm American citizens and companies. And now they’ve evolved into trying to strong-arm an American citizen whom that country’s leadership wanted harmed, compromised, and silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Saudi side of the equation: Not only does the kingdom have a close alliance with AMI—which owns the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Star&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt;, Radar Online, and many other publications—but the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/saudi-arabia-hollywood-media-deals-where-they-stand-jamal-khashoggi/&quot;&gt;Saudis have pursued investments&lt;/a&gt; and partnerships involving &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the Robb Report&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike these publications, it’s clear that MBS considers the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; to be a major enemy. Saudi Arabia is hardly the first repressive regime that seeks total control of the news media in its own country. Wanting to control the media in the United States—and using any means to do so—will hopefully prove to be an overreach.&lt;/p&gt;
