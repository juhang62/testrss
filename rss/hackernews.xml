<title>Cloud Run beta pricing</title>
<link>https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing</guid>
<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;special&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beta release of Cloud Run. This feature might be changed in backward-incompatible ways and is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;This page provides pricing information for Cloud Run and Cloud Run on GKE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudrun-pricing&quot;&gt;Cloud Run pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Run charges you only for the resources you use, rounded up to the nearest 100 millisecond. Note that each of these resources have free quota. Your total Cloud Run bill will be the sum of the resources in the pricing table. Note that when setting &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/about-concurrency&quot;&gt;concurrency&lt;/a&gt; higher than one request at a time, multiple requests can share the allocated CPU and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pricing_table_us-central1&quot;&gt;Pricing table (us-central1)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;CPU&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Memory&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Requests&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Networking&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;First 180,000 vCPU-seconds free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First 360,000 GB-seconds free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 million requests free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;First 1 GB egress traffic free platform-wide&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;$0.00002400 / vCPU-seconds beyond free quota&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$0.00000250 / GB-second beyond free quota&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$0.40 / million requests beyond free quota&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Free during beta. At beta exit, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing&quot;&gt;Compute Engine networking prices&lt;/a&gt; apply to egress beyond free tier.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/skus/&quot;&gt;Cloud Platform SKUs&lt;/a&gt; apply.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free quota resets every month; you are billed only for usage past the free quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;billable_time&quot;&gt;Billable Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a given container instance, billable time occurs when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The container instance is starting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one request is being processed by the container instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are billed only for the CPU and memory allocated while a request is active on a container instance, rounded up to the nearest 100 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a container instance receives many requests at the same time, billable time begins with the start of the first request and ends at the end of the last request, as shown in the following diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cloudrun-gke-pricing&quot;&gt;Cloud Run on GKE pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Run on GKE is an add-on for Google Kubernetes Engine. Workloads running in a cluster are included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing&quot;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine pricing&lt;/a&gt;. Final pricing for Cloud Run on GKE will be determined before GA.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft says its data shows FCC reports overstate broadband adoption</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/microsoft-says-its-data-shows-fcc-reports-massively-overstate-broadband-adoption/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/microsoft-says-its-data-shows-fcc-reports-massively-overstate-broadband-adoption/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;The broadband divide in the U.S. is real, but if you want to know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; real, don’t ask the FCC. Its yearly broadband deployment report, already under fire for &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/fcc-looking-into-reported-error-throwing-broadband-deployment-numbers-off-by-millions/&quot;&gt;serious data problems&lt;/a&gt;, has now been &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/04/08/its-time-for-a-new-approach-for-mapping-broadband-data-to-better-serve-americans/&quot;&gt;further questioned by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which says its own data contradicts coverage data provided by internet providers. Despite $22 billion in government &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/02/fcc-gets-ready-to-kick-off-2-billion-rural-broadband-fund/&quot;&gt;spending&lt;/a&gt;, the company says, “adoption has barely budged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blog post, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; explained that it was concerned with apparent inaccuracies in reports purporting to document broadband availability throughout the country. Leveraging data sourced from its various online services, it came to vastly different conclusions than the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have 200 services that we operate as a company,” said Microsoft President Brad Smith &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.microsoft.com/rural-broadband/&quot;&gt;in a recent talk&lt;/a&gt;. “We can see download speeds across the country, and in every county, and we’ve assembled our own map with our own estimates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the FCC report suggests that broadband, as it is currently defined, is not currently available to around 25 million people. Sounds reasonable. But Microsoft’s data says that some 163 million people “do not use the internet at broadband speeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aren’t the same thing, obviously, but you’d think if a person had broadband available they would use it at least now and then, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look further into the problem, Microsoft checked out a few locales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our home state of Washington, the FCC data indicates that 100 percent of Ferry County residents have access to broadband. When we spoke to local officials, they indicated that very few residents in this rural county had access and those that did were using broadband in business. Our data bears this out, showing that only 2 percent of Ferry County is using broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the entire county has broadband, but next to no one uses it? Seems odd. The pattern repeats elsewhere as well, rural and urban, with similar deltas between &lt;em&gt;reported&lt;/em&gt; broadband availability and &lt;em&gt;observed&lt;/em&gt; broadband activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These significant discrepancies across nearly all counties in all 50 states indicates there is a problem with the accuracy of the access data reported by the FCC,” concludes Microsoft’s chief data analytics officer, John Kahan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1809486&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png 1318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-US-maps.png?resize=50,27 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Part of the issue is that internet providers essentially just report their own coverage via a form, and the FCC reports it more or less as fact. That’s a problem not just when a mistake on a form adds tens of millions of subscribers that don’t actually exist, but when large ISPs overstate their coverage so they don’t have to pay to fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s suggestions, which it has made to Members of Congress and the FCC (though it won’t, as I originally wrote here, testify in the Senate on Wednesday) would make it far more difficult to fib on the Form 477, which as written seems to provide enormous leeway for a company to imply coverage that isn’t actually there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems described here are not new or obscure, and even FCC commissioners have taken issue with the way this data is collected. Hopefully given the continued and growing outcry concerning this misleading report we will soon know better who in our country has, or needs, help getting online. That the FCC wants to help I don’t doubt, but in order to do so they need better data.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Notarizing Your App Before Distribution</title>
<link>https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution?language=objc</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution?language=objc</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notarization gives users more confidence that the Developer ID-signed software you distribute has been checked by Apple for malicious components. Notarization is not App Review. The Apple notary service is an automated system that scans your software for malicious content, checks for code-signing issues, and returns the results to you quickly. If there are no issues, the notary service generates a ticket for you to staple to your software; the notary service also publishes that ticket online where Gatekeeper can find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the user first installs or runs your software, the presence of a ticket (either online or attached to the executable) tells Gatekeeper that Apple notarized the software. Gatekeeper then places descriptive information in the initial launch dialog to help the user make an informed choice about whether to launch the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;centered-block&quot; src=&quot;https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/29a6af0be1/a95ea07d-aec7-4217-88d5-921e5c027b32.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/29a6af0be1/a95ea07d-aec7-4217-88d5-921e5c027b32.png 2x&quot; alt=&quot;Gatekeeper lets the user know that Apple notarized the app being launched.&quot; width=&quot;412&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can notarize several different types of software deliverables, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macOS apps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-app bundles, such as kernel extensions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disk images (UDIF format)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat installer packages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notarization also protects your users if your Developer ID signing key is exposed. The notary service maintains an audit trail of the software distributed using your signing key. If you discover unauthorized versions of your software, you can work with Apple to revoke the tickets associated with those versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;aside aside-important&quot; aria-label=&quot;important&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;aside-name&quot;&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in macOS 10.14.5, all new or updated kernel extensions and all software from developers new to distributing with Developer ID must be notarized in order to run. In a future version of macOS, notarization will be required by default for all software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3087727&quot;&gt;Prepare Your Software for Notarization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;21.312368972746&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notarization requires Xcode 10 or later. Building a new app for notarization requires macOS 10.13.6 or later. Uploading and stapling an app requires macOS 10.12 or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple's notary service requires you to adopt the following protections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;9.3513931888545&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable code-signing for all of the executables you distribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.78703703703704&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable the Hardened Runtime capability for your executable targets, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/devf87a2ac8f&quot;&gt;Enable hardened runtime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4.8853754940711&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a “Developer ID” application, kernel extension, or installer certificate for your code-signing signature. (Don't use a Mac Distribution or local development certificate.) For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev154b28f09&quot;&gt;Create, export, and delete signing certificates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include a secure timestamp with your code-signing signature. (The Xcode distribution workflow includes a secure timestamp by default. For custom workflows, include the &lt;code class=&quot;code-voice&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;--timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; option when running the &lt;code class=&quot;code-voice&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;codesign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tool.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.7437722419929&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t include the &lt;code class=&quot;code-voice&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;com&lt;wbr/&gt;.apple&lt;wbr/&gt;.security&lt;wbr/&gt;.get-task-allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; entitlement with the value set to any variation of &lt;code class=&quot;code-voice&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If your software hosts third-party plug-ins and needs this entitlement to debug the plug-in in the context of a host executable, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution/resolving_common_notarization_issues?language=objc#3087731&quot;&gt;Avoid the Get-Task-Allow Entitlement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link against the macOS 10.9 or later SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple recommends that you notarize all of the software that you’ve distributed, including older releases, and even software that doesn’t meet all of these requirements or that is unsigned. Apple’s notary service uses a variety of methods, including telemetry, to determine which of the above rules to relax for preexisting software. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution?language=objc#3087722&quot;&gt;Notarize Your Preexisting Software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;aside aside-important&quot; aria-label=&quot;important&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;aside-name&quot;&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some preexisting software might not run properly after being successfully notarized. For example, Gatekeeper might find code signing issues that a relaxed notarization process didn’t enforce. Always review the notary log for any warnings, and test your software before distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3178095&quot;&gt;Add the Entitlements Needed by Plug-ins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;35.496553884712&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enable the extra security enforced by the hardened runtime, as notarization requires, this impacts both your app and any plug-ins that your app hosts. Plug-ins don’t declare their own entitlements. Instead, they inherit the entitlements of the host process. Therefore, a host app must include all the entitlements that prospective plug-ins require, even when the plug-ins are notarized separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a plug-in employs deep integration with the host executable via C function pointer overrides, or uses a JavaScript engine for custom workflows, the host executable must declare the &lt;a class=&quot;symbol-name&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_allow-unsigned-executable-memory?language=objc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;Allow Unsigned Executable Memory Entitlement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;symbol-name&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_allow-jit?language=objc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;Allow Execution of JIT-compiled Code Entitlement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. In some cases, a plug-in fails to even load if the host executable lacks the proper entitlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also include resource access entitlements, like the Address Book or Location access entitlements, and the related purpose strings, that support your app’s plug-ins. For example, if a Print Dialog Extension (PDE) that provides fax services wants to access a user’s contact list, the host executable must declare the &lt;a class=&quot;symbol-name&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_personal-information_addressbook?language=objc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;Address Book Entitlement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and include the &lt;a class=&quot;symbol-name&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscontactsusagedescription?language=objc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;NSContacts&lt;wbr/&gt;Usage&lt;wbr/&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; purpose string in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list?language=objc&quot;&gt;Information Property List&lt;/a&gt; for the plug-in to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a complete list of hardened runtime entitlements, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime_entitlements?language=objc&quot;&gt;Hardened Runtime Entitlements&lt;/a&gt;. For information about usage strings, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/core_app/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/accessing_protected_resources?language=objc&quot;&gt;Accessing Protected Resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;aside aside-important&quot; aria-label=&quot;important&quot; readability=&quot;3.7898089171975&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;aside-name&quot;&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On macOS 10.14.x, for executables using the hardened runtime, PDEs load only if the host executable has the &lt;a class=&quot;symbol-name&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation?language=objc&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disable Library Validation Entitlement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3087730&quot;&gt;Notarize Your App Automatically as Part of the Distribution Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;32.238805970149&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before distributing your app directly to customers, your Account Holder must sign the app with your Developer ID. Xcode’s Organizer window includes a workflow for generating a distributable version of your app. In Xcode 10 and later, this workflow includes an option to notarize your app automatically. To notarize your app using this workflow, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open your Xcode project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an archive of your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Xcode's Organizer window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Archives tab, select the archive you created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click Distribute App to view the distribution options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose Developer ID for your method of distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click Next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose Upload to send your archive to the Apple notary service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

When the upload is complete, the notary service begins the scanning process, which usually takes less than an hour. While the notary service scans your software, you can continue to prepare your archive for distribution. For example, you can export the archive and perform any final testing that you require prior to making your software available to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the notarization process finishes, Xcode downloads the ticket and staples it to your archive. At that point, export your archive again to receive a distributable version of your software that includes the notary ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to use the Xcode UI to upload your software, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev88332a81e&quot;&gt;Upload a macOS app to be notarized&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;19.555555555556&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notarizing your preexisting software lets Gatekeeper warn users when they try to run it. It also helps the notary service distinguish your legitimate software from variants that have been tampered with. You can notarize an existing disk image, installer package, or ZIP archive containing your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To notarize your preexisting software, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No one, not even the Secret Service, should randomly plug in a strange USB stick</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/secret-service-mar-a-lago/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/secret-service-mar-a-lago/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;If you’ve been on Twitter today, you’ve probably seen one story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article228963409.html&quot;&gt;making the rounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case follows a Chinese national, Yujing Zhang, who is accused of trying to sneak into President Trump’s private Florida resort Mar-a-Largo last month. She was caught by the Secret Service with four cellphones, a laptop, cash, an external hard drive, a signals detector to spot hidden cameras, and a thumb drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrest sparked new concerns about the president’s security amid concerns that foreign governments have tried to infiltrate the resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegations aside and notwithstanding, what sent alarm bells ringing was how the Secret Service handled the USB drive, which cannot be understated — it was not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article228963409.html&quot;&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secret Service agent Samuel Ivanovich, who interviewed Zhang on the day of her arrest, testified at the hearing. He stated that when another agent put Zhang’s thumb-drive into his computer, it immediately began to install files, a “very out-of-the-ordinary” event that he had never seen happen before during this kind of analysis. The agent had to immediately stop the analysis to halt any further corruption of his computer, Ivanovich said. The analysis is ongoing but still inconclusive, he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the big deal, you might think? You might not think it, but USB keys are a surprisingly easy and effective way to install malware — or even destroy computers. In 2016, security researcher Elie Bursztein found dropping malware-laden USB sticks &lt;a href=&quot;https://elie.net/talk/does-dropping-usb-drives-really-work/&quot;&gt;was an “effective” way&lt;/a&gt; of tricking someone into plugging it into their computer. As soon as the drive plugs in, it can install malware that can remotely surveil and control the affected device — and spread throughout a network. Some USB drives can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/this-usb-drive-can-nuke-a-computer/&quot;&gt;fry the innards&lt;/a&gt; of some computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Secret Service spokesperson said the device was “standalone,” but wouldn’t be pressed on details. It remains unknown why the agent “immediately” pulled out the drive in a panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for security folks to seize on the security snafu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake Williams, founder of Rendition Infosec and former NSA hacker, criticized the agent’s actions “threatened his own computing system and possibly the rest of the Secret Service network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s entirely possible that the sensitivities over determining whether Zhang was targeting Mar-a-Lago or the president — or whether she was a legitimate guest or member — may have contributed to the agent’s actions on the ground,” he said, “Never before has the Secret Service had to deal with this type of scenario and they’re probably still working out the playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams said the best way to forensically examine a suspect USB drive is by plugging the device into an isolated Linux-based computer that doesn’t automatically mount the drive to the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would then create a forensic image of the USB and extract any malware for analysis in the lab,” he said. “While there is still a very small risk that the malware targets Linux, that’s not the normal case.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US Workers Are Highly Taxed If You Count Premiums</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2019/04/08/us-workers-are-highly-taxed-when-you-count-health-premiums/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/33502815650_7393421e4c_k-e1505847872759-678x381.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Insurance&quot;/&gt; Got Credit / Flickr
&lt;p&gt;Comparing labor tax rates across countries is a tricky endeavor. Some countries rely mostly on income and payroll taxes charged to workers, others on payroll taxes charged to employers, and still others on compelling workers and employers to pay private parties who provide pension and health insurance products. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, you have to normalize all of these various schemes into a single labor tax concept that actually reflects just how much labor compensation is being put towards compulsory payments of one sort or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OECD produces a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/ctp/taxing-wages-20725124.htm&quot;&gt;Taxing Wages&lt;/a&gt; publications each year that permit this sort of cross-country comparison. Most of these publications focus on converting formal labor taxes into a standardized format that allows researchers to calculate comparable “labor tax wedges” across the various tax schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But formal labor taxes are limited because they omit “non-tax compulsory payments” (NTCPs). NTCPs are payments workers and employers are legally compelled to pay to private parties. NTCPs are no different from taxes except that NTCPs are made to private corporations like health insurance companies rather than to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally the OECD publishes information that combines formal taxes and NTCPs together in order to allow researchers to compare “compulsory payment rates” across countries. The last time they did this was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/non-tax-compulsory-payments.pdf&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;. The 2018 OECD publication acknowledges that employer health insurance premiums in the United States are NTCPs because they are mandated under Obamacare’s employer and individual mandates. But the publication nevertheless excludes employer health premiums from its US NTCP calculations because the authors say these premiums cannot be modelled to their satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apparent reason these mandated premiums are incompatible with the OECD’s Taxing Wages model is that they are open-ended payments: employers and employees have to buy private insurance regardless of its cost. If the mandated premiums were set by law as a fixed sum per worker or percentage of payroll as in other countries, then they could be included in the OECD’s figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Estimating the US Compulsory Payment Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OECD may not be able to include employer-based health insurance premiums into its model, but I certainly can. And when I add them into the OECD model, I find that the average American worker has one of the highest compulsory payment rates in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this analysis, I take the information from the OECD’s Taxing Wages &lt;a href=&quot;https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=AWCOMP&quot;&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; and combine it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/quick_tables_results.jsp?component=2&amp;amp;subcomponent=2&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;tableSeries=-1&amp;amp;tableSubSeries=CDE&amp;amp;searchText=&amp;amp;searchMethod=1&amp;amp;Action=Search&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The MEPS data shows the average premium for employer insurance, broken down by type of coverage (family or single) and payer (employer or employee). By counting those average premiums as NTCPs, we can compute a compulsory payment rate that is comparable to the compulsory payment rates the OECD produces for other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear about what I am doing here, the following graph provides a detailed breakdown of the difference between what we normally think of as “employee taxes” and the OECD concept of “compulsory payments.” This graph is for a married wage-earner with two kids who earns the average wage and has a family insurance plan through their employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Burden-of-Average-Wage-Worker-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;822&quot; height=&quot;485&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5171&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Burden-of-Average-Wage-Worker-2.png 822w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Burden-of-Average-Wage-Worker-2-300x177.png 300w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Burden-of-Average-Wage-Worker-2-768x453.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to count employer-side payroll taxes and employer premium contributions towards the labor tax burden, then you also need to count those things as worker pay. The following graph mirrors the one above except it shows what the average wage really is when you count all of the employer’s labor costs, not just the cash it pays to employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Pay-of-the-Average-Wage-Worker-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;933&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5202&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Pay-of-the-Average-Wage-Worker-4.png 933w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Pay-of-the-Average-Wage-Worker-4-300x177.png 300w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Pay-of-the-Average-Wage-Worker-4-768x454.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can divide each labor tax concept by each pay concept to show the difference between what we often think of as the “employee tax rate” and the actual “compulsory payment rate” (share of labor compensation going to tax and NTCPs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Rate-for-Average-Wage-Worker-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;817&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5205&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Rate-for-Average-Wage-Worker-2.png 817w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Rate-for-Average-Wage-Worker-2-300x185.png 300w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Various-Measures-of-the-Labor-Tax-Rate-for-Average-Wage-Worker-2-768x475.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive measure shows that a married couple with two kids that makes the average wage pays over 43 percent of their income in compulsory payments of one sort or another. Health premiums are 26.4 of the 43.2 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can go back to the OECD NTCP data and compare the US to other developed countries. When we do that, we find that only the Netherlands — with its compulsory private health insurance and compulsory private pension — has a higher labor tax burden by this measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Labor-Taxes-and-Compulsory-Payments-as-Percent-of-Average-Wage-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;783&quot; height=&quot;484&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5203&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Labor-Taxes-and-Compulsory-Payments-as-Percent-of-Average-Wage-2.png 783w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Labor-Taxes-and-Compulsory-Payments-as-Percent-of-Average-Wage-2-300x185.png 300w, https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Labor-Taxes-and-Compulsory-Payments-as-Percent-of-Average-Wage-2-768x475.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what it is like to pay income taxes like they do in Europe, then looking closely at your paystub would be a good start. We don’t pay as many formal taxes as they do, but when you bring in payments we are compelled to pay and that are deducted straight out of our paychecks just like taxes are, it really does not look that much different, at least as far as labor taxes are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a long exercise in pointing out the obvious: American workers already pay more than enough money to provide good health care to everyone in the country. It’s just that they pay it into a private insurance system that wastes large portions of it on rents and administrative redundancy. As the Mercatus Center noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/07/30/mercatus-study-finds-medicare-for-all-saves-2-trillion/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, by implementing a Medicare for All system, the US could insure 30 million more people, provide dental, vision, and hearing coverage to everyone, and virtually eliminate out-of-pocket expenses, all while saving $2 trillion over the first decade of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A majority of consumers do not expect Google to track their activities</title>
<link>https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/04/does-google-meet-its-users-expectations-around-consumer-privacy-this-news-industry-research-says-no/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/04/does-google-meet-its-users-expectations-around-consumer-privacy-this-news-industry-research-says-no/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Numerous privacy scandals over the past couple of years have fueled the need for increased examination of tech companies’ data tracking practices. While the ethics around data collection and consumer privacy have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academia.edu/9358109/Data_mining_Consumer_privacy_ethical&quot;&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt; for years, it wasn’t until Facebook’s Cambridge Analytics &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files&quot;&gt;scandal&lt;/a&gt; that people began to realize how frequently their personal data is shared, transferred, and monetized without their permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica was by no means an isolated case. Last summer, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/f60bc112665b458cb6473d7ee9492932&quot;&gt;AP investigation&lt;/a&gt; found that Google’s location tracking remains on even if you turn it off in Google Maps, Search, and other apps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/08/21/google-data-collection-research/&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; from Vanderbilt professor Douglas Schmidt found that Google engages in “passive” data collection, often without the user’s knowledge. His research also showed that Google utilizes data collected from other sources to de-anonymize existing user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcontentnext.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Content Next&lt;/a&gt;, the trade association of online publishers I lead, wrote this Washington Post op-ed, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-russia-ad-story-isnt-just-about-facebook-its-about-google-too/2017/10/31/061055da-be5d-11e7-8444-a0d4f04b89eb_story.html&quot;&gt;It isn’t just about Facebook, it’s about Google, too&lt;/a&gt;” when Facebook first faced Capitol Hill. It’s also why the descriptor &lt;em&gt;surveillance advertising&lt;/em&gt; is increasingly being used to describe Google and Facebook’s advertising businesses, which use personal data to tailor and micro-target ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
Consumers are on alert. DCN surveyed a nationally representative sample&lt;sup/&gt; to find out what people expect from Google — and, as with a similar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/04/jason-kint-here-are-5-ways-facebook-violates-consumer-expectations-to-maximize-its-profits/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; we conducted last year about Facebook, the results were unsettling.
&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that many of Google’s data practices deviate from consumer expectations. We find it even more significant that consumer’s expectations are at an all-time low even after 2018, a year in which awareness around consumer privacy reached peak heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study are consistent with our Facebook study: People don’t want surveillance advertising. A majority of consumers indicated they don’t expect to be tracked across Google’s services, let alone be tracked across the web in order to make ads more targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-question&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Do you expect Google to collect data about a person’s activities on Google platforms (e.g. Android and Chrome) and apps (e.g. Search, YouTube, Maps, Waze)?
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 48%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: 52%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-question&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Do you expect Google to track a person’s browsing across the web in order to make ads more targeted?
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 43%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: 57%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two out of three consumers don’t expect Google to track them across non-Google apps, offline activities from data brokers, or via their location history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-question&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Do you expect Google to collect data about a person’s locations when a person is not using a Google platform or app?
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 34%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: 66%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-question&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Do you expect Google to track a person’s usage of non-Google apps in order to make ads more targeted?
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 36%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: 64%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-question&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Do you expect Google to buy personal information from data companies and merge it with a person’s online usage in order to make ads more targeted?
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 33%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: 67%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only one question where a small majority of respondents felt that Google was acting according to their expectations. That was about Google merging data from search queries with other data it collects on its own services. They also don’t expect Google to connect the data back to the user’s personal account, but only by a small majority. Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking&quot;&gt;began doing both of these&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 after previously promising it wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-question&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Do you expect Google to collect and merge data about a person’s search activities with activities on its other applications?
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 57%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: 43%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-question&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Do you expect Google to connect a variety of user data from Google apps, non-Google apps, and across the web with that user’s personal Google account?
&lt;div class=&quot;kint-results&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 48%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No: 52%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s personal data collection practices affect the more than 2 billion people who use devices running their Android operating software and hundreds of millions more iPhone users who rely on Google for browsing, maps, or search. Most of them expect Google to collect &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; data about them in exchange for use of services. However, as our research shows, a significant majority of consumers do not expect Google to track their activities across their lives, their locations, on other sites, and on other platforms. And as the AP discovered, Google continues to do some of this even after consumers explicitly turn off tracking. With new laws in Europe and California and with federal discussions about how to bring similar protections to the rest of America, it’s critical to understand what consumers actually demand, align expectations to those demands, and rebuild trust in our industry. Consumers expect nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>58 Bytes of CSS to look great nearly everywhere</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;../post.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;41.1523229246&quot;&gt;
&lt;article readability=&quot;32.723533891851&quot;&gt;&lt;header&gt;
&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-04-06&quot;&gt;apr 6, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;when making this website, i wanted a simple, reasonable way to make it look good on most displays. not counting any minimization techniques, the following 58 bytes worked well for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
main {
  max-width: 38rem;
  padding: 2rem;
  margin: auto;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let's break this down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;max-width: 38rem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it appears that the default font size for most browsers is 16px, so 38rem is 608px. supporting 600px displays at a minimum seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;padding: 2rem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if the display's width goes under 38rem, then this padding keeps things looking pretty good until around 256px. while this may seem optional, it actually hits two birds with one stone - the padding also provides sorely-needed top and bottom whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;margin: auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is really all that is needed to center the page, because main is a block element under semantic html5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;a key insight: it took me a surprising number of iterations to arrive at this point. perhaps that speaks to the fact that i know nothing about &quot;modern&quot; web development, or, as i'm more inclined to believe, just how hard it is to keep it simple in a world of complication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update:&lt;/strong&gt; following some discussion (see footer), i've since changed the padding to 1.5rem for a happier compromise between mobile and desktop displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;p&gt;discuss on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19607169&quot;&gt;hacker news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Open Source Is Winning, and Now It&amp;#039;s Time for People to Win Too</title>
<link>https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/open-source-winning-and-now-its-time-people-win-too</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/open-source-winning-and-now-its-time-people-win-too</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teaching kids about open source? Don't forget to teach them ethics as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I started college, in the fall of 1988, I was introduced to a text editor called Emacs. Actually, it wasn't just called Emacs; it was called &quot;GNU Emacs&quot;. The &quot;GNU&quot; part, I soon learned, referred to something called &quot;free software&quot;, which was about far more than the fact that it was free of charge. The GNU folks talked about software with extreme intensity, as if the fate of the entire world rested on the success of their software replacing its commercial competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who used such programs, either from GNU or from other, similarly freely licensed software, knew that we were using high-quality code. But to our colleagues at school and work, we were a bit weird, trusting our work to software that wasn't backed by a large, commercial company. (I still remember, as a college intern at HP, telling the others in my group that I had compiled, installed and started to use a new shell known as &quot;bash&quot;, which was better than the &quot;k shell&quot; we all were using. Their response was somewhere between bemusement and horror.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time went on, I started to use a growing number of programs that fit into this &quot;free software&quot; definition—Linux, Perl and Python were the stars, but plenty of others existed, from Emacs (which I use to this day), sendmail (pretty much the only SMTP server at the time), DNS libraries and the like. In 1998, Tim O'Reilly decided that although the &quot;free software&quot; cause was good, it needed better coordination and marketing. Thus, the term &quot;open source&quot; was popularized, stressing the practical benefits over the philosophical and societal ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already consulting at the time, regularly fighting an uphill battle with clients—small startups and large multinationals alike—telling them that yes, I trusted code that didn't cost money, could be modified by anyone and was developed by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But marketing, believe it or not, really does work. And the term &quot;open source&quot; did a great job of opening many people's minds. Slowly but surely, things started to change: IBM announced that it would invest huge amounts of money in Linux and open-source software. Apache, which had started life as an httpd server, became a foundation that sponsored a growing array of open-source projects. Netscape tumbled as quickly as it had grown, releasing its Mozilla browser as open-source software (and with its own foundation) before going bust. Red Hat proved that you could have a successful open-source company based on selling high-quality services and support. And these are just the most prominent names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every announcement, the resistance to using open source in commercial companies dropped bit more. As companies realized that others were depending on open source, they agreed to use it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to today, and it's hard to avoid open-source software. It's everywhere, from the smallest companies to the largest. There are still commercial versions of UNIX, but Linux is really all anyone expects or talks about. And Linux is indeed everywhere. My Python and Git courses have never been in greater demand from companies that want to teach their employees to improve their familiarity with these technologies. Whereas it once was possible for one person to know, and to know about, the majority of major open-source software titles, today that's completely impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, while on a flight, my personal screen had some problems. I asked the flight attendant for help, and she told me that it's probably easiest just to restart the screen. Imagine my surprise when I saw myself looking at the Linux boot sequence, in my seat at 30,000 feet! It was at this point that I realized that open source, by virtue of being both inexpensive and open for people to examine and modify, had indeed arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's amazing to me is how even the companies that were most against open-source software have become advocates—not necessarily out of love, but because that's where the market is heading. Microsoft is not only using open source, it's also actively engaging with and supporting the community, encouraging the use of open source, and even contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, have we made it? The answer, of course, is both yes and no. There is no doubt that open-source software has arrived, succeeding beyond my wildest dreams. I mostly earn my living teaching Python and Git to companies around the world, and it's hard to exaggerate the demand for such technologies. Companies are adopting open source as quickly as they possibly can, simultaneously reducing costs and increasing flexibility. Students are learning to use open-source technologies and languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, if measured by market penetration and the acceptance that open-source software can compete, we have definitely won. Sure, there's work to do on the desktop, but the achievements to date are real, tangible and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it's no longer enough to be widespread or even dominant. As a few people were prescient enough to foresee long ago, our world of interconnected computers, phones and devices is generating enormous quantities of data, stored beyond our reach, analyzed by algorithms we cannot see or check, and being used to make decisions that can affect careers, education and medical care, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the business model that was both clever and profitable for so long, namely advertising, has come with an enormous trade-off, in that a number of corporations know more about us than we even know about ourselves. What's amazing is that the advertising-supported services are often so good and useful—and free of charge—that we ignore the ramifications of sharing everything about ourselves with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of today's young people, the internet always has connected us, smartphones always have existed, and the apps we use on our phones and computers always have been free of charge. And if you have to share some of your data, then so what? People no longer seem to be as concerned about privacy and about how much they're sharing with these companies, as was once the case. Perhaps that's because people are getting such obvious benefits from the services they use. But perhaps it's because people are unaware of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; their data is being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 2019 issue of &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt; is all about kids, but it's also our 25th anniversary edition, so it's an appropriate time to ask &quot;What should we be teaching our children about open-source software?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, MIT changed its intro computer science course away from the traditional (and brilliant) class that used Scheme to one that used Python. This certainly made big waves and has influenced hundreds of universities that now also use Python. When MIT changed the curriculum, the professors who wrote the course indicated that for today's software engineers, learning to code isn't enough. You also need to learn topics such as ethics. Many programmers will be asked to do things that are unethical, so it's important to think through the issues before you encounter them at work. Heck, just determining what is considered ethical is a knotty problem in and of itself—one that many developers have probably never considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, it's important for us to teach kids about Linux and open-source software. But it's not enough for us to teach them about the technical parts of things. We also need to inform them of the societal parts of their work, and the huge influence and power that today's programmers have. It's sometimes okay—and even preferable—for a company to make less money deliberately, when the alternative would be to do things that are inappropriate or illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to teach and discuss machine learning—not just as a set of technologies, but also to understand how models work, how they can be wrong, and what you need to do in order to get them right. It's important to discuss how and when such algorithms should be shared with the public and made available to public audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, it's important to explain that no one has a perfect answer to these issues. It's okay to have disagreements. But raising these questions and problems is a major responsibility, and it's important that kids learn from an early age that programming has real-world implications—some of them potentially bad. We don't let people drive until they have demonstrated at least the minimum understanding of how their actions can affect others. I'm not suggesting we require programmers be licensed, but that we raise these important points frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt; has been at the forefront of the Open Source movement for 25 years now, pushing and encouraging us to imagine a world where software is of high quality, available to all, at low or no cost, and that invites us to experiment and tinker. I'm proud to have been writing for this publication for much of that time—since 1996. And although this column generally will continue to have a technical focus, I'm glad that &lt;em&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/em&gt;, as a publication, is focusing on the societal impacts of our work.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Aroma: Using machine learning for code recommendation</title>
<link>https://ai.facebook.com/blog/aroma-ml-for-code-recommendation/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ai.facebook.com/blog/aroma-ml-for-code-recommendation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Thousands of engineers write the code to create our apps, which serve billions of people worldwide. This is no trivial task—our services have grown so diverse and complex that the codebase contains millions of lines of code that intersect with a wide variety of different systems, from messaging to image rendering. To simplify and speed the process of writing code that will make an impact on so many systems, engineers often want a way to find how someone else has handled a similar task. We created Aroma, a code-to-code search and recommendation tool that uses machine learning (ML) to make the process of gaining insights from big codebases much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Prior to Aroma, none of the existing tools fully addressed this problem. Documentation tools are not always available and can be out of date, code search tools often return myriad matching results, and it is difficult to immediately find idiomatic usage patterns. With Aroma, engineers can easily find common coding patterns without the need to manually go through dozens of code snippets, saving time and energy in their day-to-day development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;In addition to deploying Aroma to our internal codebase, we also created a version of Aroma on open source projects. All examples in this post are taken from a collection of 5,000 open source Android projects on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d1x _7f2d _7e23 _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;What is code recommendation and when do you need it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Let’s consider the case of an Android engineer who wants to see how others have written similar code. Let’s say the engineer writes the following to decode a bitmap on an Android phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7et6 _7f2d&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_7et7&quot; id=&quot;u_0_8&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(input);
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;This works, but the engineer wants to know how others have implemented this functionality in related projects, especially what common options are set, or what common errors are handled, to avoid crashing the app in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Aroma enables engineers to make a search query with the code snippet itself. The results are returned as code recommendations. Each code recommendation is created from a cluster of similar code snippets found in the repository and represents a common usage pattern. Here is the first recommendation returned by Aroma for this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d1x _7f2d _7e23 _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Code Sample 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7et6 _7f2d&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_7et7&quot; id=&quot;u_0_9&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

final BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inSampleSize = 2;
// ...
Bitmap bmp = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is, null, options);
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;This piece of code recommendation is synthesized from a cluster of five similar methods found in the repository. Only the common code among the cluster of methods is shown here, with the specific details of individual methods removed in the gap (the ... part).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;What is this code recommendation trying to say? Well, it says that in five different cases, engineers set additional options when decoding the bitmap. Setting the sample size helps reduce the memory consumption when decoding large bitmaps, and, indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fquestions%2F477572%2Fstrange-out-of-memory-issue-while-loading-an-image-to-a-bitmap-object%2F823966%23823966&amp;amp;h=AT1vJ1-2XdyCK6MmSdakWEoHRs9d9nIF2Ag84oXzMqx9rReQtRb7O2G4KzGpYKEXRkS6KeZ7UxfngX_U2S1MBOXwInAerjRLxPDZ4GgqvNkwYNVQhSB3qCi3xkXKXjvxDqQEdkHAIXChezxIfz1g&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-lynx-mode=&quot;hover&quot;&gt;a popular post on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; suggests the same pattern. Aroma created this recommendation automatically by discovering a cluster of code snippets that all contain this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Let’s look at another recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d1x _7f2d _7e23 _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Code Sample 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7et6 _7f2d&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7et8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7et7&quot; id=&quot;u_0_a&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

try {
  InputStream is = am.open(fileName);
  image = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is);
  is.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
  // ...
}
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;This code snippet is clustered from another four methods. It shows a customary usage of &lt;span class=&quot;_7k2h&quot;&gt;InputStream&lt;/span&gt; in decoding bitmaps. Furthermore, this recommendation demonstrates a good practice to catch the potential &lt;span class=&quot;_7k2h&quot;&gt;IOException&lt;/span&gt; when opening the &lt;span class=&quot;_7k2h&quot;&gt;InputStream&lt;/span&gt;. If this exception occurs in runtime and is not caught, the app will crash immediately. A responsible engineer should extend the code using this recommendation and handle this exception properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aroma code recommendations integrated in the coding environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Compared with traditional code search tools, Aroma’s code recommendation capability has several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_7fd2 _7fd3 _7f2d&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Aroma performs search on syntax trees. Rather than looking for string-level or token-level matches, Aroma can find instances that are syntactically similar to the query code and highlight the matching code by pruning unrelated syntax structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Aroma automatically clusters together similar search results to generate code recommendations. These recommendations represent idiomatic coding patterns and are easier to consume than unclustered search matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Aroma is fast enough to use in real time. In practice, it creates recommendations within seconds even for very large codebases and does not require pattern mining ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Aroma’s core algorithm is language-agnostic. We have deployed Aroma across our internal codebases in Hack, JavaScript, Python, and Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d1x _7f2d _7e23 _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;How does Aroma work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;_6voz _7f2d img&quot; src=&quot;https://scontent.fphx1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/56776161_319612768726872_6529514814467735552_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fphx1-1.fna&amp;amp;oh=d11123ee672c6f4f63ac53b04f5ef002&amp;amp;oe=5D061156&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Aroma creates code recommendations in three main stages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1) Feature-based search&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;First, Aroma indexes the code corpus as a sparse matrix. It does this by parsing each method in the corpus and creating its parse tree. Then it extracts a set of structural features from the parse tree of each method. These features are carefully chosen to capture information about variable usage, method calls, and control structures. Finally, it creates a sparse vector for each method according to its features. The feature vectors for all method bodies become the indexing matrix, which is used for the search retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;_6voz _7f2d img&quot; src=&quot;https://scontent.fphx1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/56816242_400533423829948_8647483090727337984_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fphx1-1.fna&amp;amp;oh=c7ff6ce8317251526a1289bd60587756&amp;amp;oe=5D4EDC3A&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;When an engineer writes a new code snippet, Aroma creates a sparse vector in the manner described above and takes the dot product of this vector with the matrix containing the feature vectors of all existing methods. The top 1,000 method bodies whose dot products are highest are retrieved as the candidate set for recommendation. Even though the code corpus could contain millions of methods, this retrieval is fast due to efficient implementations of dot products of sparse vectors and matrices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;_6voz _7f2d img&quot; src=&quot;https://scontent.fphx1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/56725055_1238569596301829_5863678971010351104_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fphx1-2.fna&amp;amp;oh=498c561b67ba65ac5d335a0001964645&amp;amp;oe=5D022E71&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Reranking and clustering&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;After Aroma retrieves the candidate set of similar-looking methods, the next phase is to cluster them. In order to do this, Aroma first needs to rerank the candidate methods by their similarity to the query code snippet. Because the sparse vectors contain only abstract information about what features are present, the dot product score is an underestimate of the actual similarity of a code snippet to the query. Therefore, Aroma applies &lt;em&gt;pruning&lt;/em&gt; on the method syntax trees to discard the irrelevant parts of a method body and retain only the parts that best match the query snippet, in order to rerank the candidate code snippets by their actual similarities to the query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;After obtaining a list of candidate code snippets in descending order of similarity to the query, Aroma runs an iterative clustering algorithm to find clusters of code snippets that are similar to each other and contain extra statements useful for creating code recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;The intersecting algorithm works by taking the first code snippet as the “base” code and then iteratively applying pruning on it with respect to every other method in the cluster. The remaining code after the pruning process will be the code that is common among all methods, and it becomes the code recommendation. Additional details are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1812.01158&amp;amp;h=AT2X5ez2dgyzqMO36an-m8w1qsAMaMJvEYGfR434cOJBziBZZLHRAT0Wz-7d60lFCMg1Q1PXpXVx-GQx11t6J2N8wHLTi3i6GNPiKC8VljIQZ8VFJWUgxDR5_ubyggF68TSw6ziFJBYk4TnAT_wA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-lynx-mode=&quot;hover&quot;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;In this example, each code snippet contains code that is specific to their projects, but they all contain the same code that sets up the options for decoding the bitmap. As described, Aroma finds the common code by first pruning the lines in the first code snippet that do not appear in the second snippet. The intermediate result would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_7et6 _7f2d&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;_7et7&quot; id=&quot;u_0_e&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

InputStream is = ...;
final BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inSampleSize = 2;
Bitmap bmp = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(is, null, options);
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;The code in code snippet 1 about ImageView does not appear in code snippet 2 and is therefore removed. Now Aroma takes this intermediate snippet and prunes the lines that do not appear in code snippet 3, code snippet 4, and so on. The resulting code is returned as a code recommendation. As shown in Code Sample 1, the code recommendation created from this cluster contains exactly the three lines of code that are common among all method bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Other code recommendations are created from other clusters in the same way, and Aroma’s algorithm ensures that these recommendations are substantially different from one another, so engineers can learn a diverse range of coding patterns by looking at just a few code snippets. For instance, Code Sample 2 is the recommendation computed from another cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;This is the true advantage of using Aroma. Rather than going through dozens of code search results manually and figuring out idiomatic usage patterns by hand, Aroma can do it automatically and in just a few seconds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d1x _7f2d _7e23 _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Broader picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1zwi _7d1u _7f2d _1m1h _2t6c _5kal&quot;&gt;Given the vast amount of code that already exists, we believe engineers should be able to easily discover recurring coding patterns in a big codebase and learn from them. This is exactly the ability that Aroma facilitates. Aroma and &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcode.fb.com%2Fdeveloper-tools%2Fgetafix-how-facebook-tools-learn-to-fix-bugs-automatically%2F&amp;amp;h=AT3GCGfwFMSSHtGAtPOYdzd1SnamvfRDkk7P5jGBmXAERT7q2juApkZI3g3QT8-9NgKqUmEFebE2eT8jwyqx3KXdLFvhEV0bUXMZrTBOzT_4wLWa-AjsGCgEZtXS6__xkvKy0vlnU6W5yH6hceof&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-lynx-mode=&quot;hover&quot;&gt;Getafix&lt;/a&gt; are just two of several big code projects we are working on that leverage ML to improve software engineering. With the advances in this area, we believe that programming should become a semiautomated task in which humans express higher-level ideas and detailed implementation is done by the computers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
