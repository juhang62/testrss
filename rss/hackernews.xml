<title>UCLA to faculty: consider refusing reviews for Elsevier, go open access instead</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;article__image img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com//img/photos/biz/photo_90219_landscape_850x566.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U. of California at Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the U. of California at Los Angeles, administrators have encouraged professors to effectively boycott the publishing giant as the university system negotiates a new contract for access to the company’s journals.&lt;/p&gt;
The University of California at Los Angeles has turned to an unusual bit of leverage as its system negotiates with Elsevier, the academic-publishing giant: its own faculty’s research.
&lt;p&gt;In a letter on Tuesday, campus officials asked faculty members to consider declining to review articles for Elsevier journals until contract negotiations “are clearly moving in a productive direction.” The letter also asked professors to consider publishing research elsewhere, including in prestigious open-access journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university system has said it wants to reach an agreement that would be less expensive and would simplify open-access publishing. But time for negotiations is running out: The contract expires on December 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The only thing that the publishers have is the content authors give to them,” said Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason, university librarian at the University of California at Berkeley and a professor of economics and information, who is helping to lead the negotiations. “What they’re selling is access to research. If they don’t have the research, they have nothing to sell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UC system’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Journals/BigDeals/UCalifornia/ElsevierSD2014-2018.pdf&quot;&gt;five-year contract with Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; costs the system about $50 million. The contract allows students, faculty and staff members, and researchers to view the enormous trove of articles that Elsevier publishes. In 2017, the most recent year for which information is available, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/reports/annual-reports/relx2017-annual-report.pdf&quot;&gt;Elsevier published more than 430,000 articles&lt;/a&gt; in some 2,500 journals, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-item__side-bar media-width-half media-pull-right&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Chronicle Productivity&lt;br/&gt;Guide to Writing &amp;amp; Publishing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to its critics, the company has long epitomized the faults of a profitable industry that relies on unpaid labor in peer review and editorial management while charging ever-rising fees. (The company argues that the value of a subscription rises annually because the volume of content is increasing, and published articles are cited more frequently externally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter — from UCLA’s provost, Scott L. Waugh, as well as the chair of the Academic Senate and the university librarian — calls the current situation “unsustainable for the UC system.” A UCLA spokesman said Waugh was unavailable for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unusual letter may prove fraught among some of its recipients. While the library and the provost’s office deal with the direct costs of working with Elsevier, faculty members “are likely to have a much more nuanced relationship” with the company, said Rick Anderson, associate dean for collections and scholarly communication at the University of Utah’s Marriott Library. (Anderson recently joined a library advisory board set up by Elsevier; while he does not receive a stipend, his travel to board meetings has been paid for by the company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are absolutely, centrally important journals in their discipline — not because they’re published by Elsevier but because those journals have a long history of publishing some of the best science,” he said. “That matters to faculty members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-item__story__inline-ad center-block text-center ad-collapsible-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time to his knowledge, he said, that a campus administration has encouraged faculty members to boycott a specific publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason disputed that characterization, calling this a faculty-led effort and adding that there has been at least one other boycott of Elsevier initiated by UC faculty members. Fifteen years ago, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chronicle.com/article/Scientists-at-U-of-California/111349&quot;&gt;sought a worldwide boycott&lt;/a&gt; of six Elsevier-published journals over the cost of access, according to news coverage at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Toward Open Access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the university system nor the company would comment on the specifics of negotiations. Broadly, UC wants one contract that would cover subscription charges and open-access publishing fees, MacKie-Mason said. He said universal, immediate open-access publication for all UC research is also a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UC also hopes to bring down the price of scholarly communications in cases where company profits far exceed the cost of publishing. “We can’t afford it, and we shouldn’t have to,” MacKie-Mason said. “This is publicly funded research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a quarter of what UC spends on journals goes to Elsevier, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.library.ucsf.edu/news/possible-impact-of-the-uc-journal-negotiations-with-elsevier/&quot;&gt;according to a letter&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California at San Francisco library and the Academic Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsevier said in a letter to University of California at Davis faculty editors that UC “wants to pay towards its authors publishing OA [open access] for the world to read freely but only pay a nominal amount to access the world’s subscribed content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is hard to reconcile, the letter said, in a publishing landscape that mixes subscription and open-access publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemma Hersh, Elsevier’s vice president for global policy, said the company wants to resolve the negotiations, adding that no fixed contract works for all universities, particularly regarding open-access standards. “What we’re observing,” she said, “is that globally our customers have different preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Front and Center’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-item__story__inline-ad center-block text-center ad-collapsible-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fully adopted boycott would probably have consequences, Utah’s Anderson said, although he expected that they would be minor. Perhaps more significant, he said, would be if other universities in the California system made similar suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason said there is a “reasonable chance” that the boycott could expand to elsewhere in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction to the university’s letter on social media by faculty members inside and outside the UC system skewed positive, with professors praising UCLA for using its clout to promote open access and to disrupt publishing as an industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, however, expressed concern about the impact on junior faculty members, who must publish to advance their careers. Elsevier’s journals signal prestige in the academic job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimi Adams, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Colorado at Denver, wrote in an email that many existing journals have an established brand, community, and track record — all helpful markers for junior scholars in the tenure process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s especially true for top specialty journals where people outside your area might have to rely more on those signals when they don’t have the expertise to evaluate others’ work outside their own area,” he wrote. “While I’m very in support of developing new avenues of open-access publishing, they aren’t a panacea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason said he did not expect junior faculty members to fear retaliation if they chose not to boycott. “Faculty are given great latitude to pursue their research and the communication of it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the UCLA campus, faculty members are sympathetic to the university’s effort to reduce expenses, particularly in a moment of scrutiny over college costs, said Edward Walker, a professor, vice chair, and director of graduate studies in the department of sociology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university’s letter, he said, had put the issue “front and center” for professors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacKie-Mason, the UC negotiator, said he hoped that if negotiations continued in good faith past the December 31 deadline, the university’s access to Elsevier’s journals would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CenturyLink is blocking customer internet, saying Utah legislators told them to</title>
<link>https://www.richsnapp.com/blog/2018/12-13-centurylink-blocking-internet-in-utah</link>

<description>&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;We've all experienced frustration with the internet going down. Now imagine how frustrated you'd be if you found out that your ISP &lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt; blocked your internet access for the purpose of advertising their software; and better yet, your ISP claimed that state legislators required them to do it! Well that's exactly what is happening to CenturyLink customers in Utah right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;5.7315436241611&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CenturyLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;@CenturyLink&lt;/a&gt; block my internet and then inject this page into my browser (dns spoofing I think) to advertise their paid filtering software to me. Clicking OK on the notice then restored my internet... this is NOT okay! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NtCZUeJF8I&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NtCZUeJF8I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;A few days ago while watching TV through my FireTV the stream unexpectedly went black. After trying to debug the issue for a bit with no success I went to my computer, which was still connected to my ISP, but was also experiencing a strange lack of internet. Eventually I turned to a Google search on my phone only to be immediately greeted with an official looking notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.richsnapp.com/_nuxt/img/beaa8a6.jpg&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;At first glance I was worried that I had somehow been redirected to a malicious website and that this was some kind of phishing attempt... After all, I didn't navigate here. I attempted to do another search but still ended up at this same notice. I considered the idea that maybe my ISP had detected some kind of threat coming from my network and that's why I was seeing this official looking page. Eventually, after reading over the page several times, I clicked &quot;OK&quot; and my internet was back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your Internet service has been fully restored ... Thanks for your business. &lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;CenturyLink High-Speed Internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;What...? I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centurylink.com/home/ease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;the page CenturyLink referred to in the notice&lt;/a&gt; so I could see what was so important that it necessitated blocking me from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Centurylink @Ease puts the best names in computer security to work for you – industry leaders like Norton for AntiVirus protection and Identity Guard to help protect your identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$5 off per month for the first two months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was an &lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;advertisement&lt;/em&gt; for security products! ...and not very good ones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;I went to Twitter to see if I was the only one having this very bizarre experience and it turns out I was not alone. Fellow Utahns were also expressing their discontent with CenturyLink's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.398773006135&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s always a fun day when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CenturyLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;@centurylink&lt;/a&gt; blocks your internet access until you go to troubleshoot the problem and are forced to read a letter about filtering services they offer before they will restore your internet. Wow what a cool way to hold us hostage! Total bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

— 🎃XxCrispxX🎃 (@XxCrispXzero5xX) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/XxCrispXzero5xX/status/1071885034892681216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;December 9, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Eventually I stumbled upon a reddit thread, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/a4csu8/any_century_link_customers_lose_internet_until/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Any century link customers lose internet until you read the filter message?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered this behavior has been going on for quite some time with users mentioning it had also happened to them in the previous weeks. One of the reddit users specifically pointed out that this was most likely a &quot;ham-fisted&quot; approach by CenturyLink to comply with the provisions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/SB0134.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;S.B. 134&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;word-break-normal&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;(b) (i) A service provider shall, before December 30, 2018, notify in a conspicuous manner all of the service provider's consumers with a Utah residential address that the consumer may request material harmful to minors be blocked under Subsection (1)(a).
(ii) A service provider may provide the notice described in Subsection (2)(b)(i):
 (A) by electronic communication;
 (B) with a consumer's bill; or
 (C) in another conspicuous manner.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Relevant excerpt from Utah S.B. 134
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now I finally realized what was going on. CenturyLink was using the unethical practice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_hijacking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;DNS Hijacking&lt;/a&gt; to push notifications (or in this case, advertisements) of products to customers and using Utah law as justification. For the lucky customers, they'll only have their internet browsing session interrupted for no reason, acknowledge they saw the ad, and move on. If they're using a streaming device, such as a FireTV or Chromecast, they'll have their video stop and receive no notification. If you're browsing the internet on a device not using CenturyLink's DNS (maybe using GoogleDNS or OpenDNS), your internet will stop working, you'll see no notice, and you'll either waste time debugging the issue (like me) or give up and waste hours talking to CenturyLink support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Curious if this is really what Utah legislators were intending, I reached out to the listed sponsor of the bill on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;8.390438247012&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;I have yet to see an internet response that appreciates them doing this, but I see a lot of angry and upset people on twitter and reddit. This is such a terribly dumb idea, was this the intent of your bill?&lt;/p&gt;
— Rich Snapp (@Snapwich) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Snapwich/status/1071931301068865536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;December 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.5277777777778&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’m sorry you are having problems. SB134 did not require that — and no other ISP has done that to comply with the law. They were only required to notify customers of options via email or with an invoice.&lt;/p&gt;
— Todd Weiler (@gopTODD) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gopTODD/status/1072189463252488192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;December 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;CenturyLink is much less helpful on twitter, replying to any comments on this shady behavior with what is most likely their contextually unaware automated customer service bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where I go from here, I'm not sure. I would switch ISPs but I have no other options where I live. Hopefully making this issue more public will help CenturyLink make better decisions, but when you consider our administration's recent successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-v-5848a952=&quot;&quot;&gt;repeal of net neutrality earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, we'll probably just need to start accepting this kind of behavior as the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Facebook on Friday &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/12/14/notifying-our-developer-ecosystem-about-a-photo-api-bug/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that a major software bug may have allowed third-party apps to wrongly access the photos of up to 6.8 million users, including images that people began uploading to the site but didn’t post publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The mishap, which occurred over a 12-day period in September, adds to Facebook’s mounting privacy headaches after incidents earlier this year in which it failed to fully safeguard the personal data of its users. It has already prompted European regulators to investigate — and brought fresh calls for the company to be fined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;In general, Facebook allows apps by third-party developers to obtain users' permission and access photos shared on their timeline. Because of the bug, though, roughly 1,500 apps could access “a broader set of photos than usual,” Facebook explained in a blog post. That includes photos that a user may have started to post, but abandoned before actually publishing, because Facebook keeps a copy of the draft in the event a user might want to finish uploading it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The software bug also may have allowed developers to access photos they weren’t supposed to on Marketplace, a Facebook hub for users to buy and sell goods, and some posted in Stories, where users can share short photo or video updates that appear for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Facebook’s latest revelation drew sharp rebukes from privacy advocates. “It’s stunning that Facebook has the ability to send user photos to third parties when the user has not fully uploaded the photo,&quot; said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “It’s like a provider sending draft emails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;In response, Facebook apologized to users on Friday. “Early next week we will be rolling out tools for app developers that will allow them to determine which people using their app might be impacted by this bug,&quot; the company said. &quot;We will be working with those developers to delete the photos from impacted users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Facebook declined to detail the exact apps that may have obtained these photos, or what they may have done with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;The photo mishap could embolden those who believe Facebook and its peers in Silicon Valley should be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/27/trump-administration-is-working-new-proposal-protect-online-privacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regulated for the data they collect about their users&lt;/a&gt;. It could also result in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/08/facebook-could-face-record-fine-say-former-ftc-officials/?utm_term=.7a563611c05b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fines and other penalties&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook, which is already under investigation in the United States for mishandling users' data. That probe, initiated by the Federal Trade Commission, is the result of Facebook’s entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data on 87 million users. A spokesman for the FTC declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Rotenberg said the new incident offered “more evidence” that Facebook has run afoul of the 2011 agreement it brokered with the FTC that required the tech giant to improve its privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;“You can call this a bug, or you can call it what it is: yet another instance of Facebook failing to protect its users’ privacy and running afoul of its 2011 consent decree,” Democratic Sen. Edward J. Markey (Mass.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1073622426121048064?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;echoed in a tweet Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;In Europe, meanwhile, Facebook could face additional fines under the region’s tough new rules governing data-collection practices. Under the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, companies have to inform policymakers &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;within 72 hours of discovering a breach&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook said Friday it found and fixed the bug on Sept. 22, and it notified regulators in late November after an internal investigation to determine the scope of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Privacy regulators in Ireland -- which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/why-europe-not-congress-will-rein-in-big-tech/2018/04/14/a39c8cd8-2e33-11e8-8dc9-3b51e028b845_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oversee Facebook because of the location of its European headquarters&lt;/a&gt; -- said Friday they had received “a number of breach notifications from Facebook” in recent months. “With reference to these data breaches, including the breach in question, we have this week commenced a statutory inquiry examining Facebook’s compliance with the relevant provisions of the GDPR,” a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley is deeply divided over the issue of bug disclosures. Hackers exploit software bugs and vulnerabilities to steal or gain access to data. But bugs are routinely discovered and patched by tech companies – often without evidence that any data was actually taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;Many security experts believe that companies should not have to disclose the mere existence of a bug if there is no evidence that data was compromised. The issue came to a head earlier this year, when reports revealed a security vulnerability in the Google Plus social network. Google came under fire for failing to disclose the bug, but many experts felt that the disclosure should not have been required since there wasn’t clear evidence of stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Several of Facebook’s recent privacy lapses have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/17/a-voter-profiling-firm-hired-by-trump-likely-grabbed-data-for-tens-of-millions-of-facebook-users/?utm_term=.aa5efdc20a01&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;involved third-party apps&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, the firm previously harnessed profile information on Facebook users in 2015 through a quiz app developed by a researcher. In response to that scandal, Facebook initiated a broad review of the games and other third-party apps made available to its users on the site. In May, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/14/facebook-suspends-200-apps-following-cambridge-analytica-scandal/?utm_term=.158e9cca90be&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspended about 200 of them&lt;/a&gt;, declining at the time to describe exactly why.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Snowboarding for Geeks</title>
<link>https://www.xfive.co/blog/snowboarding-ultimate-guide/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.xfive.co/blog/snowboarding-ultimate-guide/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An ultimate guide to snowboarding for creative and tech people (and everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cover photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/XO6FSH3H5CE?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Hamish Duncan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped on the side of the slope on a well visible place (safety first!) when my father said to me: “You are still 5 years younger than I was when I had started to snowboard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started to snowboard as a 47-years old, and during the last 20 years snowboarding took him to places like New Zealand and the National Geographic YouTube channel:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What is it about snowboarding that can change your whole life? How can sliding down a hill on a piece of wood become a lifelong passion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first instalment of our new &lt;em&gt;Sports for geeks&lt;/em&gt; series we will take a thorough look at snowboarding. Whether you are just thinking about trying it for the first time or you already have some experience behind you, we will equip you with a lot of knowledge and practical tips to help you on your snowboarding journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;set-up-progress-have-fun-the-key-ingredients-of-snowboarding&quot;&gt;Set up, progress, have fun – the key ingredients of snowboarding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much more to snowboarding than we realize just by looking at someone riding on a snowboard down the slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboarding has similar aspects to what we do when we set up our tools, learn new things and create as designers or developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboarding can resonate with the geek inside us because it has gadgets, it requires systematic approach to our own progress and it provides a lot of satisfaction and fun we typically find in the creative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;set-up&quot;&gt;Set up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how we pick up and set up our computers and devices, our design or dev tools and work environment, we need to pick up and set up our snowboard equipment. There is a lot of tech involved in modern snowboarding, countless variations we can review and decide about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, we love getting new stuff – new gear we can play with, comparing it to the old one looking for any tiny impact it can have on our experience and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;progress&quot;&gt;Progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboarding is a very technical sport. Even when you master its basics, there are many paths you can progress down and a lot of things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get comfortable with what you already know, you’ll miss the satisfaction that comes from learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of  course, sometimes you can feel frustration if something isn’t happening as you’d wish. It should motivate rather than paralyze you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;snowboarding-history&quot;&gt;Snowboarding history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have been looking for the roots of snowboarding, there probably isn’t an older documented case than the tradition of riding boards in the village of Petran, Turkey. They have been snowboarding for over 300 years, as the following excellent film documents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There isn’t any evidence that Petran snowboarding had influence on development of modern snowboarding. Independently, but not unlikely in the result, its origins date back to early 1960s in the USA when Sherman Poppen created a predecessor of the snowboard, called the “snurfer”. As the name suggests it was inspired by surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;snowboarding-styles&quot;&gt;Snowboarding styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference between snowboarding styles is defined by the boots snowboarders use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;hardboots&quot;&gt;Hardboots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardshell, ski-like boots, are mostly associated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://alpinesnowboarder.com/&quot;&gt;alpine snowboarding&lt;/a&gt; and carving. They are also used in racing and parallel slalom. Alpine snowboards are typically narrower and longer and the stance uses big positive angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3567&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;9.6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3567&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;614&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding.jpg 1024w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding-290x174.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding-350x210.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding-475x285.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding-780x468.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153156/alpine-snowboarding-320x192.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://alpinesnowboarder.com/&quot;&gt;AlpineSnowboarder.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the majority of snowboarders ride in softboots, sometimes they may give alpine snowboarders weird looks. With a recent renaissance of carving in mainstream snowboarding, there is no reason for such rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that while carving in softboots is perfectly possible, the hardboots and alpine snowboards take it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;softboots&quot;&gt;Softboots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding in softboots is the most common way of recreational snowboarding, and unless you know what you do, we recommend starting in them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this guide will focus on riding in softboots as it’s the most versatile form of snowboarding. Soft boots can be used for all different snowboarding styles like carving, freestyle, freeride. We will take a closer look on these styles in &lt;em&gt;Where to progress section&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Softboots is a synonym of freedom associated with snowboarding – walking freely, without heavy skis and clumsy poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;snowboard&quot;&gt;Snowboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboard types have evolved a lot in the last decade. How the snowboard rides is defined by the three main characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;profiles&quot;&gt;Profiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboard profile refers to how a snowboard looks like when you view it from side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153654/camber.png&quot; alt=&quot;Camber snowboard profile&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153654/camber.png 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153654/camber-768x197.png 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153654/camber-290x74.png 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153654/camber-350x90.png 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153654/camber-475x122.png 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13153654/camber-320x82.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center of the snowboard with &lt;strong&gt;camber profile&lt;/strong&gt; is elevated which creates bigger pressure on the contact points (the points where snowboard touches ground) when you stand on the board. The results is more stable ride, more pop for ollies and rebound in turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand it’s easier to catch the edge on it and it doesn’t float that well in powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3570&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155429/rocker.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snowboard with rocker profile&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155429/rocker.png 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155429/rocker-768x197.png 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155429/rocker-290x74.png 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155429/rocker-350x90.png 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155429/rocker-475x122.png 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155429/rocker-320x82.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocker&lt;/strong&gt; snowboards have &lt;strong&gt;reversed camber&lt;/strong&gt; profile and they float better in powder. Usually they are also easier to press when doing butter tricks. They are more forgiving so you are less likely to catch the edge on them, especially if you are a beginner. However, their edge hold is not as good as in camber boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3571&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155708/flat-snowboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snowboard with flat profile&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155708/flat-snowboard.png 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155708/flat-snowboard-768x197.png 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155708/flat-snowboard-290x74.png 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155708/flat-snowboard-350x90.png 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155708/flat-snowboard-475x122.png 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155708/flat-snowboard-320x82.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat&lt;/strong&gt; snowboards are completely flat when lying on the ground. They can be used for variety of riding styles, often they are used for park riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3572&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155751/camrock.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snowboard with CamRock profile&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155751/camrock.png 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155751/camrock-768x197.png 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155751/camrock-290x74.png 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155751/camrock-350x90.png 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155751/camrock-475x122.png 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13155751/camrock-320x82.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid&lt;/strong&gt; profiles combine camber and rocker in certain ways. For example, &lt;strong&gt;CamRock&lt;/strong&gt; shown above uses camber under the feet for greater stability and pop and rocker at the nose and tail for more catch free ride and float in the powder. Another variation is &lt;strong&gt;RockCam&lt;/strong&gt; with rocker between the feet and camber under the bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other profiles like powder specific &lt;strong&gt;S Rocker&lt;/strong&gt;. For more information on camber profiles check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boardworld.com.au/forums/viewthread/4119&quot;&gt;BoardWorld post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;shapes&quot;&gt;Shapes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboard shape specifies how the snowboard look like when you view it from top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboard with &lt;strong&gt;twin shape&lt;/strong&gt; has the same nose and tail and rides equally well in the both directions, so it is a good choice if you want to learn riding switch or do freestyle tricks where you often land switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directional snowboards&lt;/strong&gt; typically have a tapered shape, a wider nose and narrower tail, they ride better in one direction and also float better in powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directional twin&lt;/strong&gt; has the same shape of nose and tail, however the flex is stiffer in the tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this Whitelines video for more information on snowboard shapes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;flex&quot;&gt;Flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flex defines how stiff the snowboard is. It is usually rated on &lt;strong&gt;1 to 10 scale&lt;/strong&gt; with 1 being the softest and 10 being stiffest, with the majority of models falling into the 3 – 7 range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stiffer boards are typically used for freeriding and carving, while softer for freestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;snowboard-categories&quot;&gt;Snowboard Categories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on profile, shape, and flex snowboards are usually sorted out in the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all-mountain freestyle&lt;/strong&gt; – twin or directional twin snowboards with medium flex with focus on freestyle riding all over the mountain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all-mountain freeride&lt;/strong&gt; – directional snowboards with stiffer flex, sometimes with tapered shape, camber profile or hybrid profile for added powder capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;park snowboards&lt;/strong&gt; – twin snowboards with soft to medium flex, camber, rocker, flat or hybrid. Stiffer boards with camber are usually used for bigger jumps and pipe riding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;powder specific&lt;/strong&gt; –  directional snowboards with s-rocker, a tapered shape with wider nose and shorter, narrow tail (a swallow tail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;volume shifted boards&lt;/strong&gt; – a relatively new category of snowboards – these snowboards are wider and shorter, they can have different shape and profiles. Added width increases boards float in powder and reduce probability of boot-out when carving (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;beginner-snowboard&quot;&gt;Beginner snowboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin from SnowboardProCamp has a nice video on what characteristics the beginner snowboard should have:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick run down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;lower price point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flat or mellow camber between the feet for greater stability, rocker towards nose and tail for a more forgiving, catch-free ride (CamRock profile, see above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;soft to middle flex (3 – 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the middle of recommend weight range (don’t choose your snowboard based on your height)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are a man with 12+ US boot size, you should consider mid-wide boards with width around 260mm+ to avoid toe or heel drag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;stomp-pad&quot;&gt;Stomp Pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stomp pad is a piece of foam or plastic you can glue to your board between the bindings – it will help you to ride your board with one foot strapped in, eg. when you get on and off the lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;stickers&quot;&gt;Stickers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stickers are a nice way for some creative expression or preference for certain brands. If you are a complete beginner, avoid extensive sticker job on your snowboard. You probably don’t want to catch more attention than necessary when you are just struggling with the first moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;boots&quot;&gt;Boots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, they are called &lt;em&gt;soft boots&lt;/em&gt;, the snowboarding boots differ by flex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;soft&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;mid flex&lt;/strong&gt; boots are more suitable for beginners and freestyle snowboarding because they allow more flex for the tricks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt; flex boots are oriented towards advanced riders and freeriding, because they more accurately translate movement to the binding and snowboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;lacing-systems&quot;&gt;Lacing systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important difference between boots is the lacing system. There are three main types of lacing systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;traditional laces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speed lacing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boa systems&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;boot-fit&quot;&gt;Boot fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper boot fit is crucial for your comfort and performance on the snowboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboards boots should have a &lt;strong&gt;snug fit&lt;/strong&gt;, which means that your toes should lightly touch the front of the inner liner when you stand straight. When you stand in the snowboard stance, your toes move backward a bit. Your heels should stay locked in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to try out the boots in the socks you will use for riding. If your shop offers such option, have your boots &lt;strong&gt;heat molded&lt;/strong&gt; after the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the following guide for more information:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you struggling with getting proper fitted boots you can also look for an advice in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snowboardingforum.com/boots/&quot;&gt;Snowboarding Forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;bindings&quot;&gt;Bindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3583&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;25.384615384615&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3583&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13162103/strata.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;714&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13162103/strata.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13162103/strata-768x703.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13162103/strata-290x265.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13162103/strata-350x320.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13162103/strata-475x435.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13162103/strata-320x293.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An example of modern snowboard binding, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unionbindingcompany.com/snowboard-bindings/mens/union-strata-bindings-2019#Red&quot;&gt;Union Strata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to snowboards, bindings are categorized according to their intended use to &lt;strong&gt;all-mountain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;freestyle&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;freeride&lt;/strong&gt; categories. Freestyle bindings are typically softer and freeride stiffer, with all-mountain category in between them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because snowboarding bindings translates movements from your boots to snowboard, they need to fit your boots well. The bindings are sold in different sizes (typically S/M, L/XL). Check the manufacturer sizing chart for the proper binding size for your boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you are buying Burton binding, be aware not to buy the EST version if you don’t have a snowboard with the EST channel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest development in bindings technology is Burton’s Step On, which removes necessity of strapping in and off the bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3584&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;25.777777777778&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3584&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13163238/burton-step-on.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Burton Step On&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13163238/burton-step-on.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13163238/burton-step-on-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13163238/burton-step-on-290x152.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13163238/burton-step-on-350x184.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13163238/burton-step-on-475x250.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13163238/burton-step-on-320x168.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.burton.com/us/en/step-on&quot;&gt;Burton Step On&lt;/a&gt; is a combination of strapless bindings and special boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;binding-setup&quot;&gt;Binding setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up bindings means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;customize binding so it fits your boot well (length of straps, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adjust your baseplate length so it creates good support for your boots’ sole (your boot should have some toe and heel overhang, but not too much)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mount it on your snowboard with your preferred angles and so your boots are centered over the board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out this video for more details on binding setup.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;clothing&quot;&gt;Clothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;jacket-and-pants&quot;&gt;Jacket and Pants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacket and pants as top layers protect you from the elements, so focus on solid waterproofing. For the resort riding you should be generally ok with &lt;strong&gt;10k waterproofing and breathability&lt;/strong&gt; unless you live in very wet climate. For freeriding you might want to go to 20k and up (GORE-TEX®, eVent™ and other materials) if your budget allows it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to insulation, a good compromise for resort riding is a light insulation in the jacket. For freeriding technical, non insulated jackets are a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3618&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;18.133333333333&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3618&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090656/seb-toots.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;760&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090656/seb-toots.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090656/seb-toots-768x748.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090656/seb-toots-290x283.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090656/seb-toots-350x341.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090656/seb-toots-475x463.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090656/seb-toots-320x312.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.oneill.com/collections/mens-snow-jackets/products/seb-toots-terrain-jacket&quot;&gt;O’Neill signature jacket&lt;/a&gt; of a pro snowboarder Seb Toots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially as a beginner you may sit on ground more often so pay attention to choosing quality pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboarding jackets should have a powder skirt inside, which prevents snow from getting to your waist and can be attached to your pants. Volcom offers a patented &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.volcom.com.au/news/volcom-zip-tech-jacket-to-pant-system-keeps-snow-out/&quot;&gt;jacket-to-pant zip feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good alternative are bib pants because they provide a good protection against snow and also allow free movement of the waist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3625&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;8.5333333333333&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3625&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090956/dc-bibs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;819&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090956/dc-bibs.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090956/dc-bibs-768x806.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090956/dc-bibs-290x305.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090956/dc-bibs-350x368.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090956/dc-bibs-475x499.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14090956/dc-bibs-320x336.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dcshoes.com/platoon-snow-bib-pants-191282235331.html&quot;&gt;Platoon Snow Bib Pants&lt;/a&gt; from DC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to style, jacket and pants usually come in three styles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;loose fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standard fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slim fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose the fit you like but ensure that any protective gear you use fits under it. As a beginner you might want to pick standard to loose fit for freedom of movement. What can feel a bit baggy and oversized doesn’t feel like that much when riding. This is especially true for the pants which need relatively big leg openings to fit over the boots. Also make sure that your pants are long enough even when you squat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evo.com/guides/outerwear-fit-jacket-length-guide&quot;&gt;Evo’s guide on outerwear fit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;gloves&quot;&gt;Gloves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gloves you have two options – &lt;strong&gt;mitts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gloves&lt;/strong&gt;. Mitts are more popular among snowboarders as they will keep your hands warmer. They may make it a bit harder to operate things like your zips or bindings buckles, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3626&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3626&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14091158/crab-grab-mitts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;956&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14091158/crab-grab-mitts.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14091158/crab-grab-mitts-768x941.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14091158/crab-grab-mitts-290x355.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14091158/crab-grab-mitts-350x429.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14091158/crab-grab-mitts-475x582.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14091158/crab-grab-mitts-320x392.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://crabgrab.com/collections/mittens/products/snuggler-mitt?variant=12692778451030&quot;&gt;Snuggler Mitt&lt;/a&gt; by Crab Grab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure that your gloves are easy to take off and put on, especially if you plan to use wrist protection. If they go under your jacket sleeve check out that your sleeve has enough room to fit them under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;base-and-mid-layers&quot;&gt;Base and mid layers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base layer should be from functional material to keep you warm and dry. You can try a one-piece bottom layer for extra warmth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on whether your jacket is insulated or not, you can pick up a hoodie or inner layer jacket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;facemask&quot;&gt;Facemask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facemask, balaclava, or neck warmer is a must on the snowboard. It will keep snow and wind out of your face and neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;socks&quot;&gt;Socks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinner socks can keep your feet warmer than thick socks, which tend to pack up in the boots and reduce blood circulation. Choose socks from synthetic materials or wool (for example Merino Wool) which keeps warm even when wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;goggles&quot;&gt;Goggles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goggles should offer a good peripheral vision and fit your face without any discomfort. They are often sold with two pairs of glasses – one for low light condition and another one for sunny days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;helmet&quot;&gt;Helmet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A helmet is &lt;em&gt;a must for a beginner&lt;/em&gt; on a snowboard. Catching the edge is one of the most common reasons of fall – slamming your head against the snow is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like the look of a helmet consider wearing your goggles under the helmet for a more stylish look. In any case avoid a gap between the goggles and helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;wrist-guards&quot;&gt;Wrist guards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrist injuries are quite common among snowboarders. When you fall down you instinctively try to reduce impact by using your hands – instead, try spread out impact by using your forearms (see Common mistakes in the next section for more details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;impact-shorts&quot;&gt;Impact shorts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact shorts can come in handy, especially when beginning since you tend to sit more on the snow and falls on tailbone are more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;boot-insoles&quot;&gt;Boot Insoles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

If you get your own iron like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://tokous.com/t8-iron-800w-110v-us/&quot;&gt;T8 by Toko&lt;/a&gt; you can save on snowboard service costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;learn-how-to-snowboard&quot;&gt;Learn how to snowboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you are equipped with everything you need, it’s time to learn snowboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;lessons-or-self-learning&quot;&gt;Lessons or self-learning?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, we absolutely recommend that you &lt;strong&gt;take lessons to learn how to snowboard&lt;/strong&gt;. An experienced snowboarding instructor can make your learning process effective and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if for any reason you don’t want to or cannot take lessons, this section explains the typical process of learning how to snowboard. Even if you are about to take lessons, it’s useful to understand how the process works so later you can follow along more easily or train on your own after the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;finding-your-stance&quot;&gt;Finding your stance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you should determine which foot is dominant – whether you are a &lt;strong&gt;regular&lt;/strong&gt; – riding with your left foot forward or &lt;strong&gt;goofy&lt;/strong&gt;, riding with your right foot forward. Check out the following video on some tips on how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;set-up-your-snowboard&quot;&gt;Set up your snowboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, you need to mount the bindings on your snowboard. Two variables come into play here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stance width&lt;/strong&gt; – it should feel comfortable and stable and allow you to squat, generally it should be slightly wider than your shoulders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;binding angles&lt;/strong&gt; – the most common stance on snowboard is a “duck stance”. Your front binding has positive angle and the rear binding a negative one. This will allow you to ride more comfortably on switch (with your opposite leg forward) . It’s common to set up front binding with slightly larger angle on the front foot, eg. +12/-9, or 18/-12, but for beginning  you can set up the equal angles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;the-painful-truth-about-snowboarding-beginnings&quot;&gt;The painful truth about snowboarding beginnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most falls in snowboarding, especially when beginning, are caused by catching the edge. When your edge digs to the snow, your snowboard stops and the inertial force slams you to the ground – this can hurt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The painful truth is that many beginners learn to snowboard in circumstances that are very prone to catching the edge – on flat slopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a flat slope the edge opposite to the one you are trying to ride on is naturally very close to the ground and prone to digging into the snow, particularly because you haven’t developed a good control over the edges yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3588&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3588&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13164325/flat-vs-steeper.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13164325/flat-vs-steeper.png 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13164325/flat-vs-steeper-768x246.png 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13164325/flat-vs-steeper-290x93.png 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13164325/flat-vs-steeper-350x112.png 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13164325/flat-vs-steeper-475x152.png 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/13164325/flat-vs-steeper-320x103.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The bottom edge of the snowboard on a flat slope (left) is closer to the snow than on steeper slope (right)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can minimize the risk of this happening by two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;practice your first moves on snowboard with just one foot attached first, see the QuickRide system below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practice sideslipping with both foot attached on slightly steeper slope where the opposite edge is further from the snow. This has two advantages
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;a bigger margin for error&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;board slides easier on a steeper slope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;casi-quickride-system&quot;&gt;CASI QuickRide System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to demonstrate a typical learning process is on CASI’s QuickRide System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QuickRide is a system used for teaching snowboarding by &lt;a href=&quot;https://casi-acms.com/&quot;&gt;CASI, Canadian Association of Snowboard Instructors&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the product of 20 years of experience, innovation and refinement and it provides the most comprehensive and fastest way of how to learn to snowboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you might expect you will spend a lot of time &lt;strong&gt;practicing with just front foot attached&lt;/strong&gt; to the snowboard in the initial lessons. This gives you an option to step out away from the board if you are about to fall or if you catch an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get familiar with QuickRide basic principles in this video.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The progression steps in the QuickRide system are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sliding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;basics&quot;&gt;Basics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal in this step is to &lt;strong&gt;get familiar with your snowboard&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;get comfortable moving around on with one leg attached&lt;/strong&gt;. You start by practicing on a flat area, trying out how the snowboards slides and how it feels to stand on it in a neutral balanced position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you progress to skating and climbing and descending with one leg attached. These skills are very handy when it comes to moving around with your snowboard and getting on and off the lifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;sliding&quot;&gt;Sliding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the sliding step is to &lt;strong&gt;become comfortable on the snowboard while it slides&lt;/strong&gt;. You start on a flat area pushing with one leg and then putting the other leg on the snowboard. Next you progress to sliding on the snowboard on a flat slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you practice turning the snowboard with toe and heel drag and J-turns with still just one foot attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;control&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third step you learn to &lt;strong&gt;control both speed and direction&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;with both feet attached&lt;/strong&gt; to the snowboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you try sideslipping with one foot attached and also changing direction this way. Then it’s time to attach board to the both feet for the first time. You learn how to create a platform in the snow so you don’t have sit down when strapping into your bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you practice sideslipping and pendulum on heel and toe edge (notice the steeper slope in the video)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;turning&quot;&gt;Turning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of turning step, is to &lt;strong&gt;learn turning by changing edges in the fall line&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes exercises like garlands, J-turns and finally beginner turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;flow&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final step of QuickRide system you will learn to &lt;strong&gt;explore mountain safely&lt;/strong&gt;. You will improve your turns by adding traverse between them and learn how to flex and extend your position to better absorb terrain and control your speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;common-mistakes&quot;&gt;Common mistakes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 60-70% of recreational snowboarders don’t ride with proper technique. Your observations may vary depending on where you ride. Whether this is a result of not taking lessons or not understanding the correct technique, the truth is that it’s very easy to develop bad habits which then may be hard to get rid of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the most common mistakes on how to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;not-being-in-a-balanced-position-on-snowboard&quot;&gt;Not being in a balanced position on snowboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Snowboard Addiction video explains what a balanced position is and how you can practice it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;straight-legs&quot;&gt;Straight legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next video discusses another common problem – the straight legs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;turning-with-counter-rotation&quot;&gt;Turning with counter rotation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning with counter rotation is one of the common mistakes beginner and intermediate snowboards do:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Counter-rotation has its important place in snowboarding but you need to use it for the right purpose, eg. speed checks or in freestyle where it’s a part of many tricks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;riding-on-a-flat-base&quot;&gt;Riding on a flat base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding on a flat base means that you don’t apply any pressure to any of your edges and your snowboard rides just on its base. It’s very easy to catch the edge in such situation. Always try to apply slight pressure on one of the edges even when riding down the fall line on cat tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only ride on a flat base when switching from edge to edge during the turns or in powder. You also ride flat base on boxes when doing freestyle tricks or when you training for them on the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;falling-on-hands&quot;&gt;Falling on hands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common injuries in snowboarding are wrist injuries. Learn how to fall properly by spreading out impact.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;how-to-improve-your-riding&quot;&gt;How to improve your riding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboard Addiction has an another nice video summarizing all common mistakes and tips how to improve your riding&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;snowboarding-etiquette&quot;&gt;Snowboarding etiquette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboarders have earned a bad reputation among skiers over the years – they often see us as those who sit in the middle of the slope. Maybe you don’t care what skiers think, but for your own safety and safety of others, try to avoid doing this. If you need to stop, stop on the side of the track where other people can clearly see you. Never stop behind the lip or on places where others cannot see you.&lt;/p&gt;

Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/SW4BTHmSGQg?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Ostap Senyuk&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get familiar with rules valid for the resort when you are riding. Not only they will help you to ride more safely, it’s good to know them when something happens and people start to argue about whose fault it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your common sense and see beyond rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a general rule that the skier or rider behind you is responsible for safely passing you. However, if you are doing wide open carving turns without looking uphill, you are asking for  trouble. It’s better to be safe than sorry – always look uphill when crossing the slope to avoid being hit by someone bombing down. It’s easier to look uphill when you are on your toe edge, learn to quickly look over the shoulder when on the heel edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;how-to-teach-children-to-snowboard&quot;&gt;How to teach children to snowboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you’ve might seen YouTube videos of 2 or 3-year old children snowboarding, snowboarding is harder to grasp for an average child than skiing. While with skis a child can move their feet freely and only need to understand two relatively simple concepts (pizza / french fries), the sideways movement and balance involved in snowboarding is not that natural for small kids. This is partially because their centre of mass is moved towards the head until the age of 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with anything related to sports in small children, play and fun is the key. It’s more about experience than technique. Children are are not able to develop the same skills refinement as adults until the age of 12, anyway. As snowboarding represents one way load on body, it’s important to avoid overdoing it at a young age and devote enough time to compensation exercise or free play which best develops essential motor skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to safely experience mountains with your smaller children on a snowboard is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://mdxone.com/&quot;&gt;MDXONE snowboard harness&lt;/a&gt; which is approved by CASI (Canadian Association of Snowboard Instructors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3639&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3639&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14094638/mdxone1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;759&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14094638/mdxone1.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14094638/mdxone1-768x747.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14094638/mdxone1-290x282.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14094638/mdxone1-350x341.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14094638/mdxone1-475x462.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14094638/mdxone1-320x311.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;With my then 4-years old son using MDXONE harness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;where-to-progress&quot;&gt;Where to progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many areas to progress to after you master snowboarding basics. In this section we will describe the most common ones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;switch-riding&quot;&gt;Switch Riding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you took snowboard lessons or followed QuickRide system, chances are that you have already ridden on switch – with your opposite leg forward. Being able to ride switch is necessary if you want to progress to freestyle snowboarding as even some basic trick like 180 end in the switch position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out SnowboardProCamp video with 10 switch riding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;freeride&quot;&gt;Freeride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeride refers to riding your snowboard in free terrain – it can be a nearby terrain outside the groomed tracks in your local resort, further areas you have to hike to or extreme terrain in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;powder&quot;&gt;Powder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeride snowboarding is mostly associated with riding powder. It’s one of the best feelings you can have on snowboard closely related to snowboarding roots in surfing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For powder riding it’s crucial that the nose of your snowboard stays on the top of the snow. Depending on your snowboard this can be easier or harder to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to ride on a &lt;strong&gt;powder specific snowboard&lt;/strong&gt; with wide rocker nose which naturally stays on the top of the snow and narrow, short tail which sinks down. If you have a twin snowboard you need to &lt;strong&gt;weight over your tail&lt;/strong&gt; more which typically leads to bigger back leg burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to start with powder riding is during powder days in resorts, as sometimes there is powder directly on tracks or the nearby terrain is relatively safe for practicing your first powder runs (beware: this doesn’t apply for trees, see below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;advanced-freeride&quot;&gt;Advanced Freeride&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you progress to certain level, you can try more advanced forms of freeriding in backcountry. Backcountry areas can be sometimes reached from the resorts but often they require a serious hike. Splitboards are popular for this purpose. Commercial services like cat- and heli skiing are also available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;safety&quot;&gt;Safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety is a huge concern when it comes to freeriding because of the risk of avalanches, tree wells, hitting trees or falling down in the exposed terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree wells are especially dangerous even for beginners because they can form in the trees in the resort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Never undermine such risk and get all required equipment, training and follow instructions of the mountain rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;carving&quot;&gt;Carving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carving is going through a renaissance in snowboarding nowadays. Many riders who are getting older are not hitting parks that often and are looking for an alternative fun. It’s also been popularized by videos like the &lt;em&gt;Yearning for Turning&lt;/em&gt; series from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.koruashapes.com/&quot;&gt;Korua Shapes&lt;/a&gt; (a snowboard brand which specializes in carving snowboards for soft boots).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Carving means that you ride through the turns only on edges of your snowboard and leave a thin line behind you (as opposite to sliding turns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the following video from Snowboard Addiction to learn carving basics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Certain snowboard setups are better for carving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;stiffer, &lt;strong&gt;camber dominant snowboards&lt;/strong&gt; hold edge better through the carves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wider snowboards&lt;/strong&gt; are also better for carving because you typically have less toe and heel overhang on them. The lower you get in the carve, the closer your toes or heels get to the snow and you risk a “boot out” – your boot digs to the snow and the edge loses contact with the snow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When carving always pay attention to safety – you are doing wider turns which require more space so look uphill during your turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;freestyle&quot;&gt;Freestyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freestyle snowboarding refers to doing various tricks on snowboard. You can do these tricks on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;flat ground – the flat surface of the slopes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boxes, rails and other features in a terrain park&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jumps in the terrain park&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;natural features like side hits, lips, etc. in resort or in free terrain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;urban features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;half-pipe or quarter pipe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3642&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;9.4545454545455&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3642&quot; src=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;685&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash.jpg 1024w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash-290x194.jpg 290w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash-350x234.jpg 350w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash-475x318.jpg 475w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash-780x522.jpg 780w, https://www.xfivecdn.com/xfive/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/14100517/661578-unsplash-320x214.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/sCkkz2wygnw?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Robson Hatsukami Morgan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freestyle is the most creative part of snowboarding and is an endless source of inspiration for your progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get better at snowboarding in general, you should incorporate freestyle into it early because it will improve your balance and overall riding competence. Wear additional protective gear if you just start with freestyle snowboarding or any time you learn a new trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to go to a snow park to start with freestyle, you can practice many freestyle tricks on the slope. These are called flat-ground tricks and the basic one is ollie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;ollie&quot;&gt;Ollie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollie is the basic freestyle trick and foundation of many other tricks. You shift your weight over the back leg and load the tail of your snowboard like a spring. Then pop from it and bring your knees to the chest. It needs to be one fluid motion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;rotation-vs-counter-rotation&quot;&gt;Rotation vs. counter rotation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you move on, you should understand how rotation and counter rotation works on a snowboard because they are part of almost all other snowboard tricks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;butters&quot;&gt;Butters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butters are fun and stylish &lt;strong&gt;flatground tricks&lt;/strong&gt;. Usually they consist of pressing nose or tail of your snowboard and spinning around in certain way (hence the name, because of the movement being reminiscent of spreading butter). Buttering is also a good preparation for jibbing because many jibbing tricks have their flat ground counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the basic buttering position and &lt;strong&gt;tailpress&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;nosepress&lt;/strong&gt;. Some don’t call these butters because they don’t involve spinning but they are basic building blocks of all other butter tricks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Check out Snowboard Addiction’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPvkUAVIOIA&amp;amp;list=PLBMGwWHdh0Eb9WSYaKUlgx0WZzZtm51nh&quot;&gt;buttering trick playlist&lt;/a&gt; for many variations of butter tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to butter on softer snowboards, just in case you wonder why you may have trouble doing butters on a stiff, freeride board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;jumping&quot;&gt;Jumping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping on a snowboard is the next logical progression when you get more control over your snowboard on the flat ground. It can be tempting but also intimidating for beginners – start easy and move your way up through the following Snowboard Addiction tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;


















&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;jibbing&quot;&gt;Jibbing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jibbing is the most technical form of freestyle snowboarding. It means sliding with your snowboard on boxes or handrails. You can slide on these features with snowboard parallel to them (50-50) or perpendicular (boardslides) or combine them in various ways. You can jump to and out of the features using rotation and counter rotation and use presses. This creates endless combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow along these tutorials to start your jibbing training.&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;off-season-training&quot;&gt;Off season training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you stay fit or even develop your snowboarding skills outside the winter season? Here are a few tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;skateboarding&quot;&gt;Skateboarding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skateboarding and snowboarding have much in common – balanced position, sideways movement, tricks. Many pro snowboarders are also very good skateboarders. Skateboarding is more technical and challenging as it requires you to push to move forward (unless you ride an electric skateboard, of course). Nevertheless, it’s an excellent and the most affordable preparation for snowboarding during summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;workout&quot;&gt;Workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowboarding specific workout should focus on increasing your mobility and flexibility, functional and explosive strength and endurance of your core muscles and legs. Don’t forget appropriate upper body workouts. Examples of training that cover these areas can be calisthenics, parkour, street workout or weight training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, staying physically active during the whole year through any activity (strength training, running, swimming, hiking, cycling) is also a good preparation for snowboarding season, especially as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;

Aaron Swartz on One Web Day, at the Berkman Klein Center For Internet &amp;amp; Society on September 22, 2006.Photo: Doc Searls/CC BY 2.0&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years before the U.S. government’s first known inquiry into the activities of Reddit co-founder and famed digital activist Aaron Swartz, the FBI swept up his email data in a counterterrorism investigation that also ensnared students at an American university, according to a once-secret &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NHmbf1PfdWBqqIkqE9a70xOIv92zERMf/view?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NHmbf1PfdWBqqIkqE9a70xOIv92zERMf/view?usp=sharing', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; first published by Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email data belonging to Swartz, who was likely not the target of the counterterrorism investigation, was cataloged by the FBI and accessed more than a year later as it weighed potential charges against him for something wholly unrelated. The legal practice of storing data on Americans who are not suspected of crimes, so that it may be used against them later on, has long been denounced by civil liberties experts, who’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/other/national-security-letters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.aclu.org/other/national-security-letters', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;called on courts and lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; to curtail the FBI’s “radically” expansive search procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2008, days before Swartz’s 22nd birthday, FBI investigators were combing the internet for any information they could find on the young man fated to become one of the internet’s most celebrated figures. At the time, the bureau was working to determine whether Swartz had violated any laws when he downloaded millions of court documents from an online system known as PACER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI would ultimately conclude that no crime had been committed and that the court records already belonged to the public. (Some three years later, the U.S. government charged him with crimes related to mass-downloading from another database.) But on that day in November, the investigators would leave no stone unturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from information published on Wikipedia and using investigative tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LexisNexis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LexisNexis', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Accurint&lt;/a&gt;, FBI employees began quietly building a profile of the oft-described technology “wunderkind,” noting, for example, his involvement in the creation of the formatting language Markdown and RSS 1.0, and jotting down the various code frameworks that Swartz had helped to create and organizations that he had helped to found. Eventually, with all open source avenues exhausted, an FBI employee sat down at a computer terminal that, to most people, would appear plucked straight from the 1980s. The employee ran a search using the bureau’s automated case support system, a portal to the motherlode of FBI investigative files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;827&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;y9g8uthusuirb2khnyux&quot; data-format=&quot;png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the FBI worker typed in Swartz’s internet domain—aaronsw.com—he got a hit. A single file popped up bearing the case number 315T-HQ-C1475879. The prefix, 315, is a numerical classifier that was assigned to the file when it was created nearly two years before. It told the FBI employee that Swartz’s domain was linked, though not precisely how, to an international terrorism case. And then they cracked it open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;315T-HQ-C1475879&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case has been something of a mystery since its &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTPr6SRfF26banwCORZCgf_jqwl5pOXq/view?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTPr6SRfF26banwCORZCgf_jqwl5pOXq/view?usp=sharing', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;existence&lt;/a&gt; was first unearthed by journalists and researchers who engaged the FBI in lengthy court battles over records related Swartz, a celebrated internet rights activist, who, while being targeted by overzealous prosecutors in January 2013, died by suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the newly released document, obtained first in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by transparency group &lt;a href=&quot;https://propertyofthepeople.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://propertyofthepeople.org/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Property of the People&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that Swartz was already of investigative interest to the FBI years before he was criminally charged with downloading millions of articles and documents from JSTOR, an expansive digital library of academic journals, in early 2011 and, more importantly, nearly two years before the Justice Department considered charges against him related to his PACER activity—the first known law enforcement probe to involve him, until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI has long argued in favor of growing its profound authority to acquire Americans’ private communications data in huge quantities without a judge’s approval. But the document obtained by Property of the People, which was formerly classified “secret,” appears to exemplify, using a rather high-profile figure, the many inherent risks in allowing police agencies to secretly stockpile data on innocent Americans in the name of national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document appears to show that in early 2007, the FBI cataloged a substantial amount of email metadata from the computer science and IT departments of the University of Pittsburgh, citing as justification the pursuit of a terrorism lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrorist group at the center of the investigation is also identified by name—Al Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;982&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;rwkeb6hfzeeoeghtxz2b&quot; data-format=&quot;png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That any information about Swartz was collected during an Al Qaeda investigation—only to be retrieved nearly two years later for totally unrelated purposes—adds a familiar and sympathetic face to a controversial procedure in intelligence gathering commonly referred to as a “backdoor search.” That is, the FBI gathering information about Americans who are not accused of crimes, often without a warrant; storing that information in databases, sometimes for years; and later accessing it during the course of another investigation that ultimately has nothing to do with terrorism whatsoever. (Backdoor searches are most commonly associated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/backdoor-search&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.eff.org/pages/backdoor-search', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Section 702&lt;/a&gt; of the FISA Amendments Act, an authority that was unavailable to the FBI at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the substantive details of this terrorism investigation remain a mystery, legal experts who spoke to Gizmodo said they were alarmed—but not the least bit surprised—to hear the FBI used information gleaned in a terrorism case as it tried to build a criminal one against Swartz long after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s disturbing that the FBI is mining this information for unrelated criminal investigations that have nothing to do with why it was collected in the first place,” said Neema Singh Guliani, the American Civil Liberties Union’s legislative counsel. This practice, she said, is another example “of the way in which this authority has been abused by the government and underscores the need for reform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain types of electronic information, most of which can be described as “metadata,” may be acquired by the FBI without a warrant, provided it certifies there’s a “specific and articulable” link to suspected terrorist activities. This is basically the legal equivalent of a hunch, a threshold which is floors below probable cause. And this key: Obtaining that same information under any other circumstance—except in the case of espionage—would otherwise require a court order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;4953&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;emawld0dplfjc4cp9l5m&quot; data-format=&quot;jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Photo: Joi/CC BY 2.0&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How specifically the FBI came to possess Swartz’s email data remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after reviewing the document and other related files, several legal experts told Gizmodo the most likely explanation was that the FBI had used a National Security Letter (NSL), a ubiquitous tool for obtaining email header data at the time. An NSL would have enabled federal agents to demand access to the data and then impose a gag order to maintain secrecy around the investigation, all without a judge’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorized under the Stored Communications Act, in cases of suspected terrorism or espionage, these letters enable the FBI to seize a variety of electronic records under its own authority. While agents cannot use an NSL to acquire the &lt;em&gt;contents&lt;/em&gt; of an email message, the FBI’s notes appear to show that, in Swartz’s case, it sought only “email headers,” data the FBI would argue falls well within the scope of its power to seize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property of the People co-founder Ryan Shapiro, who holds PhD from MIT, told Gizmodo that the Justice Department was “particularly aggressive” in court while trying to keep its prior, and formerly undisclosed, investigative interest in Swartz under wraps. It only relented, he said, when it seemed the U.S. attorney feared an unfavorable ruling, which could impact the Justice Department in future court cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FBI does nearly everything in its power to maintain its functional immunity from the Freedom of Information Act. As one element of its anti-FOIA efforts, the FBI is notorious for the deliberate poverty of its FOIA searches,” he said. “In this case, the Bureau even made the ludicrous claim that documents about Aaron Swartz’s email address, email header data, and domain weren’t related to him, and therefore were outside the scope of the FBI’s search for records about Swartz. It took us years of litigation to force the FBI to finally search for and even partially release this important document.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI declined to comment on the case and instead pointed to Justice Department guidelines that define the scope of the FBI’s authority. “The manner in which the FBI acquires information must meet a legal threshold, and the use of that information is governed by legal statutes and guidelines on investigations established by the Attorney General. In addition, the FBI’s use of its legal authorities is subject to robust oversight by all three branches of government,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;University snooping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While heavily redacted, the document obtained by Property of the People offers multiples clues as to the origin of the collected email data. It almost certainly originated from the University of Pittsburgh (PITT). At the time of writing, however, it remains unknown what connected the University to an investigation involving Al Qaeda in 2007. (Several key portions of the records are redacted, with exemptions referencing the National Security Act of 1947.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;958&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;xsbtzy6ppcy3zwxfe1y6&quot; data-format=&quot;png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, the document references two sets of email data labeled “Computer Science” and “CSSD” (“Appendix A” and “Appendix B,” respectively).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While “Computer Science” is admittedly ambiguous—though clearly related to an academic department somewhere—“CSSD” has special relevance to Pittsburgh. As University literature describes it, Computing Services and Systems Development (CSSD) has long provided the “network infrastructure and telecommunications backbone for the University community,” offering among other forms of support, computer resources and training to students and faculty members alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “CSSD” is also unique to the Pittsburgh campus. The University, which today accommodates more than 28,000 students and a staff of nearly 5,000, further describes it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Computing Services and Systems Development (CSSD) supports the teaching and research missions of the University by providing mechanisms (infrastructure, consulting, development and training) to students engaged in academic activities and to faculty in their laboratories and classrooms. CSSD is responsible for maintaining a contemporary IT environment, while exploring the next generation of technology, innovative computing, and telecommunication solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two pages of the document were released—a cover sheet and a second page pulled from one of the “email header” lists—so it is unclear precisely how much data the FBI may have acquired.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There are clues, however, that suggest it may have been a substantial amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page with Swartz’s email address is labeled page 26. When the FBI looked up the file, it noted the address was contained in Appendix A (“Computer Science”). So we know the first email header list takes up at least 26 pages, but maybe more. There is no reference to the size of Appendix B. The total size of the file, then, could be anywhere between 27 pages and 50 pages or 100 pages or 2,000—only the FBI knows for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrapper lazy-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-permalink-sub-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js_lightbox-wrapper lightbox-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; class=&quot;lazyload ls-lazy-image-tag&quot; data-sizes=&quot;auto&quot; data-width=&quot;943&quot; data-chomp-id=&quot;rie8f3bzaliyrh1hdeei&quot; data-format=&quot;png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear why Swartz was, presumably, in contact with a student or staff member in the PITT computer science department, though he is known to have been involved in multiple software development projects at the time, and had by then realized his own passion for collecting and sharing—frequently with other academics—datasets containing massive amounts of information, which he earnestly believed should be free and easily accessible to everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves,” he later wrote in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. “Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gizmodo contacted the university in early November. After a week, PITT said it was still “digging” into the matter. On November 20, Gizmodo informed PITT that it was planning to publish a story stating that the FBI obtained the communications data of staff and students in connection with a terrorism investigation. Following that, correspondence from the University ceased for over a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a later email raising the possibility that a National Security Letter was used to acquire to data on staff and students, a PITT spokesperson replied: “I’m afraid we have no comment.” The spokesperson would also not say whether the University had a policy of challenging the government gag orders that accompany NSLs, which are designed to prevent people and institutions from ever notifying the public about the letter’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;National Security Letters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the FBI would not have required a warrant to obtain the email headers from a public university. The Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks, significantly lowered the threshold for using NSLs and also made them much easier to acquire by expanding the number of FBI officials who could sign them. Today, the most senior agents at the FBI’s 56 nationwide field offices—special agents in charge (SAC)—are able to approve the use of an NSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSLs may be used to acquire sans warrant a range of consumer credit information and other transnational records. But importantly, the statute authorizing their use in cases of electronic communications—under Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act—do not permit the FBI to acquire the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of emails without a warrant. NSLs may be used, however, to acquire evidence in pursuit of secret warrants issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), for developing evidence prior to the initiation of a terrorism investigation, and to corroborate information obtained by other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the FBI informed Gizmodo that its use of such tools is governed by legal statutes and guidelines established by the U.S. Attorney General, the bureau has routinely &lt;a href=&quot;https://oig.justice.gov/testimony/t0909.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://oig.justice.gov/testimony/t0909.pdf', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;violated&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/06/23/op-olc-v032-p0145.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/06/23/op-olc-v032-p0145.pdf', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;misinterpreted&lt;/a&gt; those guidelines, according to the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel and the FBI’s own inspector general. Notably, these abuses were rampant around the time that the FBI appears to have acquired the PITT email data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2003 and 2006, the FBI reported the issuance of more than 192,000 letters, according to 2009 testimony before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. However, the FBI’s inspector general also &lt;a href=&quot;https://oig.justice.gov/testimony/t0909.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://oig.justice.gov/testimony/t0909.pdf ', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; that this figure was also inaccurately low.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A review of four field offices revealed the reported number of letters was, in fact, 22 percent lower than the actual number of letters issued. It also identified 26 possible intelligence violations, including the issuance of NSLs “without proper authorization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 77 FBI files, the inspector general found&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that 293 letters had been used. Of those, 22 possible violations were discovered that had not been previously reported. The violations included “improper requests under the pertinent national security letter statutes” and “unauthorized collections.” Moreover, some of the justifications used to obtain the letters were overly convenient and inherently flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI Pittsburgh Field Office, which requested the analysis of the email headers linked to Swartz, also has a “troubling” history with regard to the monitoring of peaceful activists, notes a 2010 inspector general &lt;a href=&quot;https://oig.justice.gov/special/s1009r.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://oig.justice.gov/special/s1009r.pdf', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to suspicions of illegal spying on anti-war activists raised by California Representative Zoe Lofgren, the FBI launched an internal investigation to determine whether it had targeted “domestic advocacy groups” based solely on activities protected under the First Amendment. Notably, even the issuance of an NSL cannot be based solely on observations of constitutionally protected speech. (Lofgren is, incidentally, the author of Aaron’s Law, a bill that sought to reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, under which Swartz was charged prior to his death. The bill did not pass.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was determined that in 2006, then-FBI Director Robert Mueller falsely claimed—the FBI says unwittingly—that an FBI agent had attended an anti-war rally in Pittsburgh while following up on a solid terrorism lead. The claim corresponded with a document produced by the Pittsburgh Field Office, which stated a prominent Muslim had become “of interest” to the FBI and that the agent was sent to monitor him at the rally. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-fbi/report-criticizes-fbi-probes-of-activists-idUSTRE68J42020100920&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-fbi/report-criticizes-fbi-probes-of-activists-idUSTRE68J42020100920', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;none of it was true&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence linking the man to terrorism and no one in the Pittsburgh Field Office “had any reason to believe” he would be attending the rally, an investigation found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fundamental issue with an NSL, if one was used in this case, is that the FBI can issue it on its own discretion and can collect pretty sensitive information, such as email headers,” said attorney Gabe Rottman, director of the Reporters Committee’s technology and press freedom project. At the time, he notes, the FBI also claimed the authority to collect arguably more sensitive data, including a target’s web browsing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s particularly worrying, he said, that without a warrant, the FBI is able to stockpile sensitive information about U.S. citizens, whether they’ve been suspected of a crime or not, only to eventually use that information against them years later in some totally unrelated way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just as Aaron Swartz’s email was apparently picked up here, you could, for instance, have a reporter or some source information scooped up and mined later,” he said. “And that’s a matter of great concern.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Write Your Own Virtual Machine</title>
<link>https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;76.738948250576&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048&quot;&gt;2048&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue&quot;&gt;Roguelike&lt;/a&gt;. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/lc3.c&quot;&gt;final code&lt;/a&gt; is about 250 lines of C. All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html&quot;&gt;binary arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;. To build and run the code, you will need to be on a Unix system (including macOS). A few Unix APIs are used for configuring the terminal input and display, but these are not essential to the main code. (Contributions for Windows support are welcome.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.2779783393502&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This VM is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming&quot;&gt;literate program&lt;/a&gt;. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was then created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate&quot;&gt;&quot;weaving&quot;&lt;/a&gt; the code blocks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a virtual machine?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can you can use to program it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games&quot;&gt;faithfully recreate&lt;/a&gt; every &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests&quot;&gt;detail&lt;/a&gt; and major hardware component of the original device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/no_vm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;architecture specific implementation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif&quot; alt=&quot;vm for each architecture&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard &lt;em&gt;high-level language&lt;/em&gt; to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard &lt;em&gt;CPU architecture&lt;/em&gt; which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine&quot;&gt;Java Virtual Machine (JVM)&lt;/a&gt; is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/&quot;&gt;further abstraction&lt;/a&gt; from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old &lt;a href=&quot;https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/&quot;&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt; often used small VMs to provide simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/&quot;&gt;scripting systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html&quot;&gt;is no trivial way&lt;/a&gt; to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection&quot;&gt;memory references&lt;/a&gt; on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html&quot;&gt;Ethereum smart contracts&lt;/a&gt;. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opprotunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine&quot;&gt;VM&lt;/a&gt; that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;102.82965046203&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. LC-3 Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3&quot;&gt;LC-3&lt;/a&gt;. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set &lt;a href=&quot;http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html&quot;&gt;compared to x86&lt;/a&gt;, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;2^{16}&lt;/span&gt;), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;8.53125&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Memory Storage &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;seealso&quot;&gt;Used in sections &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Registers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the &quot;workbench&quot; of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 general purpose registers (&lt;code&gt;R0&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;R7&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 program counter (&lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt;) register&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 condition flags (&lt;code&gt;COND&lt;/code&gt;) register&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;17.608695652174&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Registers &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;

{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Register Storage &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;seealso&quot;&gt;Used in sections &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instruction Set&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an &lt;strong&gt;opcode&lt;/strong&gt; which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of &lt;strong&gt;parameters&lt;/strong&gt; which provide inputs to the task being performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;strong&gt;opcode&lt;/strong&gt; represents one task that the CPU &quot;knows&quot; how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;24.832962138085&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Opcodes &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.8961937716263&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer&quot;&gt;RISCs&lt;/a&gt; while larger ones are called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer&quot;&gt;CISCs&lt;/a&gt;. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/&quot;&gt;often make it more convenient&lt;/a&gt; to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc&quot;&gt;in and out of style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Condition Flags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;R_COND&lt;/code&gt; register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as &lt;code&gt;if (x &amp;gt; 0) { ... }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;51.180620155039&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Assembly Examples&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at an LC-3 assembly program to get an idea of what the VM actually runs. You don't need to know how to program assembly or understand everything that is going on. Just try to get a general idea of what is going on. Here is a simple &quot;Hello World&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;10.96918767507&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Hello World Assembly &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
.ORIG x3000                        ; this is the address in memory where the program will be loaded
LEA R0, HELLO_STR                  ; load the address of the HELLO_STR string into R0
PUTs                               ; output the string pointed to by R0 to the console
HALT                               ; halt the program
HELLO_STR .STRINGZ &quot;Hello World!&quot;  ; store this string here in the program
.END                               ; mark the end of the file
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like in C, the program starts at the top and executes one statement at a time. However, unlike C, there are no nested scopes &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; or control structures such as &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;; just a flat list of statements. This makes it much easier to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that some of the statements have names which match the opcodes we defined earlier. Previously, we learned that every instruction was 16 bits, but each line looks like it is a different number of characters. How is this inconsistency possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the code we are reading is written in &lt;strong&gt;assembly&lt;/strong&gt; which is a human-readable and writable form, encoded in plain text. A tool called an &lt;strong&gt;assembler&lt;/strong&gt; is used to transform each line of text into a 16-bit binary instruction the VM can understand. This binary form, which is essentially an array of 16-bit instructions, is called &lt;strong&gt;machine code&lt;/strong&gt; and is what the VM actually runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/assembler.gif&quot; alt=&quot;assembler diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Although a compiler and an assembler play a similar role in development, they are not the same. An assembler simply encodes what the programmer has written in text into binary, replacing symbols with their binary representation and packing them into instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commands &lt;code&gt;.ORIG&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.STRINGZ&lt;/code&gt; look like instructions but they aren't. They are assembler directives which generate a piece of code or data. For example, the &lt;code&gt;.STRINGZ&lt;/code&gt; inserts a string of characters into the program binary at the location it is written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loops and conditions are done with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto&quot;&gt;goto&lt;/a&gt;-like instruction. Here is another example which counts to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;14.942307692308&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Loop Assembly &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
AND R0, R0, 0                      ; clear R0
LOOP                               ; label at the top of our loop
ADD R0, R0, 1                      ; add 1 to R0 and store back in R0
ADD R1, R0, -10                    ; subtract 10 from R0 and store back in R1
BRn LOOP                           ; go back to LOOP if the result was negative
... ; R0 is now 10!
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.5348837209302&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Learning to write assembly is not necessary for this tutorial. However, if you are interested, you can write and assemble your own LC-3 programs using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html&quot;&gt;LC-3 Tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;49.800449269936&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Executing Programs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the previous examples are just to give you an idea of what the VM does. To write a VM, you don't need to be fluent in assembly. As long as you follow the proper procedure for reading and executing instructions, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; LC-3 program will run correctly, no matter how complicated it is. In theory, it could even run a web browser or an operating system like Linux!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about this property deeply, it is a philosophically remarkable idea. The programs themselves can do all kinds of intelligent things that we never anticipated and may not be able to understand, but at the same time, everything they can do is limited to the simple code we will write! We simultaneously know everything and nothing about how each program works. Turing discussed this marvelous idea idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.631578947368&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due, I believe, to a fallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians are particularly subject. This is the assumption that as soon as a fact is presented to a mind all consequences of that fact spring into the mind simultaneously with it. It is a very useful assumption under many circumstances, but one too easily forgets that it is false.&quot; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mind/article-pdf/LIX/236/433/9866119/433.pdf&quot;&gt;Alan M. Turing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a precise description of the procedure we need to write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Load one instruction from memory at the address of the &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt; register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increment the &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt; register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the &lt;em&gt;opcode&lt;/em&gt; to determine which type of instruction it should perform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the instruction using the parameters in the instruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to step 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering, &quot;if the loop keeps incrementing the &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt;, and we don't have &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, won't it quickly run out of instructions?&quot; The answer is no. As we mentioned before, some goto-like instructions change the execution flow by jumping the &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt; around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start outlining this process in the main loop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;27.197007481297&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Main Loop &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;150.35544531611&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Implementing Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your task now is to fill in each opcode case with a correct implementation. A detailed specification for each instruction is included in the project &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/docs/lc3-isa.pdf&quot;&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to learn how each instruction works from its specification and write an implementation. This is easier than it sounds. I will demonstrate how to implement two of them here. The code for the rest can be found in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ADD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; instruction takes two numbers, adds them together, and stores the result in a register. The specification for it is found on page 526. Each &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; instruction looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/add_layout.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Add Encoding&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encoding shows two rows because there are two different &quot;modes&quot; for this instruction. Before I explain modes, let's try to find the similarities between them. In both rows, we can see that we start with 4 bits, &lt;code&gt;0001&lt;/code&gt;. This is the opcode value for &lt;code&gt;OP_ADD&lt;/code&gt;. The next 3 bits are marked &lt;code&gt;DR&lt;/code&gt;. This stands for destination register. The destination register is where the added sum will be stored. The next 3 bits are &lt;code&gt;SR1&lt;/code&gt;. This is the register containing the first number to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we know where we want to store the result and we know the first number to add. The last bit of information we need is the second number to add. At this point, the two rows start to look different. Notice that on the top row the 5th bit is a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and in the second row it is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. This bit indicates whether it is &lt;em&gt;immediate mode&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;register mode&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;register mode&lt;/em&gt;, the second number is stored in a register just like the first. This is marked &lt;code&gt;SR2&lt;/code&gt; and is contained in bits 2-0. Bits 3 and 4 are unused. In assembly this would be written as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;6.9186046511628&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Add Register Assembly &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
ADD R2 R0 R1 ; add the contents of R0 to R1 and store in R2.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In immediate mode, instead of adding the contents of a register, the value is embedded in the instruction itself. This is convenient because the program doesn't need more instructions to load that number into the register from memory. Instead, it is right inside the instruction when we need it. The tradeoff is that it can only store a small number &lt;span class=&quot;math&quot;&gt;2^{5}=32&lt;/span&gt; (unsigned) to be exact. This is most useful for incrementing a value. In assembly, it could be written as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;6.9041095890411&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Add Immediate Assembly &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
ADD R0 R0 1 ; add 1 to R0 and store back in R0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary from the specification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If bit [5] is 0, the second source operand is obtained from &lt;code&gt;SR2&lt;/code&gt;. If bit [5] is 1, the second source operand is obtained by sign-extending the &lt;code&gt;imm5&lt;/code&gt; field to 16 bits. In either case, the second source operand and the contents of &lt;code&gt;SR1&lt;/code&gt; are bitwise ANDed, and the result stored in DR. (Pg. 526)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds just like what we discussed. But what is &quot;sign-extending&quot;? Although the immediate mode value has only 5 bits, it needs to be added to a 16-bit number. Those 5 bits need to be extended to 16 to match the other number. For positive numbers, we can fill in 0's for the additional bits and the value is the same. However, for negative numbers, this causes a problem. For example, -1 stored in 5 bits is &lt;code&gt;1 1111&lt;/code&gt;. If we just extended it with 0's, this is &lt;code&gt;0000 0000 0001 1111&lt;/code&gt; which is equal to 32! Sign extension prevents this problem by filling in 0's for positive numbers and 1's for negative numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;8.83125&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Sign Extend &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
uint16_t sign_extend(uint16_t x, int bit_count)
{
    if ((x &amp;gt;&amp;gt; (bit_count - 1)) &amp;amp; 1) {
        x |= (0xFFFF &amp;lt;&amp;lt; bit_count);
    }
    return x;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.4418604651163&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are interested in exactly how negative numbers can be represented in binary, you can read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement&quot;&gt;Two's Complement&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is not essential. You can just copy the code above and use it whenever the specification says to sign extend numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one last sentence in the specification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition codes are set based on whether the binary value produced, taken as a 2’s complement integer, is negative, zero, or positive. (Pg. 526)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier we defined a condition flags enum, and now it's time to use them. &lt;em&gt;Any time&lt;/em&gt; a value is written to a register, we need to update the flags to indicate its sign. We will write a function so that this can be reused:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;8.8884297520661&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Update Flags &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
void update_flags(uint16_t r)
{
    if (reg[r] == 0)
    {
        reg[R_COND] = FL_ZRO;
    }
    else if (reg[r] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 15) /* a 1 in the left-most bit indicates negative */
    {
        reg[R_COND] = FL_NEG;
    }
    else
    {
        reg[R_COND] = FL_POS;
    }
}

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to write the code for the &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;10.945945945946&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{ADD &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
{
    /* destination register (DR) */
    uint16_t r0 = (instr &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 9) &amp;amp; 0x7;
    /* first operand (SR1) */
    uint16_t r1 = (instr &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6) &amp;amp; 0x7;
    /* whether we are in immediate mode */
    uint16_t imm_flag = (instr &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5) &amp;amp; 0x1;

    if (imm_flag)
    {
        uint16_t imm5 = sign_extend(instr &amp;amp; 0x1F, 5);
        reg[r0] = reg[r1] + imm5;
    }
    else
    {
        uint16_t r2 = instr &amp;amp; 0x7;
        reg[r0] = reg[r1] + reg[r2];
    }

    update_flags(r0);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;seealso&quot;&gt;Used in section &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section contained a lot of information, so let's summarize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt; takes two values and stores them in a register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In register mode, the second value to add is found in a register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In immediate mode, the second value is embedded in the right-most 5 bits of the instruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Values which are shorter than 16 bits need to be sign extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any time an instruction modifies a register, the condition flags need to be updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be feeling overwhelmed about writing 15 more instructions. However, all of what you learned here will be reused. Most of the instructions use some combination of sign extension, different modes, and updating flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LDI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LDI&lt;/code&gt; stands for &quot;load indirect.&quot; This instruction is used to load a value from a location in memory into a register. The specification is found on page 532.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the binary layout looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/ldi_layout.gif&quot; alt=&quot;LDI Encoding&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, there are no modes and fewer parameters. This time, the opcode is &lt;code&gt;1010&lt;/code&gt; which corresponds with the &lt;code&gt;OP_LDI&lt;/code&gt; enum value. Just like &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;, it contains a 3-bit &lt;code&gt;DR&lt;/code&gt; (the destination register) for storing the loaded value. The remaining bits are labeled &lt;code&gt;PCoffset9&lt;/code&gt;. This is an immediate value embedded in the instruction (similar to &lt;code&gt;imm5&lt;/code&gt;). Since this instruction loads from memory, we can guess that this number is some kind of address which tells us where to load from. The specification provides more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An address is computed by sign-extending bits &lt;code&gt;[8:0]&lt;/code&gt; to 16 bits and adding this value to the incremented &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt;. What is stored in memory at this address is the address of the data to be loaded into &lt;code&gt;DR&lt;/code&gt;. (Pg. 532)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like before, we need to sign extend this 9-bit value, but this time add it to the current &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt;. (If you look back at the execution loop, the &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt; was incremented right after this instruction was loaded.) The resulting sum is an address to a location in memory, and that address &lt;em&gt;contains, yet another&lt;/em&gt; value which is the address of the value to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a roundabout way to read from memory, but it is indispensable. The &lt;code&gt;LD&lt;/code&gt; instruction is limited to address offsets that are 9 bits, whereas the memory requires 16 bits to address. &lt;code&gt;LDI&lt;/code&gt; is useful for loading values that are stored in locations far away from the current PC, but to use it, the address of the final location needs to be stored in a neighborhood nearby. You can think of it like having a local variable in C which is a pointer to some data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;9.9722991689751&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{C LDI Sample &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
// the value of far_data is an address
// of course far_data itself (the location in memory containing the address) has an address
char* far_data = &quot;apple&quot;; 

// In memory it may be layed out like this:

// Address Label      Value
// 0x123:  far_data = 0x456
// ...
// 0x456:  string   = 'a'

// if PC was at 0x100
// LDI R0 0x023
// would load 'a' into R0
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as before, the flags need to be updated after putting the value into &lt;code&gt;DR&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition codes are set based on whether the value loaded is negative, zero, or positive. (Pg. 532)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for this case: (&lt;code&gt;mem_read&lt;/code&gt; will be discussed in a later section.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;11.961165048544&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{LDI &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
{
    /* destination register (DR) */
    uint16_t r0 = (instr &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 9) &amp;amp; 0x7;
    /* PCoffset 9*/
    uint16_t pc_offset = sign_extend(instr &amp;amp; 0x1ff, 9);
    /* add pc_offset to the current PC, look at that memory location to get the final address */
    reg[r0] = mem_read(mem_read(reg[R_PC] + pc_offset));
    update_flags(r0);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, this instruction shared a lot of the code and knowledge learned from &lt;code&gt;ADD&lt;/code&gt;. You will find this is the case with the remaining instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now need to go back and implement the rest of the switch cases for the instructions. Follow the specification and use the code listed here to complete the others. The code for all instructions is listed at the end of the tutorial. Two of the opcodes specified before will not be used, they are &lt;code&gt;OP_RTI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OP_RES&lt;/code&gt;. You can ignore these cases or throw an error if they are executed. After you are done, the bulk of your VM will be completed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;89.25284629981&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Trap Routines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LC-3 provides a few predefined routines for performing common tasks and interacting with I/O devices. For example, there are routines for getting input from the keyboard and for displaying strings to the console. These are called &lt;em&gt;trap routines&lt;/em&gt; which you can think of as the operating system or API for the LC-3. Each trap routine is assigned a &lt;em&gt;trap code&lt;/em&gt; which identifies it (similar to an opcode). To execute one, the &lt;code&gt;TRAP&lt;/code&gt; instruction is called with the trap code of the desired routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/trap_layout.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Trap Encoding&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define an enum for each trap code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;15.744408945687&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{TRAP Codes &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
enum
{
    TRAP_GETC = 0x20,  /* get character from keyboard */
    TRAP_OUT = 0x21,   /* output a character */
    TRAP_PUTS = 0x22,  /* output a word string */
    TRAP_IN = 0x23,    /* input a string */
    TRAP_PUTSP = 0x24, /* output a byte string */
    TRAP_HALT = 0x25   /* halt the program */
};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;seealso&quot;&gt;Used in sections &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why the trap codes are not included in the instructions. This is because they do not actually introduce any new functionality to the LC-3, they just provide a convenient way to perform a task (similar to system functions in C). In the official LC-3 simulator, trap routines are &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/docs/os.asm&quot;&gt;written in assembly&lt;/a&gt;. When a trap code is called, the &lt;code&gt;PC&lt;/code&gt; is moved to that code's address. The CPU executes instructions of the procedure, and when it is complete, the PC is reset to the location the trap was called from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is why programs start at address &lt;code&gt;0x3000&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;0x0&lt;/code&gt;. The lower addresses are left empty to leave space for the trap routine code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specification for &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; trap routines must be implemented, only what they are supposed to do. In our VM, we are going to do things slightly differently by writing them in C. When a trap code is invoked, a C function will be called. When it is completed, execution will return to the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the trap routines can be written in assembly and this is what a physical LC-3 computer would do, it isn't the best fit for a VM. Instead of writing our own primitive I/O routines, we can take advantage of the ones available on our OS. This will make the VM run better on our computers, simplify the code, and provide a higher level of abstraction for portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting input from the keyboard is one specific example of this. The assembly version uses a loop to continuously check the keyboard for input. This consumes a lot of CPU time for nothing! Using a proper OS input function allows the program to sleep until input is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the switch case form the &lt;code&gt;TRAP&lt;/code&gt; opcode, add another switch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;16.401408450704&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{TRAP &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        break;
    case TRAP_HALT:

        break;
}

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with instructions, I will show you how to implement a single trap routine and leave the rest to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PUTS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PUTS&lt;/code&gt; trap code is used to output a null-terminated string (similar to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; in C). The specification is found on page 543.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To display a string, we must give the trap routine a string to display. This is done by storing the address of the first character in &lt;code&gt;R0&lt;/code&gt; before beginning the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specification says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a string of ASCII characters to the console display. The characters are contained in consecutive memory locations, one character per memory location, starting with the address specified in &lt;code&gt;R0&lt;/code&gt;. Writing terminates with the occurrence of &lt;code&gt;x0000&lt;/code&gt; in a memory location. (Pg. 543)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that unlike C strings, characters are &lt;em&gt;not stored&lt;/em&gt; in a single byte, but in a &lt;em&gt;single memory location&lt;/em&gt;. Memory locations in LC-3 are 16 bits, so each character in the string is 16 bits wide. To display this with a C function, we will need to convert each value to a char and output them individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;8.9333333333333&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{TRAP PUTS &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
{
    /* one char per word */
    uint16_t* c = memory + reg[R_R0];
    while (*c)
    {
        putc((char)*c, stdout);
        ++c;
    }
    fflush(stdout);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this routine. The trap routines are pretty straightforward if you are familiar with C. Go back to the specification and implement the others now. As with the instructions, the full code can be found at the end of the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;10. Loading Programs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have mentioned a lot about loading and executing instructions from memory, but how do instructions get into memory in the first place? When an assembly program is converted to machine code, the result is a file containing an array of instructions and data. This can be loaded by just copying the contents right into an address in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 16 bits of the program file specify the address in memory where the program should start. This address is called the &lt;strong&gt;origin&lt;/strong&gt;. It must be read first, after which the rest of the data can be read from the file into memory starting at the origin address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for reading an LC-3 program into memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codeblock&quot; readability=&quot;15.868041237113&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;codeblock_name&quot;&gt;{Read Image File &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
void read_image_file(FILE* file)
{
    /* the origin tells us where in memory to place the image */
    uint16_t origin;
    fread(&amp;amp;origin, sizeof(origin), 1, file);
    origin = swap16(origin);

    /* we know the maximum file size so we only need one fread */
    uint16_t max_read = UINT16_MAX - origin;
    uint16_t* p = memory + origin;
    size_t read = fread(p, sizeof(uint16_t), max_read, file);

    /* swap to little endian */
    while (read-- &amp;gt; 0)
    {
        *p = swap16(*p);
        ++p;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;seealso&quot;&gt;Used in section &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that &lt;code&gt;swap16&lt;/code&gt; is called on each loaded value. LC-3 programs are big-endian, but most of the modern computers we use are little endian. As a result, we need to swap each &lt;code&gt;uint16&lt;/code&gt; that is loaded. (If you happen to be using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube&quot;&gt;strange computer&lt;/a&gt;, like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC#Endian_modes&quot;&gt;PPC&lt;/a&gt; then you should not swap.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness&quot;&gt;Endianness&lt;/a&gt; refers to how bytes of an integer are interpreted. In little-endian, the first byte is the least significant digit, and in big-endian, it is reversed. As far as I know, the decision is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; arbitrary. Different companies made different decisions, so now we are left with varying implementations. You do not need to know anything else about endianness for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;11. Memory Mapped Registers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some special registers are not accessible from the normal register table. Instead, a special address is reserved for them in memory. To read and write to these registers, you just read and write to their memory location. These are called &lt;strong&gt;memory mapped registers&lt;/strong&gt;. They are commonly used to interact with special hardware devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LC-3 has two memory mapped registers that need to be implemented. They are the keyboard status register (&lt;code&gt;KBSR&lt;/code&gt;) and keyboard data register (&lt;code&gt;KBDR&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;KBSR&lt;/code&gt; indicates whether a key has been pressed, and the &lt;code&gt;KBDR&lt;/code&gt; identifies which key was pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you can request keyboard input using &lt;code&gt;GETC&lt;/code&gt;, this blocks execution until input is received. &lt;code&gt;KBSR&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;KBDR&lt;/code&gt; allows you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;poll the state&lt;/a&gt; of the device and continue execution, so the program can stay responsive while waiting for input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory mapped registers make memory access a bit more complicated. We can't read and write to the memory array directly, but must instead call setter and getter functions. When memory is read from &lt;code&gt;KBSR&lt;/code&gt;, the getter will check the keyboard and update both memory locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Debugging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the program doesn't work correctly, it is likely because you programmed an instruction incorrectly. This can be tricky to debug. I recommend reading through the assembly source code of an LC-3 program while simultaneously using a debugger to step through the VM instructions one at a time. As you read the assembly, make sure the VM goes to the instruction that you expect it to. If a discrepancy occurs, you will then know which instruction caused the issue. Reread its specification and double check your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; readability=&quot;54.684695512821&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;14. Alternate C++ Technique&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section shows an advanced way of executing instructions that makes the code a whole lot smaller. This section is entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since C++ has powerful compile-time generics, we can use the compiler to generate parts of the instructions for us. This method reduces code duplication and is actually closer to how the computer would be wired in hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to reuse the steps common to each instruction. For example, several of the instructions use indirect addressing or sign extend a value and add it to the current PC value. Wouldn't it be nice if we could write this code once for all instructions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By thinking of the instruction as a pipeline of steps we can see that each instruction is just a permuation of several of the smaller steps. We will use bitwise flags to mark which steps to perform for each instruction. A &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; in the bit corresponding to the instruction number indicates the compiler should include this section of code for that instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask</title>
<link>https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;By Mike Malone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;publish-date&quot;&gt;December 11, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates and public key infrastructure (PKI) are hard. No shit, right? I know a lot of smart people who’ve avoided this particular rabbit hole. Personally, I avoided it for a long time and felt some shame for not knowing more. The obvious result was a vicious cycle: I was too embarrassed to ask questions so I never learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was forced to learn this stuff because of what it enables: PKI lets you define a system cryptographically. It’s universal and vendor neutral. It works everywhere so bits of your system can run anywhere and communicate securely. It’s conceptually simple and super flexible. It lets you &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallstep.com/blog/use-tls.html&quot;&gt;use TLS&lt;/a&gt; and ditch VPNs. You can ignore everything about your network and still have strong security characteristics. It’s pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have learned, I regret not doing so sooner. PKI is really powerful, and really interesting. The math is complicated, and the standards are stupidly baroque, but the core concepts are actually quite simple. Certificates are the best way to identify code and devices, and identity is super useful for security, monitoring, metrics, and a million other things. Using certificates is not that hard. No harder than learning a new language or database. It’s just slightly annoying and poorly documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the missing manual. I reckon most engineers can wrap their heads around all the most important concepts and common quirks in less than an hour. That’s our goal here. An hour is a pretty small investment to learn something you literally can’t do any other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My motives are mostly didactic. But I’ll be using two open source projects we built at smallstep in various demonstrations: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallstep.com/cli&quot;&gt;step CLI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallstep.com/certificates&quot;&gt;step certificates&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to follow along you can &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install smallstep/smallstep/cli&lt;/code&gt; to get both (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smallstep/cli#installing&quot;&gt;full install instructions here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a one sentence tl;dr: the goal of certificates and PKI is to bind names to public keys. That’s it. The rest is just implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-broad-overview-and-some-words-you-should-know&quot;&gt;A broad overview and some words you should know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to use some technical terms, so let’s go ahead and define them before we start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;entity&lt;/strong&gt; is anything that exists, even if it only exists logically or conceptually. Your computer is an entity. So is some code you wrote. So are you. So is the burrito you ate for lunch. So is the ghost that you saw when you were six – even if your mom was right and it was just a figment of your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every entity has an &lt;strong&gt;identity&lt;/strong&gt;. This one’s hard to define. Identity is what makes you you, ya know? On computers identity is usually represented as a bag of attributes describing some entity: group, age, location, favorite color, shoe size, whatever. An &lt;strong&gt;identifier&lt;/strong&gt; is not the same as an identity. Rather, it’s a unique reference to some entity that has an identity. I’m Mike, but Mike isn’t my identity. It’s a &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; – identifier and name are synonyms (at least for our purposes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entities can &lt;strong&gt;claim&lt;/strong&gt; that they have some particular name. Other entities might be able to authenticate that claim, confirming its truth. But a claim needn’t be related to a name: I can make a claim about anything: my age, your age, access rights, the meaning of life, etc. &lt;strong&gt;Authentication&lt;/strong&gt;, in general, is the process of confirming the truth of some claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;subscriber&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;end entity&lt;/strong&gt; is an entity that’s participating in a PKI and can be the &lt;strong&gt;subject&lt;/strong&gt; of a certificate. A &lt;strong&gt;certificate authority&lt;/strong&gt; (CA) is an entity that issues certificates to subscribers — a certificate &lt;strong&gt;issuer&lt;/strong&gt;. Certificates that belong to subscribers are sometimes called end entity certificates or &lt;strong&gt;leaf certificates&lt;/strong&gt; for reasons that’ll become clearer once we discuss certificate chains. Certificates that belong to CAs are usually called &lt;strong&gt;root certificates&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;intermediate certificates&lt;/strong&gt; depending on the sort of CA. Finally, a &lt;strong&gt;relying party&lt;/strong&gt; is a certificate user that verifies and trusts certificates issued by a CA. To confuse matters a bit, an entity can be both a subscriber and a relying party. That is, a single entity can have its own certificate and use other certificates to authenticate remote peers (this is what happens with mutual TLS, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s enough to get us started, but if pedagogy excites you consider putting &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949&quot;&gt;RFC 4949&lt;/a&gt; on your kindle. For everyone else, let’s get concrete. How do we make claims and authenticate stuff in practice? Let’s talk crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;macs-and-signatures-authenticate-stuff&quot;&gt;MACs and signatures authenticate stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;message authentication code&lt;/strong&gt; (MAC) is a bit of data that’s used to verify which entity sent a message, and to ensure that a message hasn’t been modified. The basic idea is to feed a shared secret (a password) along with a message through a hash function. The hash output is a MAC. You send the MAC along with the message to some recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recipient that also knows the shared secret can produce their own MAC and compare it to the one provided. Hash functions have a simple contract: if you feed them the same input twice you’ll get the exact same output. If the input is different – even by a single bit – the output will be totally different. So if the recipient’s MAC matches the one sent with the message it can be confident that the message was sent by another entity that knows the shared secret. Assuming only trusted entities know the shared secret, the recipient can trust the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hash functions are also one-way: it’s computationally infeasible to take the output of a hash function and reconstruct its input. This is critical to maintaining the confidentiality of a shared secret: otherwise some interloper could snoop your MACs, reverse your hash function, and figure out your secrets. That’s no good. Whether this property holds depends critically on subtle details of how hash functions are used to build MACs. Subtle details that I’m not going to get into here. So beware: don’t try to invent your own MAC algorithm. Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC&quot;&gt;HMAC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-hmac.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;HMAC&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this talk of MACs is prologue: our real store starts with &lt;em&gt;signatures&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;strong&gt;signature&lt;/strong&gt; is conceptually similar to a MAC, but instead of using a shared secret you use a key pair (defined soon). With a MAC, at least two entities need to know the shared secret: the sender and the recipient. A valid MAC could have been generated by either party, and you can’t tell which. Signatures are different. A signature can be verified using a public key but can only be generated with a corresponding private key. Thus, a recipient that only has a public key can verify signatures, but can’t generate them. This gives you tighter control over who can sign stuff. If only one entity knows the private key you get a property called &lt;strong&gt;non-repudiation&lt;/strong&gt;: the private key holder can’t deny (repudiate) the fact that they signed some data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re already confused, chill. They’re called signatures for a reason: they’re just like signatures in the real world. You have some stuff you want someone to agree to? You want to make sure you can prove they’ve agreed later on? Cool. Write it down and have them sign it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-key-cryptography-lets-computers-see&quot;&gt;Public key cryptography lets computers see&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates and PKI are built on &lt;strong&gt;public key cryptography&lt;/strong&gt; (also called &lt;strong&gt;asymmetric cryptography&lt;/strong&gt;), which uses &lt;strong&gt;key pairs&lt;/strong&gt;. A key pair consists of a &lt;strong&gt;public key&lt;/strong&gt; that can be distributed and shared with the world, and a corresponding &lt;strong&gt;private key&lt;/strong&gt; that should be kept confidential by the owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s repeat that last part because it’s important: the security of a public key cryptosystem depends on keeping private keys private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two things you can do with a key pair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;encrypt&lt;/strong&gt; some data with the public key. The only way to decrypt that data is with the corresponding private key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;sign&lt;/strong&gt; some data with the private key. Anyone who knows the corresponding public key can verify the signature, proving which private key produced it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography is a magical gift from mathematics to computer science. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz//~sgal018/crypto-book/crypto-book.html&quot;&gt;The math&lt;/a&gt; is complicated, for sure, but you don’t need to understand it to appreciate its value. Public key cryptography lets computers do something that’s otherwise impossible: &lt;strong&gt;public key cryptography lets computers see&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let me explain… public key cryptography lets one computer (or bit of code) prove to another that it knows something without sharing that knowledge directly. To prove you know a password you have to share it. Whoever you share it with can use it themselves. Not so with a private key. It’s like vision. If you know what I look like you can tell who I am – authenticate my identity – by looking at me. But you can’t shape-shift to impersonate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography does something similar. If you know my public key (what I look like) you can use it to see me across the network. You could send me a big random number, for example. I can sign your number and send you my signature. Verifying that signature is good evidence you’re talking to me. This effectively allows computers to see who they’re talking to across a network. This is so crazy useful we take it for granted in the real world. Across a network it’s straight magic. Thanks math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;certificates-drivers-licenses-for-computers-and-code&quot;&gt;Certificates: driver’s licenses for computers and code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you don’t already know my public key? That’s what certificates are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates are fundamentally &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; simple. A certificate is a data structure that contains a public key and a name. The data structure is then &lt;em&gt;signed&lt;/em&gt;. The signature &lt;em&gt;binds&lt;/em&gt; the public key to the name. The entity that signs a certificate is called the &lt;strong&gt;issuer&lt;/strong&gt; (or certificate authority) and the entity named in the certificate is called the &lt;strong&gt;subject&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Some Issuer&lt;/em&gt; signs a certificate for &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt;, that certificate can be interpreted as the statement: “&lt;em&gt;Some Issuer&lt;/em&gt; says &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt;’s public key is 01:23:42…“.This is a claim made by &lt;em&gt;Some Issuer&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt;. The claim is signed by &lt;em&gt;Some Issuer&lt;/em&gt;, so if you know &lt;em&gt;Some Issuer&lt;/em&gt;’s public key you can authenticate it by verifying the signature. If you trust &lt;em&gt;Some Issuer&lt;/em&gt; you can trust the claim. Thus, certificates let you use trust, and knowledge of an issuer’s public key, to learn another entity’s public key (in this case, &lt;em&gt;Bob&lt;/em&gt;’s). That’s it. Fundamentally, that’s all a certificate is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-drivers-license-cert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simplified Certificate&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates are like driver’s licenses or passports for computers and code. If you’ve never met me before, but you trust the DMV, you can use my license for authentication: verify that the license is valid (check hologram, etc), look at picture, look at me, read name. Computers use certificates to do the same thing: if you’ve never met some computer before, but you trust some certificate authority, you can use a certificate for authentication: verify that the certificate is valid (check signature, etc), look at public key, “look at private key” across network (as described above), read name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-license-vs-cert.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;License Compared to Certificate&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a quick look at a real certificate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-step-certificate-inspect.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Step Certificate Inspect&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea so I might have simplified the story a little bit. Like a driver’s license, there’s other stuff in certificates. Licenses say whether you’re an organ donor and whether you’re authorized to drive a commercial vehicle. Certificates say whether you’re a CA and whether your public key is supposed to be used for signing or encryption. Both also have expirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a bunch of detail here, but it doesn’t change what I said before: fundamentally, a certificate is just a thing that binds a public key to a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;x509-asn1-oids-der-pem-pkcs-oh-my&quot;&gt;X.509, ASN.1, OIDs, DER, PEM, PKCS, oh my…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at how certificates are represented as bits and bytes. This part actually is annoyingly complicated. In fact, I suspect that the esoteric and poorly defined manner in which certificates and keys are encoded is the source of most confusion and frustration around PKI in general. This stuff is dumb. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually when people talk about certificates without additional qualification they’re referring to X.509 v3 certificates. More specifically, they’re usually talking about the PKIX variant described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280&quot;&gt;RFC 5280&lt;/a&gt; and further refined by the CA/Browser Forum’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/&quot;&gt;Baseline Requirements&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, they’re referring to the sort of certificates that browsers understand and use for HTTPS (HTTP over TLS). There are other certificate formats. Notably, SSH and PGP both have their own. But we’re going to focus on X.509. If you can understand X.509 you’ll be able to figure everything else out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these certificates are so broadly supported – they have good libraries and whatnot – they’re frequently used in other contexts, too. They’re certainly the most common format for certificates issued by internal PKI (defined in a bit). Importantly, these certificates work out of the box with TLS and HTTPS clients and servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t fully appreciate X.509 without a small history lesson. X.509 was first standardized in 1988 as part of the broader X.500 project under the auspices of the ITU-T (the International Telecommunications Union’s standards body). X.500 was an effort by the telcos to build a global telephone book. That never happened, but vestiges remain. If you’ve ever looked at an X.509 certificate and wondered why something designed for the web encodes a locality, state, and country here’s your answer: X.509 wasn’t designed for the web. It was designed thirty years ago to build a phone book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-cert-distinguished-name.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Distinguised Name Close-Up&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X.509 builds on ASN.1, another ITU-T standard (defined by X.208 and X.680). ASN stands for Abstract Syntax Notation (1 stands for One). ASN.1 is a notation for defining data types. You can think of it like JSON for X.509 but it’s actually more like protobuf or thrift or SQL DDL. RFC 5280 uses ASN.1 to define an X.509 certificate as an object that contains various bits of information: a name, key, signature, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASN.1 has normal data types like integers, strings, sets, and sequences. It also has an unusual type that’s important to understand: object identifiers (OIDs). An OID is like a URI, but more annoying. They’re (supposed to be) universally unique identifiers. Structurally, OIDs are a sequence of integers in a hierarchical namespace. You can use an OID to &lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em&gt; a bit of data with a type. A string is just a string, but if I tag a string with OID &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2.5.4.3&lt;/code&gt; then it’s no longer an ordinary string – it’s an X.509 &lt;em&gt;common name&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-oids.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OIDs Close-Up&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASN.1 is &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that the standard doesn’t say anything about how stuff should be represented as bits and bytes. For that there are various &lt;em&gt;encoding rules&lt;/em&gt; that specify concrete representations for ASN.1 data values. It’s an additional abstraction layer that’s supposed to be useful, but is mostly just annoying. It’s sort of like the difference between unicode and utf8 (eek).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One#Encodings&quot;&gt;a bunch of encoding rules&lt;/a&gt; for ASN.1, but there’s only one that’s commonly used for X.509 certificates and other crypto stuff: distinguished encoding rules or DER (though the non-canonical basic encoding rules (BER) are also occasionally used). DER is a pretty simple type-length-value encoding, but you really don’t need to worry about it since libraries will do most of the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the story doesn’t stop here. You don’t have to worry much about encoding and decoding DER but you &lt;em&gt;definitely will&lt;/em&gt; need to figure out whether a particular certificate is a plain DER-encoded X.509 certificate or something fancier. There are two potential dimensions of fanciness: we might be looking at something more than raw DER, and we might be looking at something more than just a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the former dimension, DER is straight binary, and binary data is hard to copy-paste and otherwise shunt around the web. So most certificates are packaged up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail&quot;&gt;PEM&lt;/a&gt; files (which stands for &lt;em&gt;Privacy Enhanced EMail&lt;/em&gt;, another weird historical vestige). If you’ve ever worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME&quot;&gt;MIME&lt;/a&gt;, PEM is similar: a base64 encoded payload sandwiched between a header and a footer. The PEM header has a label that’s supposed to describe the payload. Shockingly, this simple job is mostly botched and PEM labels are often inconsistent between tools (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468&quot;&gt;RFC 7468&lt;/a&gt; attempts to standardize the use of PEM in this context, but it’s not complete and not always followed). Without further ado, here’s what a PEM-encoded X.509 v3 certificate looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEM-encoded certificates will usually carry a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pem&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.crt&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.cer&lt;/code&gt; extension. A raw certificate encoded using DER will usually carry a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.der&lt;/code&gt; extension. Again, there’s not much consistency here, so your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to our other dimension of fanciness: in addition to fancier encoding using PEM, a certificate might be wrapped up in fancier packaging. Several &lt;em&gt;envelope formats&lt;/em&gt; define larger data structures (still using ASN.1) that can contain certificates, keys, and other stuff. Some things ask for “a certificate” when they really want a certificate in one of these envelopes. So beware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The envelope formats you’re likely to encounter are part of a suite of standards called PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards) published by RSA labs (actually the story is &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/73156/whats-the-difference-between-x-509-and-pkcs7-certificate&quot;&gt;slightly more complicated&lt;/a&gt;, but whatever). The first is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315&quot;&gt;PKCS#7&lt;/a&gt;, rebranded &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652&quot;&gt;Cryptographic Message Syntax&lt;/a&gt; (CMS) by IETF, which can contain one or more certificates (encoding a full certificate chain, described shortly). PKCS#7 is commonly used by Java. Common extensions are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.p7b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.p7c&lt;/code&gt;. The other common envelope format is &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292&quot;&gt;PKCS#12&lt;/a&gt; which can contain a certificate chain (like PKCS#7) along with an (encrypted) private key. PKCS#12 is commonly used by Microsoft products. Common extensions are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pfx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.p12&lt;/code&gt;. Again, the PKCS#7 and PKCS#12 envelopes also use ASN.1. That means both can be encoded as raw DER or BER or PEM. That said, in my experience they’re almost always raw DER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key encoding is similarly convoluted, but the pattern is generally the same: some ASN.1 data structure describes the key, DER is used as a binary encoding, and PEM (hopefully with a useful header) might be used as a slightly friendlier representation. Deciphering the sort of key you’re looking at is half art, half science. If you’re lucky &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468&quot;&gt;RFC 7468&lt;/a&gt; will give good guidance to figure out what your PEM payload is. Elliptic curve keys are usually labeled as such, though there &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5915#section-4&quot;&gt;doesn’t seem to be any standardization&lt;/a&gt;. Other keys are simply “PRIVATE KEY” by PEM. This usually indicates a &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208&quot;&gt;PKCS#8&lt;/a&gt; payload, an envelope for private keys that includes key type and other metadata. Here’s an example of a PEM-encoded elliptic curve key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also quite common to see private keys encrypted using a password (a shared secret or symmetric key). Those will look something like this (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Proc-Type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEK-Info&lt;/code&gt; are part of PEM and indicate that this PEM payload is encrypted using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AES-256-CBC&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKCS#8 objects can also be encrypted, in which case the header label should be “ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY” per RFC 7468. You won’t have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Proc-Type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dek-Info&lt;/code&gt; headers in this case as this information is encoded in the payload instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public keys will usually have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pub&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pem&lt;/code&gt; extension. Private keys may carry a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.prv,&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.key&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.pem&lt;/code&gt; extension. Once again, your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick summary. ASN.1 is used to define data types like certificates and keys. DER is a set of encoding rules for turning ASN.1 into bits and bytes. X.509 is defined in ASN.1. PKCS#7 and PKCS#12 are bigger data structures, also defined using ASN.1, that can contain certificates and other stuff. They’re commonly used by Java and Microsoft, respectively. Since raw binary DER is hard to shunt around the web most certificates are PEM-encoded, which base64 encodes the DER and labels it. Private keys are usually represented as PEM-encoded PKCS#8 objects. Sometimes they’re also encrypted with a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s confusing, it’s not you. It’s the world. I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-key-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Public Key Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to know what a certificate is, but that’s less than half the story. Let’s look at how certificates are created and used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public key infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; (PKI) is the umbrella term for all of the stuff we need in order to issue, distribute, store, use, verify, revoke, and otherwise manage and interact with certificates and keys. It’s an intentionally vague term, like “database infrastructure”. Certificates are the building blocks of most PKIs, and certificate authorities are the foundation. That said, PKI is so much more. It includes libraries, cron jobs, protocols, conventions, clients, servers, people, processes, names, discovery mechanisms, and all the other stuff you’ll need to use public key cryptography effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build your own PKI from scratch you’ll enjoy a ton of discretion. Just like if you build your own database infrastructure. In fact, many simple PKIs don’t even use certificates. When you edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; you’re configuring a simple certificate-less form of PKI that SSH uses to bind public keys to names in flat files. PGP uses certificates, but doesn’t use CAs. Instead it uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust&quot;&gt;web-of-trust&lt;/a&gt; model. You can even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko&quot;&gt;use a blockchain&lt;/a&gt; to assign names and bind them to public keys. The only thing that’s truly mandatory if you’re building a PKI from scratch is that, definitionally, you’ve got to be using public keys. Everything else can change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, you probably don’t want to build a PKI entirely from scratch. We’ll focus on the sort of PKI used on the web, and internal PKIs that are based on Web PKI technologies and leverage existing standards and components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we proceed remember the simple goal of certificates and PKI: to bind names to public keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-pki-vs-internal-pki&quot;&gt;Web PKI vs Internal PKI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You interact with Web PKI via your browser whenever you access an HTTPS URL — like when you loaded this website. This is the only PKI many people are (at least vaguely) familiar with. It creaks and clanks and bumbles along but it mostly works. Despite its problems, it substantially improves security on the web and it’s mostly transparent to users. You should use it everywhere your system communicates with the outside world over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web PKI&lt;/strong&gt; is mostly defined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280&quot;&gt;RFC 5280&lt;/a&gt; and refined by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/&quot;&gt;CA/Browser Forum&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a., CA/B or CAB Forum). It’s sometimes called “Internet PKI” or PKIX (after the working group that created it). The PKIX and CAB Forum documents cover a lot of ground. They define the variety of certificates we talked about in the last section. They also define what a “name” is and where it goes in a certificate, what signature algorithms can be used, how a relying party determines the issuer of a certificate, how a certificate’s validity period (issue and expiry dates) is specified, how revocation and certificate path validation works, the process that CAs use to determine whether someone owns a domain, and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web PKI is important because Web PKI certificates work by default with browsers and pretty much everything else that uses TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal PKI&lt;/strong&gt; is PKI you run yourself, for your own stuff: production infrastructure like services, containers, and VMs; enterprise IT applications; corporate endpoints like laptops and phones; and any other code or device you want to identify. It allows you to authenticate and establish cryptographic channels so your stuff can run anywhere and securely communicate, even across the public internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why run your own internal PKI if Web PKI already exists? The simple answer is that Web PKI wasn’t designed to support internal use cases. Even with a CA like &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, which offers free certificates and automated provisioning, you’ll have to deal with &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/&quot;&gt;rate limits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://statusgator.com/services/lets-encrypt&quot;&gt;availability&lt;/a&gt;. That’s no good if you have lots of services that you deploy all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, with Web PKI you have little or no control over important details like certificate lifetime, revocation mechanisms, renewal processes, key types, and algorithms (all important stuff we’ll explain in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the CA/Browser Forum &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/&quot;&gt;Baseline Requirements&lt;/a&gt; actually prohibit Web PKI CAs from binding internal IPs (e.g., stuff in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/code&gt;) or internal DNS names that aren’t fully-qualified and resolvable in public global DNS (e.g., you can’t bind a kubernetes cluster DNS name like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foo.ns.svc.cluster.local&lt;/code&gt;). If you want to bind this sort of name in a certificate, issue lots of certificates, or control certificate details, you’ll need your own internal PKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next section we’ll see that trust (or lack thereof) is yet &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; reason to avoid Web PKI for internal use. In short, use Web PKI for your public website and APIs. Use your own internal PKI for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;trust--trustworthiness&quot;&gt;Trust &amp;amp; Trustworthiness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;trust-stores&quot;&gt;Trust Stores&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier we learned to interpret a certificate as a statement, or claim, like: “&lt;em&gt;issuer says subject’s public key is blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt;”. This claim is signed by the issuer so it can be authenticated by relying parties. We glossed over something important in this description: how does the relying party know the &lt;em&gt;issuer&lt;/em&gt;’s public key?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple, if not satisfying: relying parties are pre-configured with a list of trusted &lt;strong&gt;root certificates&lt;/strong&gt; (or trust anchors) in a &lt;strong&gt;trust store&lt;/strong&gt;. The manner in which this pre-configuration occurs is an important aspect of any PKI. One option is to bootstrap off of another PKI: you could have some automation tool use SSH to copy root certificates to relying parties, leveraging the SSH PKI described earlier. If you’re running in the cloud your SSH PKI, in turn, is bootstrapped off of Web PKI plus whatever authentication your cloud vendor did when you created your account and gave them your credit card. If you follow this &lt;em&gt;chain of trust&lt;/em&gt; back far enough you’ll always find people: every trust chain ends in meatspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-chain-of-trust.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chain of Trust&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root certificates in trust stores are &lt;strong&gt;self-signed&lt;/strong&gt;. The issuer and the subject are the same. Logically it’s a statement like “&lt;em&gt;Mike&lt;/em&gt; says &lt;em&gt;Mike&lt;/em&gt;’s public key is &lt;em&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt;”. The signature on a self-signed certificate provides assurance that the subject/issuer knows the relevant private key, but anyone can generate a self-signed certificate with any name they want in it. So provenance is critical: a self-signed certificate should only be trusted insofar as the process by which it made its way into the trust store is trusted. On macOS the trust store is managed by the keychain. On many Linux distributions it’s simply some file(s) in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; or elsewhere on disk. If your users can modify these files you better trust all your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do trust stores come from? For Web PKI the most important relying parties are browsers. The trust stores used by default by the major browsers – and pretty much everything else that uses TLS – are maintained by four organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating system trust stores typically ship with the OS. Firefox ships with its own trust store (distributed using TLS from mozilla.org — bootstrapping off of Web PKI using some other trust store). Programming languages and other non-browser stuff like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; typically use the OS trust store by default. So the trust stores typically used by default by pretty much everything come pre-installed and are updated via software updates (which are usually code signed using yet another PKI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more than 100 certificate authorities commonly included in the trust stores maintained by these programs. You probably know the big ones: Let’s Encrypt, Symantec, DigiCert, Entrust, etc. It can be interesting to peruse them. If you’d like to do so programmatically, Cloudflare’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl&quot;&gt;cfssl&lt;/a&gt; project maintains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl_trust&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt; that includes the trusted certificates from various trust stores to assist with certificate bundling (which we’ll discuss momentarily). For a more human-friendly experience you can query &lt;a href=&quot;https://censys.io/&quot;&gt;Censys&lt;/a&gt; to see which certificates are trusted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://censys.io/certificates?q=validation.nss.valid%3A+true+AND+parsed.extensions.basic_constraints.is_ca%3A+true&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://censys.io/certificates?q=validation.apple.valid%3A+true+AND+parsed.extensions.basic_constraints.is_ca%3A+true&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://censys.io/certificates?q=validation.microsoft.valid%3A+true+AND+parsed.extensions.basic_constraints.is_ca%3A+true&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;trustworthiness&quot;&gt;Trustworthiness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 100+ certificate authorities are trusted in the descriptive sense — browsers and other stuff trust certificates issued by these CAs by default. But that doesn’t mean they’re &lt;em&gt;trustworthy&lt;/em&gt; in the moral sense. On the contrary, there are documented cases of Web PKI certificate authorities providing governments with fraudulent certificates in order to snoop on traffic and impersonate websites. Some of these “trusted” CAs operate out of authoritarian jurisdictions like China. Democracies don’t really have a moral high ground here, either. NSA takes every available opportunity to undermine Web PKI. In 2011 the “trusted” DigiNotar and Comodo certificate authorities were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar&quot;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comodo_Group#Certificate_hacking&quot;&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt;. The DigiNotar breach was probably NSA. There are also numerous examples of CAs mistakenly issuing malformed or non-compliant certificates. So while these CAs are de-facto trusted, as a group they’re empirically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trustworthy. We’ll soon see that Web PKI in general is only as secure as the least secure CA, so this is not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser community has taken some action to address this issue. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements rationalize the rules that these trusted certificate authorities are supposed to follow before issuing certificates. CAs are audited for compliance with these rules as part of the WebTrust audit program, which is required by some root certificate programs for inclusion in their trust stores (e.g., Mozilla’s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if you’re using TLS for internal stuff, you probably don’t want to trust these public CAs any more than you have to. If you do, you’re probably opening up the door to NSA and others. You’re accepting the fact that your security depends on the discipline and scruples of 100+ other organizations. Maybe you don’t care, but fair warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;federation&quot;&gt;Federation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, Web PKI relying parties (RPs) trust every CA in their trust store to sign certificates for any subscriber. The result is that the overall security of Web PKI is only as good as the least secure Web PKI CA. The 2011 DigiNotar attack demonstrated the problem here: as part of the attack a certificate was fraudulently issued for google.com. This certificate was trusted by major web browsers and operating systems despite the fact that Google had no relationship with DigiNotar. Dozens more fraudulent certificates were issued for companies like Yahoo!, Mozilla, and The Tor Project. DigiNotar root certificates were ultimately removed from the major trust stores, but a lot of damage had almost certainly already been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Sennheiser &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/asecuritysite-when-bob-met-alice/your-headphones-might-break-the-security-of-your-computer-4f304ed86611&quot;&gt;got called out for installing a self-signed root certificate&lt;/a&gt; in trust stores with their HeadSetup app, then embedding the corresponding private key in the app’s configuration. Anyone can extract this private key and use it to issue a certificate for any domain. Any computer that has the Sennheiser certificate in its trust store would trust these fraudulent certificates. This completely undermines TLS. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of mitigation mechanisms that can help reduce these risks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844&quot;&gt;Certificate Authority Authorization&lt;/a&gt; (CAA) allows you to restrict which CAs can issue certificates for your domain using a special DNS record. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.certificate-transparency.org/&quot;&gt;Certificate Transparency&lt;/a&gt; (CT) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962&quot;&gt;RFC 6962&lt;/a&gt;) mandates that CAs submit every certificate they issue to an impartial observer that maintains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://crt.sh/?Identity=smallstep.com&quot;&gt;public certificate log&lt;/a&gt; to detect fraudulently issued certificates. Cryptographic proof of CT submission is included in issued certificates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469&quot;&gt;HTTP Public Key Pinning&lt;/a&gt; (HPKP or just “pinning”) lets a subscriber (a website) tell an RP (a browser) to only accept certain public keys in certificates for a particular domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with all of these things is RP support, or lack thereof. The CAB Forum now mandates CAA checks in browsers. Some browsers also have some support for CT and HPKP. For other RPs (e.g., most TLS standard library implementations) this stuff is almost never enforced. This issue will come up repeatedly: a lot of certificate policy must be enforced by RPs, and RPs can rarely be bothered. If RPs don’t check CAA records and don’t require proof of CT submission this stuff doesn’t do much good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, if you run your own internal PKI you should maintain a separate trust store for internal stuff. That is, instead of adding your root certificate(s) to the existing system trust store, configure internal TLS requests to use only your roots. If you want better federation internally (e.g., you want to restrict which certificates your internal CAs can issue) you might try CAA records and properly configured RPs. You might also want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://spiffe.io/&quot;&gt;SPIFFE&lt;/a&gt;, an evolving standardization effort that addresses this problem and a number of others related to internal PKI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-a-certificate-authority&quot;&gt;What’s a Certificate Authority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked a lot about certificate authorities (CAs) but haven’t actually defined what one is. A CA is a trusted certificate issuer. It vouches for the binding between a public key and a name by signing a certificate. Fundamentally, a certificate authority is just another certificate and a corresponding private key that’s used to sign other certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously some logic and process needs to be wrapped around these artifacts. The CA needs to get its certificate distributed in trust stores, accept and process certificate requests, and issue certificates to subscribers. A CA that exposes remotely accessible APIs to automate this stuff it’s called an &lt;em&gt;online CA&lt;/em&gt;. A CA with a self-signed root certificate included in trust stores is called a &lt;em&gt;root CA&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;intermediates-chains-and-bundling&quot;&gt;Intermediates, Chains, and Bundling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-BR-1.6.1.pdf&quot;&gt;CAB Forum Baseline Requirements&lt;/a&gt; stipulate that a root private key belonging to a Web PKI root CA can only be used to sign a certificate by issuing a direct command (see section 4.3.1). In other words, Web PKI root CAs can’t automate certificate signing. They can’t be online. This is a problem for any large scale CA operation. You can’t have someone manually type a command into a machine to fulfill every certificate order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this stipulation is security. Web PKI root certificates are broadly distributed in trust stores and hard to revoke. Compromising a root CA private key would affect literally billions of people and devices. Best practice, therefore, is to keep root private keys offline, ideally on some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module&quot;&gt;specialized hardware&lt;/a&gt; connected to an air gapped machine, with good physical security, and with strictly enforced procedures for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many internal PKIs also follow these same practices, though it’s far less necessary. If you can automate root certificate rotation (e.g., update your trust stores using configuration management or orchestration tools) you can easily rotate a compromised root key. People obsess so much over root private key management for internal PKIs that it delays or prevents internal PKI deployment. Your AWS root account credentials are at least as sensitive, if not more. How do you manage those credentials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make certificate issuance scalable (i.e., to make automation possible) when the root CA isn’t online, the root private key is only used infrequently to sign a few &lt;em&gt;intermediate certificates&lt;/em&gt;. The corresponding &lt;em&gt;intermediate private keys&lt;/em&gt; are used by intermediate CAs (also called subordinate CAs) to sign and issue leaf certificates to subscribers. Intermediates aren’t generally included in trust stores, making them easier to revoke and rotate, so certificate issuance from an intermediate typically is online and automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;bundle&lt;/strong&gt; of certificates – leaf, intermediate, root – forms a chain (called a &lt;em&gt;certificate chain&lt;/em&gt;). The leaf is signed by the intermediate, the intermediate is signed by the root, and the root signs itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-cert-chain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Certificate Chain&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically this is another simplification. There’s nothing stopping you from creating longer chains and more complex graphs (e.g., by &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccertenroll/about-cross-certification&quot;&gt;cross-certification&lt;/a&gt;). This is generally discouraged though, as it can become very complicated very quickly. In any case, end entity certificates are leaf nodes in this graph. Hence the name “leaf certificate”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you configure a subscriber (e.g., a web server like Apache or Nginx or Linkerd or Envoy) you’ll typically need to provide not just the leaf certificate, but a certificate bundle that includes intermediate(s). PKCS#7 and PKCS#12 are sometimes used here because they can include a full certificate chain. More often, certificate chains are encoded as a simple sequence of line-separated PEM objects. Some stuff expects the certs to be ordered from leaf to root, other stuff expects root to leaf, and some stuff doesn’t care. More annoying inconsistency. Google and Stack Overflow help here. Or trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, annoying and baroque, but not rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;certificate-path-validation&quot;&gt;Certificate path validation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since intermediate certificates are not included in trust stores they need to be distributed and verified just like leaf certificates. You provide these intermediates when you configure subscribers, as described above. Then subscribers pass them along to RPs. With TLS this happens as part of the handshake that establishes a TLS connection. When a subscriber sends its certificate to a relying party it includes any intermediate(s) necessary to chain back up to a trusted root. The relying party verifies the leaf and intermediate certificates in a process called &lt;strong&gt;certificate path validation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-cert-path-validation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Certificate Path Validation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6&quot;&gt;certificate path validation&lt;/a&gt; algorithm is complicated. It includes checking certificate expirations, revocation status, various certificate policies, key use restrictions, and a bunch of other stuff. Proper implementation of this algorithm by PKI RPs is absolutely critical. People are shockingly casual about disabling certificate path validation (e.g., by passing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-k&lt;/code&gt; flag to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;). Don’t do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t disable certificate path validation.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not that hard to do proper TLS, and certificate path validation is the part of TLS that does authentication. People sometimes argue that the channel is still encrypted, so it doesn’t matter. That’s wrong. It does matter. Encryption without authentication is pretty worthless. It’s like a blind confessional: your conversation is private but you have no idea who’s on the other side of the curtain. Only this isn’t a church, it’s the internet. So &lt;strong&gt;don’t disable certificate path validation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;key--certificate-lifecycle&quot;&gt;Key &amp;amp; Certificate Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can use a certificate with a protocol like TLS you need to figure out how to get one from a CA. Abstractly this is a pretty simple process: a subscriber that wants a certificate generates a key pair and submits a request to a certificate authority. The CA makes sure the name that will be bound in the certificate is correct and, if it is, signs and returns a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates expire, at which point they’re no longer trusted by RPs. If you’re still using a certificate that’s about to expire you’ll need to renew and rotate it. If you want RPs to stop trusting a certificate before it expires, it can (sometimes) be revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like much of PKI this simple process is deceptively intricate. Hidden in the details are the two hardest problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things. Still, it’s all easy enough to reason about once you understand what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;naming-things&quot;&gt;Naming things&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, X.509 used X.500 &lt;em&gt;distinguished names&lt;/em&gt; (DNs) to name the subject of a certificate (a subscriber). A DN includes a &lt;em&gt;common name&lt;/em&gt; (for me, that’d be “Mike Malone”). It can also include a &lt;em&gt;locality&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;country&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;organization&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;organizational unit&lt;/em&gt;, and a whole bunch of other irrelevant crap (recall that this stuff was originally meant for a digital phone book). No one understands distinguished names. They don’t really make sense for the web. Avoid them. If you do use them, keep them simple. You don’t have to use every field. In fact, you &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt;. A common name is probably all you need, and perhaps an organization name if you’re a thrill seeker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKIX originally specified that the DNS hostname of a website should be bound in the the DN &lt;em&gt;common name&lt;/em&gt;. More recently, the CAB Forum has deprecated this practice and made the entire DN optional (see sections 7.1.4.2 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-BR-1.6.1.pdf&quot;&gt;Baseline Requirements&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, the modern best practices is to leverage the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6&quot;&gt;subject alternative name (SAN) X.509 extension&lt;/a&gt; to bind a name in a certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four sorts of SANs in common use, all of which bind names that are broadly used and understood: domain names (DNS), email addresses, IP addresses, and URIs. These are already supposed to be unique in the contexts we’re interested in, and they map pretty well to the things we’re interested in identifying: email addresses for people, domain names and IP addresses for machines and code, URIs if you want to get fancy. Use SANs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-inspect-san-dns.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Step Certificate Inspect SAN vs DN&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that Web PKI allows for multiple names to be bound in a certificate and allows for wildcards in names. A certificate can have multiple SANs, and can have SANs like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*.smallstep.com&lt;/code&gt;. This is useful for websites that respond to multiple names (e.g., &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smallstep.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www.smallstep.com&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;generating-key-pairs&quot;&gt;Generating key pairs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve got a name we need to generate a key pair before we can create a certificate. Recall that the security of a PKI depends critically on a simple invariant: that the only entity that knows a given private key is the subscriber named in the corresponding certificate. To be sure that this invariant holds, best practice is to have the subscriber generate its own key pair so it’s the only thing that &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; knows it. Definitely avoid transmitting a private key across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to decide what type of key you want to use. That’s another post entirely, but here’s some quick guidance (as of December 2018). There’s a slow but ongoing transition from RSA to elliptic curve keys (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/&quot;&gt;ECDSA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032&quot;&gt;EdDSA&lt;/a&gt;). If you decide to use RSA keys make them at least 2048 bits, and don’t bother with anything bigger than 4096 bits. If you use ECDSA, the P-256 curve is probably best (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;secp256k1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prime256v1&lt;/code&gt; in openssl)… unless you’re worried about the NSA in which case you may opt to use something fancier like EdDSA with Curve25519 (though support for these keys is not great).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of generating a elliptic curve P-256 key pair using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -out k.prv
openssl ec -in es256.key -pubout -out k.pub
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of generating the same sort of key pair using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;step&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;step crypto keypair --kty EC --curve P-256 k.pub k.prv
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also do this programmatically and never let your private keys touch disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose your poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;issuance&quot;&gt;Issuance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a subscriber has a name and key pair the next step is to obtain a leaf certificate from a CA. The CA is going to want to authenticate (prove) two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The public key to be bound in the certificate is the subscriber’s public key (i.e., the subscriber knows the corresponding private key)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The name to be bound in the certificate is the subscriber’s name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former is typically achieved via a simple technical mechanism: a certificate signing request. The latter is harder. Abstractly, the process is called identity proofing or registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;certificate-signing-requests&quot;&gt;Certificate signing requests&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To request a certificate a subscriber submits a &lt;em&gt;certificate signing request&lt;/em&gt; (CSR) to a certificate authority. The CSR is another ASN.1 structure, defined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2986&quot;&gt;PKCS#10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a certificate, a CSR is a data structure that contains a public key, a name, and a signature. It’s self-signed using the private key that corresponds to the public key in the CSR. This signature proves that whatever created the CSR knows the private key. It also allows the CSR to be copy-pasted and shunted around without the possibility of modification by some interloper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSRs include lots of options for specifying certificate details. In practice most of this stuff is ignored by CAs. Instead most CAs use a template or provide an administrative interface to collect this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can generate a key pair and create a CSR using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;step&lt;/code&gt; in one command like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;step certificate create –csr test.smallstep.com test.csr test.key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL is super powerful, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-req.html&quot;&gt;a lot more annoying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;identity-proofing&quot;&gt;Identity proofing&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a CA receives a CSR and verifies its signature the next thing it needs to do is figure out whether the name to be bound in the certificate is actually the correct name of the subscriber. This is tricky. The whole point of certificates is to allow RPs to authenticate subscribers, but how is the CA supposed to authenticate the subscriber before a certificate’s been issued?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is: it depends. For Web PKI there are three kinds of certificates and the biggest differences are how they identify subscribers and the sort of identity proofing that’s employed. They are: domain validation (DV), organization validation (OV), and extended validation (EV) certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DV certificates bind a DNS name and are issued based on proof of control over a domain name. Proofing typically proceeds via a simple ceremony like sending a confirmation email to the administrative contact listed in WHOIS records. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/draft-ietf-acme-acme.html&quot;&gt;ACME protocol&lt;/a&gt;, originally developed and used by Let’s Encrypt, improves this process with better automation: instead of using email verification an ACME CA issues a challenge that the subscriber must complete to prove it controls a domain. The challenge portion of the ACME specification is an extension point, but common challenges include serving a random number at a given URL (the HTTP challenge) and placing a random number in a DNS TXT record (the DNS challenge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OV and EV certificates build on DV certificates and include the name and location of the organization that owns the bound domain name. They connect a certificate not just to a domain name, but to the legal entity that controls it. The verification process for OV certificates is not consistent across CAs. To address this, CAB Forum introduced EV certificates. They include the same basic information but mandate strict verification (identity proofing) requirements. The EV process can take days or weeks and can include public records searches and attestations (on paper) signed by corporate officers (with pens). After all this, when you visit a website that uses an EV certificate some browsers display the name of the organization in the URL bar. Outside this limited use in browsers, EV certificates aren’t widely leveraged or required by Web PKI relying parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-github-ev.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Github EV&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially every Web PKI RP only requires DV level assurance, based on “proof” of control of a domain. It’s important to consider what, precisely, a DV certificate &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; proves. It’s &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to prove that the entity requesting the certificate owns the relevant domain. It &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; proves that, at some point in time, the entity requesting the certificate was able to read an email &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; configure DNS &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; serve a secret via HTTP. The underlying security of DNS, email, and BGP that these processes rely on is not great. Attacks against this infrastructure &lt;a href=&quot;https://doublepulsar.com/hijack-of-amazons-internet-domain-service-used-to-reroute-web-traffic-for-two-hours-unnoticed-3a6f0dda6a6f&quot;&gt;have occurred&lt;/a&gt; with the intent to obtain fraudulent certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For internal PKI you can use any process you want for identity proofing. You can probably do better than relying on DNS or email the way Web PKI does. This might seem hard at first, but it’s really not. You can leverage existing trusted infrastructure: whatever you use to provision your stuff should also be able to measure and attest to the identity of whatever’s being provisioned. If you trust Chef or Puppet or Ansible or Kubernetes to put code on servers, you can trust them for identity attestations. If you’re using raw AMIs on AWS you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html&quot;&gt;instance identity documents&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/verifying-instance-identity&quot;&gt;GCP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt; have similar functionality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your provisioning infrastructure &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have some notion of identity in order to put the right code in the right place and start things up. And you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; trust it. You can leverage this knowledge and trust to configure RP trust stores and bootstrap subscribers into your internal PKI. All you need to do is come up with some way for your provisioning infrastructure to tell your CA the identity of whatever’s starting up. Incidentally, this is precisely the gap &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallstep.com/certificates/&quot;&gt;step certificates&lt;/a&gt; was designed to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;expiration&quot;&gt;Expiration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates expire… usually. This isn’t a strict requirement, per se, but it’s almost always true. Including an expiration in a certificate is important because certificate use is disaggregated: in general there’s no central authority that’s interrogated when a certificate is verified by an RP. Without an expiration date, certificates would be trusted forever. A rule of thumb for security is that, as we approach forever, the probability of a credential becoming compromised approaches 100%. Thus, certificates expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, X.509 certificates include a validity period: an &lt;em&gt;issued at&lt;/em&gt; time, a &lt;em&gt;not before&lt;/em&gt; time, and a &lt;em&gt;not after&lt;/em&gt; time. Time marches forward, eventually passes the &lt;em&gt;not after&lt;/em&gt; time, and the certificate dies. This seemingly innocuous inevitability has a couple important subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there’s nothing stopping a particular RP from accepting an expired certificate by mistake (or bad design). Again, certificate use is disaggregated. It’s up to each RP to check whether a certificate has expired, and sometimes they mess up. This might happen if your code depends on a system clock that isn’t properly synchronized. A common scenario is a system whose clock is reset to the unix epoch that doesn’t trust any certificates because it thinks it’s January 1, 1970 — well before the &lt;em&gt;not before&lt;/em&gt; time on any recently issued certificate. So make sure your clocks are synchronized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subscriber side, private key material needs to be dealt with properly after certificate expiration. If a key pair was used for signing/authentication (e.g., with TLS) you’ll want to delete the private key once it’s no longer needed. Keeping a signing key around is an unnecessary security risk: it’s no good for anything but fraudulent signatures. However, if your key pair was used for encryption the situation is different. You’ll need to keep the private key around as long as there’s still data encrypted under the key. If you’ve ever been told not to use the same key pair for signing and encryption, this is the main reason. Using the same key for signing and encryption makes it impossible to implement key lifecycle management best practices when a private key is no longer needed for signing: it forces you to keep signing keys around longer than necessary if it’s still needed to decrypt stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewal&quot;&gt;Renewal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still using a certificate that’s about to expire you’re going to want to renew it before that happens. There’s actually no standard renewal process for Web PKI – there’s no formal way to extend the validity period on a certificate. Instead you just replace the expiring certificate with a new one. So the renewal process is the same as the issuance process: generate and submit a CSR and fulfill any identity proofing obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For internal PKI we can do better. The easiest thing to do is to use your old certificate with a protocol like mutual TLS to renew. The CA can authenticate the client certificate presented by the subscriber, re-sign it with an extended expiry, and return the new certificate in response. This makes automated renewal very easy and still forces subscribers to periodically check in with a central authority. You can use this checkin process to easily build monitoring and revocation facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case the hardest part is simply remembering to renew your certificates before they expire. Pretty much everyone who manages certificates for a public website has had one expire unexpectedly, producing an error &lt;a href=&quot;https://expired.badssl.com/&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. My best advice here is: if something hurts, do it more. Use short lived certificates. That will force you to improve your processes and automate this problem away. Let’s Encrypt makes automation easy and issues 90 day certificates, which is pretty good for Web PKI. For internal PKI you should probably go even shorter: twenty-four hours or less. There are some implementation challenges – &lt;a href=&quot;https://diogomonica.com/2017/01/11/hitless-tls-certificate-rotation-in-go/&quot;&gt;hitless certificate rotation&lt;/a&gt; can be a bit tricky – but it’s worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick tip, you can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;step&lt;/code&gt; to check the expiry time on a certificate from the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;step certificate inspect cert.pem --format json | jq .validity.end
step certificate inspect https://smallstep.com --format json | jq .validity.end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little thing, but if you combine this with a DNS zone transfer in a little bash script you can get decent monitoring around certificate expiration for all your domains to help catch issues before they become outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;revocation&quot;&gt;Revocation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a private key is compromised or a certificate’s simply no longer needed you might want to revoke it. That is, you might want to actively mark it as invalid so that it stops being trusted by RPs immediately, even before it expires. Revoking X.509 certificates is &lt;a href=&quot;https://maikel.pro/blog/current-state-certificate-revocation-crls-ocsp/&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/revocation-is-broken/&quot;&gt;big&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/04/19/revchecking.html&quot;&gt;mess&lt;/a&gt;. Like expiration, the onus is on RPs to enforce revocations. Unlike expiration, the revocation status can’t be encoded in the certificate. The RP has to determine the certificate’s revocation status via some out-of-band process. Unless explicitly configured, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=745837&quot;&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18323&quot;&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38301283/java-ssl-certificate-revocation-checking&quot;&gt;PKI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39297240/python-failed-to-verify-any-crls-for-ssl-tls-connections?rq=1&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16244084/how-to-programmatically-check-if-a-certificate-has-been-revoked&quot;&gt;RPs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/16338&quot;&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/24298&quot;&gt;bother&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, by default, most TLS implementations will happily accept revoked certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For internal PKI the trend is towards accepting this reality and using &lt;em&gt;passive revocation&lt;/em&gt;. That is, issuing certificates that expire quickly enough that revocation isn’t necessary. If you want to “revoke” a certificate you simply disallow renewal and wait for it to expire. For this to work you need to use short-lived certificates. How short? That depends on your threat model (that’s how security professionals say ¯\&lt;em&gt;(ツ)&lt;/em&gt;/¯). Twenty-four hours is pretty typical, but so are much shorter expirations like five minutes. There are obvious challenges around scalability and availability if you push lifetimes too short: every renewal requires interaction with an online CA, so your CA infrastructure better be scalable and highly available. As you decrease certificate lifetime, remember to keep all your clocks in sync or you’re gonna have a bad time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the web and other scenarios where passive revocation won’t work, the first thing you should do is stop and reconsider passive revocation. If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; must have revocation you have two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Certificate Signing Protocol (OCSP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRLs are defined along with a million other things in RFC 5280. They’re simply a signed list of serial numbers identifying revoked certificates. The list is served from a &lt;em&gt;CRL distribution point&lt;/em&gt;: a URL that’s included in the certificate. The expectation is that relying parties will download this list and interrogate it for revocation status whenever they verify a certificate. There are some obvious problems here: CRLs can be big, and distribution points can go down. If RPs check CRLs at all they’ll heavily cache the response from the distribution point and only sync periodically. On the web CRLs are often cached for days. If it’s going to take that long for CRLs to propagate you might as well just use passive revocation. It’s also common for RPs to &lt;em&gt;fail open&lt;/em&gt; – to accept a certificate if the the CRL distribution point is down. This can be a security issue: you can trick an RP into accepting a revoked certificate by mounting a denial of service attack against the CRL distribution point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, even if you’re using CRLs you should consider using short-lived certificates to keep CRL size down. The CRL only needs to include serial numbers for certificates that are revoked &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; haven’t yet expired. If your certs have shorter lifetimes, your CRLs will be shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like CRL your other option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2560.txt&quot;&gt;OCSP&lt;/a&gt;, which allows RPs to query an &lt;em&gt;OCSP responder&lt;/em&gt; with a certificate serial number to obtain the revocation status of a particular certificate. Like the CRL distribution point, the OCSP responder URL is included in the certificate. OCSP sounds sweet (and obvious), but it has its own problems. It raises serious privacy issues for Web PKI: the OCSP responder can see what sites I’m visiting based on the certificate status checks I’ve submitted. It also adds overhead to every TLS connection: an additional request has to be made to check revocation status. Like CRL, many RPs (including browsers) fail open and assume a certificate is valid if the OCSP responder is down or returns an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCSP stapling is a variant of OCSP that’s supposed to fix these issues. Instead of the relying party hitting the OCSP responder the subscriber that owns the certificate does. The OCSP response is a signed attestation with a short expiry stating that the certificate is not revoked. The attestation is included in the TLS handshake (“stapled to” the certificate) between subscriber and RP. This provides the RP with a reasonably up-to-date revocation status without having to query the OCSP responder directly. The subscriber can use a signed OCSP response multiple times, until it expires. This reduces the load on the responder, mostly eliminates performance problems, and addresses the privacy issue with OCSP. However, all of this is a bit of a rube goldberg device. If subscribers are hitting some authority to obtain a short-lived signed attestation saying that a certificate hasn’t expired why not cut out the middleman: just use short-lived certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-certificates&quot;&gt;Using certificates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this background out of the way, actually &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; certificates is really easy. We’ll demonstrate with TLS, but most other uses are pretty similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To configure a PKI relying party you tell it which root certificates to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To configure a PKI subscriber you tell it which certificate and private key to use (or tell it how to generate its own key pair and exchange a CSR for a certificate itself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty common for one entity (code, device, server, etc) to be both an RP and a subscriber. Such entities will need to be configured with the root certificate(s) and a certificate and private key. Finally, for Web PKI the right root certificates are generally trusted by default, so you can skip that part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a complete example demonstrating certificate issuance, root certificate distribution, and TLS client (RP) and server (subscriber) configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://smallstep.com/images/blog/2018-12-11-step-ca-certificate-flow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;step ca certificate Flow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this illustrates how straightforward right and proper internal PKI and TLS can be. You don’t need to use self-signed certificates or do dangerous things like disabling certificate path validation (passing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-k&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every TLS client and server takes these same parameters. Almost all of them punt on the key and certificate lifecycle bit: they generally assume certificates magically appear on disk, are rotated, etc. That’s the hard part. Again, if you need that, that’s what step certificates does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography lets computers “see” across networks. If I have a public key, I can “see” you have the corresponding private key, but I can’t use it myself. If I don’t have your public key, certificates can help. Certificates bind public keys to the name of the owner of the corresponding private key. They’re like driver’s licenses for computers and code. Certificate authorities (CAs) sign certificates with their private keys, vouching for these bindings. They’re like the DMV. If you’re the only one who looks like you, and you show me a driver’s license from a DMV I trust, I can figure out your name. If you’re the only one who knows a private key, and you send me a certificate from a CA I trust, I can figure out your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world most certificates are X.509 v3 certificates. They’re defined using ASN.1 and usually serialized as PEM-encoded DER. The corresponding private keys are usually represented as PKCS#8 objects, also serialized as PEM-encoded DER. If you use Java or Microsoft you might run into PKCS#7 and PKCS#12 envelope formats. There’s a lot of historical baggage here that can make this stuff pretty frustrating to work with, but it’s more annoying than it is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public key infrastructure is the umbrella term for all the stuff you need to build and agree on in order to use public keys effectively: names, key types, certificates, CAs, cron jobs, libraries, etc. Web PKI is the public PKI that’s used by default by web browsers and pretty much everything else that uses TLS. Web PKI CAs are trusted but not trustworthy. Internal PKI is your own PKI that you build and run yourself. You want one because Web PKI wasn’t designed for internal use cases, and because internal PKI is easier to automate, easier to scale, and gives you more control over a lot of important stuff like naming and certificate lifetime. Use Web PKI for public stuff. Use your own internal PKI for internal stuff (e.g., to &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallstep.com/blog/use-tls.html&quot;&gt;use TLS&lt;/a&gt; to replace VPNs). &lt;span class=&quot;widget&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;github-button&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/smallstep/certificates&quot; data-icon=&quot;octicon-star&quot; aria-label=&quot;Star smallstep/certificates on GitHub&quot;&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smallstep/certificates&quot;&gt;smallstep/certificates&lt;/a&gt; makes building an internal PKI pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a certificate you need to name stuff and generate keys. Use SANs for names: DNS SANs for code and machines, EMAIL SANs for people. Use URI SANs if these won’t work. Key type is a big topic that’s mostly unimportant: you can change key types and the actual crypto won’t be the weakest link in your PKI. To get a certificate from a CA you submit a CSR and prove your identity. Use short-lived certificates and passive revocation. Automate certificate renewal. Don’t disable certificate path validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: certificates and PKI bind names to public keys. The rest is just details.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask</og:title>
<og:description>Certificates and public key infrastructure (PKI) are hard. No shit, right? I know a lot of smart people who've avoided this particular rabbit hole. Personally, I avoided it for a long time and felt some shame for not knowing more. The obvious result was a vicious cycle: I was too embarrassed to ask questions so I never learned. Eventually I was forced to learn this stuff because of what it enables: PKI lets you define a system cryptographically. It's universal and vendor neutral. It works everywhere so bits of your system can run anywhere and communicate securely. It's conceptually simple and super flexible. It lets you use TLS and ditch VPNs. You can ignore everything about your network and still have strong security characteristics. It's pretty great.</og:description>
