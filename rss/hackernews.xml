<title>Re-Licensing Sentry</title>
<link>https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/3c2e87&quot;&gt;a small piece of code&lt;/a&gt; that would eventually be called Sentry was born. When I wrote this code, I didn’t know much about open-source, so when it came down to licensing, I just grabbed the first reasonable suggestion thrown my way. That suggestion happened to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause&quot;&gt;BSD 3-Clause License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and a lot has changed. Sentry is far more than that original 70-line snippet; it’s a complex product made up of millions of lines of code that is used by tens of thousands of businesses around the world. It’s also no longer a personal project; it now employs nearly 100 individuals who depend on it for their livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentry – both the project and the company – is large enough now to question whether the licensing decision made 11 years ago was the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, we had been talking about re-licensing Sentry. Primarily, we wanted to standardize on an open-source license across all of our projects. These would replace our existing diverse use of Apache-2.0, MIT, and BSD 3-Clause across our hundreds of repositories, and ensure Sentry developers didn’t need to make licensing decisions on future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, our thinking was to standardize on Apache-2.0, which is a well-understood and widely adopted free, open-source license. But before rushing into another licensing decision, we stepped back and wrote down the few goals we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone should be able to run Sentry for themselves or their business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No difference between our cloud service and our open-source product (no open-core model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal limitations on usage of code; as free as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protection from other companies selling our work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last bullet point – &lt;em&gt;protection from other companies selling our work&lt;/em&gt; – was something we hadn’t given a lot of weight to before. But several well-timed events had occurred that caused us to re-evaluate how important this was to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;commercializing-open-source&quot;&gt; Commercializing Open-Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pride ourselves on delivering a unified, free, open-source service, where our cloud offering (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sentry.io&quot;&gt;sentry.io&lt;/a&gt;) has the same functionality as our open-source offering. This stands in contrast to other open-source companies, who offer a reduced “open core” feature set that moves critical features into a paid, closed-source version of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentry is often compared with companies that operate this way, but I will be the first to stand up at the front of the room to illustrate how these models are not equal. That said, as we’ve grown, we’ve felt the pain of a purely permissive license, and better understand why companies pursue the open core model or other alternative licensing arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this past year, we’ve had to deal with funded businesses plagiarizing or copying our work to directly compete with Sentry. This has included taking marketing content from our website, plagiarizing our documentation and framing it as their own, or straight-up copy/pasting our product visuals. Their defense? “Well, it’s &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; open-source, and we can do that.” These businesses are not using Sentry to improve how they develop software; they’re lifting its code and assets to build their closed-source products to compete directly with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far,&lt;/em&gt; this has been less serious than some of the concerns other open-source companies have. In the last few years, the big cloud providers have provided commercial hosted offerings of popular open-source projects. Offerings that compete with those companies’ own hosted solutions. We’ve been fortunate in that the big cloud providers have not &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; tried to monetize Sentry in this way, but this distinct possibility remains an existential threat to our business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that Sentry “the project” has been developed almost exclusively by employees of Sentry “the company”; millions of dollars have paid the salaries of engineers, designers, and product people to produce the software we know and love today. We face a catch-22 problem: if we continue to use a fully permissive license, we face real competitive elements that threaten the future of Sentry and our ability to continue funding its development. But if we move to an “open core” model that better protects our IP, users won’t be able to freely modify and deploy Sentry – all of it – as they can today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we need a licensing arrangement that satisfies our need to protect our business while allowing us to develop and distribute our source code in as open a fashion as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-the-business-source-license-bsl&quot;&gt; Enter The Business Source License (BSL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, several companies have experimented with alternative licensing arrangements to protect against these concerns. In June, we saw our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/&quot;&gt;Cockroach Labs&lt;/a&gt; (the creators of CockroachDB) moving to a new protections-focused license known as the “Business Source License” (or BSL). This license seemed like it would fit well with Sentry’s goals, so we started digging deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSL is a standardized license with two distinct components: a license grant restriction and a conversion date whereby the license “converts” to a more permissive license (without a license grant restriction). In Sentry’s case, we’ve adapted these components to mean the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You cannot offer a commercial version of Sentry’s service (the license grant restriction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 36 months, the code becomes Apache-2.0 licensed (the conversion period)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we’ve come to refer to the BSL as &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; open-source since it &lt;em&gt;converts&lt;/em&gt; to an OSI-approved license at the conversion date, due to the grant restriction, it is formally &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an open-source license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSL lets us hit our goals in a clean and low-impact way: &lt;strong&gt;it won’t change anyone’s ability to run Sentry at their company&lt;/strong&gt;, but it will ensure that we are protected from our work being used in an anti-competitive fashion. Most importantly, it guarantees that Sentry’s source will live on, and after three years, it can be used just as it is today, with attribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-open-source&quot;&gt; The Future of Open-Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re literally entering a new decade, and like some of our contemporaries, we believe changes need to be made in the business of open-source software. Previous licensing models – the “open core” model, GPL, and permissive licenses like BSD and Apache-2.0 – are not sufficient for the way OSS is distributed and used today. We want to explore an alternative approach, one that allows for easy adoption and open distribution of our software, but defends against competitors repackaging our work in a way that threatens Sentry’s ongoing development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a brave new world, but we believe this licensing change will best ensure the future of Sentry and that protections-oriented source-available licenses like the BSL will become increasingly common as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;questions--we-have-answers&quot;&gt; Questions – we have answers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in understanding more about how this licensing change affects Sentry, we have prepared an &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.sentry.io/t/re-licensing-sentry-faq-discussion/8044&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that goes into more detail. We’d also like to have an open dialogue with our users and customers – please consider commenting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.sentry.io/t/re-licensing-sentry-faq-discussion/8044&quot;&gt;our forums&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re happy to answer any additional questions or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

Google was a hip, young tech company that made money – actual money! – off the internet. Karmazin was there to find out how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, Google’s founder and its CEO respectively, were already seated in the conference room when co-founder Sergey Brin came in, out of breath. He was wearing shorts. And roller skates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google guys told Karmazin that the search engine’s earnings came from selling advertisements. Companies could buy paid links to websites that would appear at the top of users’ search results. And Google worked as a middleman, connecting websites with ad space to advertisers eager to get their banners seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schmidt continued: &quot;Our business is highly measurable. We know that if you spend X dollars on ads, you’ll get Y dollars in revenues.&quot; At Google, Schmidt maintained, you pay only for what works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karmazin was horrified. He was an old fashioned advertising man, and where he came from, a Super Bowl ad cost three million dollars. Why? Because that’s how much it cost. What does it yield? Who knows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m selling $25bn of advertising a year,&quot; Karmazin said. &quot;Why would I want anyone to know what works and what doesn’t?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaning on the table, hands folded, he gazed at his hosts and told them: &quot;You’re fucking with the magic.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Google hacking your brain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than a century, advertising was an art, not a science. Hard data didn’t exist. An advertising guru of the &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;Donald Draper is a fictional character and protagonist on the television series Mad Men. In the series Draper is the creative director of Manhattan advertising firm Sterling Cooper.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__image&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/image/wWnJvqBYLGc6h7v0-SyoOFSxVPE=/320x213/tc-useruploads-images/c31a0a7a4a814fceb818ad4e87299da9.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Donald Draper is a fictional character and protagonist on the television series Mad Men. In the series Draper is the creative director of Manhattan advertising firm Sterling Cooper. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-46c72215-9449-470d-9499-ded887fa2d48&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;Don Draper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-46c72215-9449-470d-9499-ded887fa2d48&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; type proclaimed: &quot;What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;Nylons are tights&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Nylons are tights &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-46654828-6920-47d1-9789-5306f84d7c7e&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;nylons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-46654828-6920-47d1-9789-5306f84d7c7e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” – and advertisers could only hope it was true. You put your commercials on the air, you put your brand in the paper, and you started praying. Would anyone see the ad? Would anyone act on it? Nobody knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, the internet sounded the death knell for that era of advertising. Today, we no longer live in the age of Mad Men, but of Math Men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for customers, clicks, conversions? Google and Facebook know where to find them. With unprecedented precision, these data giants will get the right message delivered to the right people at the right time. Unassuming internet users are lured into online shops, undecided voters are informed about the evils of US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, and cars zip by on the screens of potential buyers – a test drive is only a click away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is any of it real? What do we really know about the effectiveness of digital advertising? Are advertising platforms any good at manipulating us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be forgiven for thinking the answer to that last question is: yes, extremely good. After all, the market is huge. The amount of money spent on internet ads goes up each year. In 2018, more than $273bn dollars was spent on digital ads globally, according to research firm eMarketer. Most of those ads were purchased from two companies: Google ($116bn in 2018) and Facebook ($54.5bn in 2018).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newspapers are teeming with treatises about these tech giants’ saturnine activities. &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;See Harari, Yuval Noah. &amp;quot;Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will.&amp;quot; Financial Times 26.08 (2016).&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__source&amp;quot;&amp;gt; See &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.ft.com/content/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Harari, Yuval Noah. &amp;amp;quot;Yuval Noah Harari on big data, Google and the end of free will.&amp;amp;quot; Financial Times 26.08 (2016).&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-97efa67d-f3e5-4216-85fb-d54da507cbf0&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;An essay by best-selling author Yuval Noah Harari on &quot;the end of free will&quot; exemplifies the genre:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon mod-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-infocard-source&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-97efa67d-f3e5-4216-85fb-d54da507cbf0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; according to the Israeli thinker, it’s only a matter of time before big data systems “understand humans much better than we understand ourselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Cunning marketers can predict and manipulate our behaviour. Facebook knows your soul. Google is hacking your brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘The best minds of our generation’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too used to believe that these tech giants were all-knowing entities. But while writing this story, I have come to realise that this belief is as wrong as it is popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Facebook engineer once said (and he’s been quoted a thousand times over): &quot;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click on ads.&quot; I spoke to some of those best minds: economists employed and formerly employed by the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley: Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft, eBay, Facebook, Netflix, Pandora and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story is about organisations and why they are so hard to change. And it’s about us, and how easy we are to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They weren’t always easy to get a hold of. I’d send an email in late October, and perhaps they would have an hour in January, at some ungodly hour in Europe. And then there was the language barrier. These guys did not speak English, but fluent &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;Jargon typically used in the field of economics.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Jargon typically used in the field of economics. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-cd61ffbd-46fd-4213-9631-f9d243abdaa7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;Economese&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-cd61ffbd-46fd-4213-9631-f9d243abdaa7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . My Economese is not all bad, but two hours of Hausman tests, incremental bidding, and exogenous variation is too much, even for an enthusiast such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, mixed in with the jargon, there were enough anecdotes to make your head spin. They would utter one line in plain English that I’d end up mulling over the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story that emerged from these conversations is about much more than just online advertising. It’s about a market of a quarter of a trillion dollars governed by irrationality. It’s about knowables, about how even the biggest data sets don’t always provide insight. It’s about organisations and why they are so hard to change. And it’s about us, and how easy we are to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing was gradually becoming clear to me: these guys are fucking with the magic. And nobody knows it. Or as Garrett Johnson, who used to work for Yahoo!, told me: &quot;I don’t have anybody pounding down my door telling me I’m fucking with their magic, because … well, they don’t even know who I am.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/f679a540745548a28b5d1ddc5d8e3a7d.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Tadelis was the most accessible of the bunch. He instantly replied to my email: &quot;I would be delighted to talk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadelis told me about his work for eBay, a broad grin lining his face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with a surrealistic phone call to a data consultant. Tadelis was a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley when he went and spent a year at eBay in August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of his first conversations with eBay’s marketing team, they invited him to sit down with their consultants. The consultants could tell him how profitable each of eBay’s ad campaigns had been. And since Tadelis was an economist, maybe he’d like to quiz them about their methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Proprietary transformation functions,&quot; one of the consultants had said on the phone when Tadelis reached out. They used proprietary transformation functions, had 25 years of experience, and a long list of prominent clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tadelis pressed them he realised that “proprietary transformation functions” was only a clever disguise for your garden-variety statistics. You take the weekly expenditure on ads, combine it with the weekly sales, and voila! Fold the mixture into a scatter plot and see what happens. &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;This is very simply put indeed. Data analysts also correct for other factors that influence sales, such as holidays, the current state of the economy, the weather and so on.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; This is very simply put indeed. Data analysts also correct for other factors that influence sales, such as holidays, the current state of the economy, the weather and so on. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-cb18a16a-3910-4205-bd71-b30aa78217e8&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;Easy as that!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-cb18a16a-3910-4205-bd71-b30aa78217e8&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graph showing the change in exposure to ads, and the change in sales. There seems to be a correlation.&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/271b03f46f0f4f30b1604fdcc4f17032.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is garbage,&quot; Tadelis thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation, as any Statistics 101 class will inform you, is not causation. What do these impressive numbers mean if the people who see your ad are the exact same people who were going to use eBay anyway? eBay is no small fry. Surely lots of people looking for shoes end up on the online auction site all by themselves, whether they see an ad or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this. Luigi’s Pizzeria hires three teenagers to hand out coupons to passersby. After a few weeks of flyering, one of the three turns out to be a marketing genius. Customers keep showing up with coupons distributed by this particular kid. The other two can’t make any sense of it: how does he do it? When they ask him, he explains: &quot;I stand in the waiting area of the pizzeria.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s plain to see that junior’s no marketing whiz. Pizzerias do not attract more customers by giving coupons to people already planning to order a quattro stagioni five minutes from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Streamer&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can get my head around a cynical advertising world, but a naive one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists refer to this as a &quot;selection effect.&quot; It is crucial for advertisers to distinguish such a selection effect (people see your ad, but were already going to click, buy, register, or download) from the advertising effect (people see your ad, and that’s why they start clicking, buying, registering, downloading). Tadelis asked how exactly the consultants made this distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We use Lagrange multipliers,&quot; one of them said. And for a second, Tadelis was astounded. What? Lagrange multipliers? But Lagrange multipliers don’t have anything to do with ...&quot;Then it hit me,&quot; Tadelis recalled. &quot;This guy is trying to out-jargon me!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I resisted the temptation to say: ‘I’m sorry, you’re fucked, I actually teach this stuff.’&quot; Instead, Tadelis decided to continue the conversation in Economese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lagrange multipliers, that’s fascinating,&quot; he replied. &quot;So now I know you have a constrained optimisation model, and as we all know the Lagrange multipliers are the shadow values of the constraints in the objective function. We all know this, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line went silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what is your objective function, and what are your constraints?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Steve, are you on a cell phone? Because you’re breaking up and I can’t hear you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A not-so-brilliant advertising campaign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, Tadelis met the marketing consultants in the flesh. The advisers had put together a slick presentation demonstrating how eBay was raking in piles of cash with its brilliant ad campaigns. Tadelis recalled: &quot;I looked around the room, and all I saw were people nodding their heads.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brand keyword advertising, the presentation informed him, was eBay’s most successful advertising method. Somebody googles &quot;eBay&quot; and for a fee, Google places a link to eBay at the top of the search results. Lots of people, apparently, click on this paid link. So many people, according to the consultants, that the auction website earns at least $12.28 for every dollar it spends on brand keyword advertising – a hefty profit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadelis didn’t buy it. &quot;I thought it was fantastic, and I don’t mean extraordinarily good or attractive. I mean imaginative, fanciful, remote from reality.&quot; His rationale? People really do click on the paid-link to eBay.com an awful lot. But if that link weren’t there, presumably they would click on the link just below it: the free link to eBay.com. The data consultants were basing their profit calculations on clicks they would be getting anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadelis suggested an experiment: stop advertising for a while, and let’s see whether brand keyword advertising really works. The consultants grumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, a few weeks later, Tadelis contacted the consultants about a follow-up meeting, he was told the follow-up had come and gone. He hadn’t been invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after the awkward presentation, though, Tadelis got the chance to conduct his experiment after all. There was a clash going on between the marketing department at eBay and the MSN network (Bing and Yahoo!). Ebay wanted to negotiate lower prices, and to get leverage decided to stop ads for the keyword ‘eBay’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadelis got right down to business. Together with his team, he carefully analysed the effects of the ad stop. Three months later, the results were clear: all the traffic that had previously come from paid links was now coming in through ordinary links. Tadelis had been right all along. Annually, eBay was burning a good $20m on ads targeting the keyword ‘eBay’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graph showing the decline in visitors from the moment the ads stop. It shows that there is a decline in visitors via the paid link, but an increase just as big via an unpaid link.&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/5ed7d0cd14e94bf9b8f8795468f57130.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tadelis presented his findings to the company, eBay’s financial department finally woke up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economist was given a free hand: he was permitted to halt all of eBay’s ads on Google for three months throughout a third of the United States. Not just those for the brand’s own name, but also those targeted to match simple keywords like &quot;shoes&quot;, &quot;shirts&quot; and &quot;glassware&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing department anticipated a disaster: sales, they thought, were certain to drop at least 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 1: All quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 2: Still quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 3: Zip, zero, zilch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment continued for another eight weeks. What was the effect of pulling the ads? Almost none. For every dollar eBay spent on search advertising, they &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;The 95% confidence interval is between negative $0.03 and negative $1.24.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;Tadelis and his co-authors eventually published a paper on the experiment in a prominent economics journals.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Tadelis and his co-authors eventually published a paper on the experiment in a prominent economics journals. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__source&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w20171.pdf&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Blake, Thomas, Chris Nosko, and Steven Tadelis. &amp;amp;quot;Consumer heterogeneity and paid search effectiveness: A large‐scale field experiment.&amp;amp;quot; Econometrica 83.1 (2015): 155-174. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-7a6b39a6-81ef-46da-936c-b9340cddb5cb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;The experiment ended up showing that, for years, eBay had been spending millions of dollars on fruitless online advertising excess, and that the joke had been entirely on the company.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-7a6b39a6-81ef-46da-936c-b9340cddb5cb&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the marketing department everything had been going brilliantly. The high-paid consultants had believed that the campaigns that incurred the biggest losses were the most profitable: they saw brand keyword advertising not as a $20m expense, but a $245.6m return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Tadelis, it was an eye-opener. &quot;I kind of had the belief that most economists have: businesses are advertising, so it must be good. Because otherwise why would they do it?&quot; He added: &quot;But after my experience at eBay that’s all out of the window.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/69ae204f2648470b9df860db086a24d8.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt just as surprised as Tadelis had been. I can get my head around a cynical advertising world, but a naive one? But the more I talked to these economists, the more I realised that eBay was not alone in making this mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Randall Lewis, who used to work for Yahoo!, Google and Netflix, and is currently head of research for the ad platform Nanigans. For the type, Lewis was something of an unparalleled virtuoso. (Johnson, who worked with Lewis at Google, later confessed to me: &quot;One of the strengths that I bring to the table is that I’m good at translating Randall’s genius into something the rest of us can understand.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Streamer&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmarks that advertising companies use are fundamentally misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

But when you’re running these experiments … well, when things look too good to be true, they usually are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis explained that the whole thing is pear-shaped because for the most part, the industry is in the sway of the same wrong-headed statistical line of thought. The online marketing world has the same strategy as Luigi’s Pizzeria and the flyer-handling teens. That’s where eBay had gone wrong with search advertising. But the same thing happens with banner advertising, Instagram videos and Facebook ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmarks that advertising companies use – intended to measure the number of clicks, sales and downloads that occur after an ad is viewed – are fundamentally misleading. None of these benchmarks distinguish between the selection effect (clicks, purchases and downloads that are happening anyway) and the advertising effect (clicks, purchases and downloads that would not have happened without ads).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse: the brightest minds of this generation are creating algorithms which only increase the effects of selection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following: if Amazon buys clicks from Facebook and Google, the advertising platforms’ algorithms will seek out Amazon clickers. And who is most likely to click on Amazon? Presumably Amazon’s regular customers. In that case the algorithms are generating clicks, but not necessarily extra clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising platforms are not the only ones susceptible to this flawed way of thinking. Advertisers make the same error. They’re targeting personalised ads at an audience that is already very likely to buy their product. You watch a Renault commercial, and then your screen is taken over by Twingos. You put a dress in an online shopping basket, then it’s stalking you across the internet.

&lt;p&gt;The majority of advertising companies feed their complex algorithms silos full of data even though the practice never delivers the desired result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never really thought about this. Algorithmic targeting may be technologically ingenious, but if you’re targeting the wrong thing then it’s of no use to advertisers. Most advertising platforms can’t tell clients whether their algorithms are just putting fully-automated teenagers in the waiting area (increasing the selection effect) or whether they’re bringing in people who wouldn’t have come in otherwise (increasing the advertising effect). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are setting ourselves up for failure,&quot; Lewis explained, &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;Another important way the system is failing has nothing to do with advertising platforms or advertisers, but with internet users’ behaviour. People only see online ads when they’re online, but being online in the first place means that they are more likely to shop online too. Yahoo! economists demonstrated this by means of an experiment. A brand banner was displayed for several weeks on Yahoo.com (an Audi banner, if you must know). A paltry 35 million visitors saw that Audi ad. The study showed that people who saw the ad searched for &amp;quot;Audi&amp;quot; twelve times more often than people who hadn’t seen the banner. A successful campaign, you might say. Well... 15 million other visitors to Yahoo.com were not shown the Audi banner. They got a sympathetic NGO banner instead (&amp;quot;Help this turtle&amp;quot;). And lo and behold: the turtle people also searched for &amp;quot;Audi&amp;quot; twelve times more often than the group that had seen neither banner. How could it be? What have turtles got to do with Audi? Nothing. But the turtle people and the Audi people did have something in common: both groups were online, saw an ad, and looked something up on a search engine. &quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Another important way the system is failing has nothing to do with advertising platforms or advertisers, but with internet users&amp;amp;#039; behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;We currently assume that advertising companies always benefit from more data. And certainly, live-gaming is more likely to appeal to gamers. But the majority of advertising companies feed their complex algorithms silos full of data even though the practice never delivers the desired result. In the worst case, all that invasion of privacy can even lead to targeting the wrong group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insight is conspicuously absent from the debate about online privacy. At the moment, we don’t even know whether all this privacy violation works as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Run an experiment!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily there is a way to measure the unadulterated effect of ads: do an experiment. Divide the target group into two random cohorts in advance: one group sees the ad, the other does not. Designing the experiment thus excludes the effects of selection&lt;/p&gt;

Initially it was assumed that the retailer’s ad would only have to be shown 1,490 times before one person &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;This naive analysis breaks down as follows: the percentage of consumers who saw the ad and then bought something (in this case: 0.284 % of them) minus the percentage of consumers who did not see the ad but then bought something (in this case: 0.217% of them). Therefore, the ad is: 0.067% effective.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; This naive analysis breaks down as follows: the percentage of consumers who saw the ad and then bought something (in this case: 0.284 % of them) minus the percentage of consumers who did not see the ad but then bought something (in this case: 0.217% of them).

In other words, the selection effects were almost 10 times stronger than the advertising effect alone! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this was no exception. Selection effects substantially outweighed advertising effects in most of these Facebook experiments. &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;Now any good data analyst would say: that’s all fine and well, but there’s no need to experiment when you can just correct. Let’s return to the flyer guys in the pizzeria waiting area for a minute. It’s possible to create a model in which the distance from the pizzeria is also accounted for. This way, flyers handed out inside the pizzeria are rewarded a lower ‘score’ than flyers given to people outside the pizzeria. In short, the influence of all manner of things that play into purchasing decisions can be corrected for, leaving you with only that of the ad itself. That means you have to know all the factors that could possibly shape the purchasing decision (such as age, gender, post code, preferences, online activity, and so on and so forth) and you need good data on these factors. What Zettelmeyer et al. demonstrated at Facebook was that even with the very best data – the researchers knew basically everything that anyone’s ever done on Facebook – he could not correct for the selection bias. &amp;quot;The methods we study still yielded biased estimates of the causal effects of advertising in a majority of cases.&amp;quot; A delicate economic palate is required to appreciate this point, but it’s worth savouring. Observational methods correct for any non-random factors, which leaves just a mote of random ones to work with. Machine learning algorithms are intended, though, to exclude the random: who ultimately sees an ad is increasingly determined. So, as the algorithms become more effective, it becomes harder to assess their effectiveness! &quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Now any good data analyst would say: that&amp;amp;#039;s all fine and well, but there&amp;amp;#039;s no need to experiment when you can just correct.

&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/93347ccb438e407faa7d71949617c9eb.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we arrive at perhaps the most fundamental question: what, in the end, is there really to know in advertising? Can advertisers ever know exactly what their ad brings in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google CEO Eric Schmidt told his TV colleague Mel Karmazin that when it comes to online advertising, that question was easy to answer. Lewis went on to work for Schmidt, but research he conducted for Yahoo! in 2011 puts the lie to that claim. The title of his paper: &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;The paper was later published as: ‘The unfavorable economics of measuring the returns to advertising.’ &quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; The paper was later published as: &amp;amp;#039;The unfavorable economics of measuring the returns to advertising.&amp;amp;#039; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__source&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9c96/a3107c4d7a3d42713c885ed52e11688a4f05.pdf&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lewis, Randall A., and Justin M. Rao. &amp;amp;quot;The unfavorable economics of measuring the returns to advertising.&amp;amp;quot; The Quarterly Journal of Economics 130.4 (2015): 1941-1973.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-40ef0139-cf16-45eb-aec2-5acb226cb12f&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;On the near impossibility of measuring the returns to advertising.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-40ef0139-cf16-45eb-aec2-5acb226cb12f&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointment had been the study’s driving force. At Yahoo!, Lewis had run 25 gigantic ad-experiments. And still, he was left with a lot of uncertainty about the actual effects of advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People thought that after a one-million-person experiment, we could walk away, and know exactly how advertising works,&quot; Johnson recalled. He added, &quot;if you’ve got a million you should be able to count angels dancing on pins.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what went wrong? If you want to measure something small, you have to go big. Let’s say I want to know how many people have the rare disease cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis affects one in 3,400 people (0.03%). But let’s say I don’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I open the phone book and I call 10,000 people. Plus another 10,000. And another 10,000. Then another 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/e6b49f24712842acbc64bf3bc3623a56.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you see, the results of my poll are all over the place. 10,000 is simply too small a sample to get reliable estimates. We’d better call a million people. And another million. And another million. Now we’re getting somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/1a704ef8c068446f8262b6bc72df24e0.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine, then, that I had wanted to know how many people had contracted the flu last year (one in 20). Ten thousand calls would have been enough to get reliable estimates. More people get the flu, so a flu study can have smaller test groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/c0fb4f4062d4407aba3d08922387775e.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, advertising is like cystic fibrosis, not the flu. And even that’s extremely unfair to cystic fibrosis, since people buying things because they saw an ad is even rarer than cystic fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson sighs: &quot;It’s very hard to change behaviour by showing people pictures and movies that they don’t want to look at.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, consider Steve Tadelis’s eBay research. Ebay lost 63 cents on every dollar they put into Google search advertising, but that’s actually an imprecise estimate. If the experiment were to be replicated infinitely (and another ad stop, and another ad stop, and another ad stop...), in 95% of all ad stops the loss would fall in the range of negative $1.24 and negative $0.03. This is what statisticians call the confidence interval. In advertising research, the confidence interval tends to be huge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay’s performance was so shoddy that the only logical conclusion would have been: stop buying search ads! But if eBay’s marketing had been just a tiny bit more effective – say they only lost 10 cents on every dollar they invested – then their experiment would have shown that the marketing department had delivered something between a 70 cent loss and a 50 cent profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Streamer&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising does far less than most advertisers believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good is information like this? Such experiments tend to have an either-or conclusion: the campaign was either profitable or it wasn’t. This may give you a sense of direction, but it cannot provide certainty. &quot;Simply rejecting that a campaign was a total waste of money is not an ambitious goal,&quot; Randall Lewis wrote in his study. Still, in practice, that proved ‘nearly impossible’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising rationally, the way it’s described in economic textbooks, is unattainable. Then how do advertisers know what they ought to pay for ads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, basically they don’t know,&quot; Lewis said in one of those throw-away clauses that kept running through my head for days after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep that in mind the next time you read one of those calamity stories about Google, Facebook or Cambridge Analytica. If people were easier to manipulate with images and videos they don’t really want to see, economists would have a much easier task. Realistically, advertising does something, but only a small something – and at any rate it does far less than most advertisers believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What frustrates me is there’s a bit of magical thinking here,&quot; Johnson says. &quot;As if Cambridge Analytica has hacked our brains so that we’re going to be like lemmings and jump off cliffs. As if we are powerless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/27b159e3e35248af97812c893fe21309.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we arrive at our final question: who wants to know the truth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a question that has long fascinated the economist Justin Rao (who’s worked for Yahoo!, Microsoft and others). Before he worked on advertising, &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;See Augenblick, Ned, et al. &amp;quot;The economics of faith: using an apocalyptic prophecy to elicit religious beliefs in the field.&amp;quot; Journal of Public Economics 141 (2016): 38-49.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__source&amp;quot;&amp;gt; See &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272716300779&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Augenblick, Ned, et al. &amp;amp;quot;The economics of faith: using an apocalyptic prophecy to elicit religious beliefs in the field.&amp;amp;quot; Journal of Public Economics 141 (2016): 38-49.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-909d743e-b286-4174-ba65-a9a84d73ac92&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;he did field research with a cult that predicted the end of days on 21 May 2011.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon mod-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-infocard-source&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-909d743e-b286-4174-ba65-a9a84d73ac92&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rao awarded prizes to cult members. Those willing to accept their prize after Judgement Day – when the world would be annihilated and the faithful would ascend to heaven – were promised more money. Their belief in the apocalypse proved uncompromising. Even an extra 500 dollars couldn’t seduce the cultists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beliefs formed on insufficient evidence seem tough to move,&quot; Rao wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rao joined Microsoft, the eBay studies by Steve Tadelis had just been published and were all over the media: the Harvard Business Review, The Economist, The Atlantic and the BBC all covered the story. Marketing blogs couldn’t stop talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Rao, &quot;Probably even Steve’s mother e-mailed him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But did it matter? At Microsoft, Rao had a search engine at his disposal: Bing. Following the news about the millions of dollars eBay had wasted, brand keyword advertising only declined by 10%.  &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;And it wasn’t because it was working for them. Rao got to research whether Advertisers squandered money on search ads matched to their own brand names. The answer was conclusive: ‘yes.’ If, for example, BestBuy was the only buyer for &amp;quot;BestBuy&amp;quot; search ads, brand name advertising would only lead to a mere 2% to 3% additional clicks. More than eBay’s nothing, but it is hardly enough to warrant the investment. But there was one group of advertisers with a valid reason to purchase own brand name ads. Not that they were any more effective for this group, but because their competitors were &amp;quot;crowding them out&amp;quot; by buying ads that targeted the brand owner’s name (so you search for &amp;quot;Bestbuy&amp;quot; but a sponsored ad for &amp;quot;Walmart&amp;quot; tops the list). This can enable Walmart to steal 20% of Bestbuy’s organic search traffic.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; And it wasn&amp;amp;#039;t because it was working for them. Rao got to research whether Advertisers squandered money on search ads matched to their own brand names.

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the eBay news did not even encourage advertisers to experiment more was perhaps the most striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rao did observe the occasional &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;The decision not to advertise was not necessarily always motivated by companies’ experimental drive; they could have been over budget, or maybe someone was angry at Bing or an employee had left, who knows.&quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; The decision not to advertise was not necessarily always motivated by companies&amp;amp;#039; experimental drive; they could have been over budget, or maybe someone was angry at Bing or an employee had left, who knows. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-e504399f-6b6c-456a-9b32-7ec7cf603608&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;ad stop at Bing.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-e504399f-6b6c-456a-9b32-7ec7cf603608&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rao was able to use ad stops like these, just as Tadelis had at eBay, to assess the effects on search traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;See Rao, Justin M., and Andrey Simonov. &amp;quot;Firms’ reactions to public information on business practices: The case of search advertising.&amp;quot; Quantitative Marketing and Economics 17.2 (2019): 105-134. &quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__source&amp;quot;&amp;gt; See &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b003/d2e2e95b60f1553023b8149436629652bd5c.pdf&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Rao, Justin M., and Andrey Simonov. &amp;amp;quot;Firms’ reactions to public information on business practices: The case of search advertising.&amp;amp;quot; Quantitative Marketing and Economics 17.2 (2019): 105-134. &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-0f0c42ee-34c8-4a78-ba19-af1d685c7c8d&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;When these experiments showed that ads were utterly pointless, advertisers were not bothered in the slightest. They charged gaily ahead, buying ad after ad.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon mod-source&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-infocard-source&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-0f0c42ee-34c8-4a78-ba19-af1d685c7c8d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even when they knew, or could have known, that their ad campaigns were not very profitable, it had no impact on how they behaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beliefs formed on insufficient evidence seem tough to move.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#FitGirl analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Tadelis saw this first-hand too. The financial director of eBay asked Tadelis to look into the second item on the list of so-called success campaigns: affiliate marketing. An example of this type of advertising could be eBay paying some influencer #fitgirl to embed a link to a particular brand of yoga pants in an Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affiliate marketing boss was okay with Tadelis experimenting, but he did issue a caveat. &quot;Let me tell you something Steve,&quot; he had said. &quot;If we run this experiment, and the results look like what you showed us with search advertising, I’m not going to believe you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was clear to me that he meant it,&quot; Tadelis recalled. &quot;So I told him: ‘Well, if this is about religion, I can’t help you. I have nothing against religion, I just don’t think it has a place in marketing analytics.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound crazy, but companies are not equipped to assess whether their ad spending actually makes money. It is in the best interest of a firm like eBay to know whether its campaigns are profitable, but not so for eBay’s marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its own interest is in securing the largest possible budget, which is much easier if you can demonstrate that what you do actually works. Within the marketing department, TV, print and digital compete with each other to show who’s more important, a dynamic that hardly promotes honest reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that management often has no idea how to interpret the numbers is not helpful either. The highest numbers win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randall Lewis told me about a meeting with the man responsible for evaluating Yahoo’s marketing strategy. The man had apparently done everything Lewis had advised against – and worse. He graciously admitted that he either added or omitted data to his model if it led to the ‘wrong’ results. Lewis: &quot;I was like: oh man. All of that is bad scientific practice, but it’s actually great job preservation practice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bad methodology makes everyone happy,” said David Reiley, who used to head Yahoo’s economics team and is now working for streaming service Pandora. &quot;It will make the publisher happy. It will make the person who bought the media happy. It will make the boss of the person who bought the media happy. It will make the ad agency happy. Everybody can brag that they had a very successful campaign.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers are often most successful at marketing their own marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is online advertising working? We simply don’t know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, what’s driving this phenomenon is something much more profound. Something that applies not just to advertising. &quot;There is a fear that saying ‘I don’t know’ amounts to an admission of incompetence,&quot; Tadelis observed. &quot;But ignorance is not incompetence, curiosity is not incompetence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want certainty. We used to find it in the Don Drapers of the world, the ones with the best one-liners up their sleeves. Today we look for certainty from data analysts who are supposed to just show us the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis admitted that it’s not all bad. Decisions have to be made, somebody has to lay out a strategy, doubt must stop at some point. For that reason, companies hire overconfident people who act like they know what they cannot possibly know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis could never do the sort of work they do. &quot;I would feel like it’s a random coin toss for most decisions,&quot; he said. But somebody has to toss the coin. And a company full of Randalls only leads to analysis paralysis. Nothing happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contentitem-image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://useruploads.cdn-thecorrespondent.com/svg/7552a2151eea4d68bcf1407c0ade731c.svg&quot; srcset=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randall Lewis had left Google and was working for Netflix when he attended the Datalead Conference in Paris in November 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His time at Yahoo! and Google had taught him how difficult it is to advertise better. But Lewis wasn’t out to blind with science, he didn’t want to burn it all down and turn his back. He wanted to make the near impossible just a little bit more possible. And let’s be honest: advertising a bit better is actually quite a lot compared to stumbling about in the dark.  It can prevent blunders of the eBay sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;Streamer&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Marketeers actually believe that their marketing works, even if it doesn’t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis had come to Paris to present one of his improvements. At Google, he &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard js-contentitem-infocard mod-regular&quot; title=&quot;This platform is called ‘ghost ads’. &quot; data-content=&quot; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__body&amp;quot;&amp;gt; This platform is called &amp;amp;#039;ghost ads&amp;amp;#039;. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;contentitem-infocard__source&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://causaleffect.io/ghost-ads-a-revolution-in-measuring-ad-effectiveness.pdf&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Johnson, Garrett A., Randall A. Lewis, and Elmar I. Nubbemeyer. &amp;amp;quot;Ghost ads: Improving the economics of measuring online ad effectiveness.&amp;amp;quot; Journal of Marketing Research 54.6 (2017): 867-884.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-341b70d7-43f4-42bb-a09d-a5a93fe28f75&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle js-contentitem-infocard-toggle&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__snippit&quot;&gt;had built a platform that gives advertisers a cheap and simple way to experiment with banner ads.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__toggle-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot; icon icon-chevron-down&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;contentitem-infocard__content js-contentitem-infocard-content&quot; id=&quot;contentitem-infocard-contents-341b70d7-43f4-42bb-a09d-a5a93fe28f75&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   &quot;I think this is a revolution in advertising,&quot; he said proudly. Buyers could finally optimise for the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a quarter of the way through his presentation, an audience member stood up and asked: do advertising companies actually want to know this? Aren’t they primarily interested in research that reassures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s actually endemic to the entire industry,&quot; Lewis replied. He started on one of his brilliantly inaccessible Lewisian responses. &quot;The moral hazard problem is a series of cognitive dissonance biases …&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through his impenetrable answer, another audience member interruption. This time it came from Steve Tadelis. &quot;What Randall is trying to say,&quot; the former eBay economist interjected, &quot;is that marketeers actually believe that their marketing works, even if it doesn’t. Just like we believe our research is important, even if it isn’t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis laughed. &quot;Thank you, Steve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/strong&gt; founder &lt;strong&gt;Brewster Kahle&lt;/strong&gt; gave a keynote address at the Charleston Conference this morning in which he and &lt;strong&gt;Better World Books CEO, Dustin Holland,&lt;/strong&gt; announced that &lt;strong&gt;Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt; is now owned by a non-profit affiliated with &lt;strong&gt;Internet Archive, Better World Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;. This is seen as as a major step forward toward their joint mission: providing access to the knowledge in books to everyone in the world. Now libraries who deaccession to BWB can have even greater social impact, because the Internet Archive will acquire, digitize, lend, store and digitally preserve millions of books from BWB’s inventory over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, they will be sharing a &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Finternet-archive-wikipedia-more-reliable%2F&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CGilsonT%40cofc.edu%7Cf05f27e2e10a41f91c4c08d760a8b50f%7Ce285d438dbba4a4c941c593ba422deac%7C0%7C0%7C637084150029911613&amp;amp;sdata=ipiCo7qp%2BioX6fkNe%2Bb%2F%2FTAa9SbSKhvnPNevOMKEsIE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;has-inline-color&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;major dissemination program for their digitized books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;has-inline-color&quot;&gt;through clickable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; citations in &lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; articles in 8 different languages. So that digital learners, scholars, journalists and editors can dive deeper–and fact check the sources–in the articles of the world’s #5 website, &lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt;. At a time when the veracity of facts is being challenged, we believe this partnership between &lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Internet Archive,&lt;/strong&gt; with resources from &lt;strong&gt;Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt;, can help bolster information integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the official press release below&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt;, the world’s leading socially conscious online bookseller, is now owned by &lt;strong&gt;Better World Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;, a mission-aligned, not-for-profit organization that is affiliated with longtime partner the &lt;strong&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/strong&gt;.  This groundbreaking partnership will allow both organizations to pursue their collective mission of making knowledge universally accessible to readers everywhere. This new relationship will provide additional resources and newfound synergies backed by a shared enthusiasm for advancing global literacy. Together, the two organizations are expanding the digital frontier of book preservation to ensure books are accessible to all for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new relationship will allow Better World Books to provide a steady stream of books to be digitized by the Internet Archive, thereby growing its digital holdings to millions of books. Libraries that work alongside Better World Books will now make a bigger impact than ever. Any book that does not yet exist in digital form will go into a pipeline for future digitization, preservation and access. According to &lt;strong&gt;Brewster Kahle&lt;/strong&gt;, Founder and Digital Librarian at the Internet Archive, “The &lt;strong&gt;Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt; origin story is inspiring, and the service they provide to libraries is invaluable. These are our kind of people. We share their values, and we are proud to partner with Better World Books and libraries around the world to promote the goal of universal access to all knowledge.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt; was born in 2001, when a group of recent college graduates sold their used textbooks online. Their success eventually led to the creation of a revolutionary new business model where used books are collected primarily from libraries, booksellers, colleges, and universities in six countries and then are either resold online, donated or recycled. To date, Better World Books has donated almost 27 million books worldwide, has raised close to $29 million for libraries and literacy and has saved more than 326 million books from landfills. With the backing of the not-for-profit &lt;strong&gt;Better World Libraries, Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt; will enhance these valuable services to libraries and readers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;strong&gt;Jim Michalko,&lt;/strong&gt; former president of &lt;strong&gt;The Research Libraries Group, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt; board member, “This new relationship is a win for the library community. One of the biggest challenges facing libraries today is responsibly removing materials from their shelves so they can bring in more desirable materials or repurpose space to fit community needs. &lt;strong&gt;Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt; has always been a trusted partner in this activity. Now, libraries can provide books to Better World Books knowing that a digital copy will be created and preserved if one doesn’t yet exist. That’s responsible collection management.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I&lt;strong&gt;nternet Archive&lt;/strong&gt; has long been committed to digitizing books and library materials so they can be accessed by users all over the world. Through digitization, these materials can be used by researchers in large-scale, data-driven computing investigations, preserved in both digital and physical form, and where appropriate, loaned to readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dustin Holland,&lt;/strong&gt; the newly appointed President and CEO of Better World Books, underscores, “We exist to make a difference in the world, and our customers make that possible. We are honored to join the Internet Archive family, and our partnership allows us to extract the maximum value out of every book we collect at scale, while continuing to delight readers all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Better World Books offices and operations remain unchanged by this transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Internet Archive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.Archive.org&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;has-inline-color&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form. Like a physical library, the Internet Archive provides free access to its resources for researchers, historians, scholars, the print disabled and the general public. Its mission is to provide Universal Access to All Knowledge. Since its launch in 1996, the Internet Archive has archived over 380 billion web pages, over 20 million books and texts and over 4.5 million audio recordings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Better World Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.BetterWorldBooks.com&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;has-inline-color&quot;&gt;Better World Books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a for-profit socially conscious business and a global online bookseller that collects and sells new and used books online matching each purchase with a book donation, Book-for-Book™. Each sale generates funds for literacy and education initiatives in the UK, US, and around the world. Since its launch in 2003, Better World Books has raised close to $29 million for libraries and literacy, donated almost 27 million books and reused or recycled more than 326 million books.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In Praise of the 5-Hour Workday and Other ‘Radical’ Ideas</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A German entrepreneur named Lasse Rheingans has become a subject of attention since The Wall Street Journal &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-5-hour-workday-gets-put-to-the-test-11571876563&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; on a novel idea he has put in place at his 16-person technology start-up: a five-hour workday. Mr. Rheingans is not just reducing the time his employees spend in the office; he’s reducing the total time they spend working altogether. They arrive at 8 a.m. and leave at 1 p.m., at which point they’re not expected to work until the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This distinction between time in the office and time spent working is critical. In our current age of email and smartphones, work has pervaded more and more of our waking hours — evenings, mornings, weekends, vacations — rendering the idea of a fixed workday as quaint. We’re driven to these extremes by some vague sense that all of this frantic communicating will make us more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Rheingans is betting that we have this wrong. His experiment is premised on the idea that once you remove time-wasting distractions and constrain inefficient conversation &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; your work, five hours should be sufficient to accomplish most of the core activities that actually move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To support this new approach, he has employees leave their phones in their bags at the office and blocks access to social media on the company network. Strict rules reduce time spent in meetings (most of which are now limited to 15 minutes or less). Perhaps most important, his employees now check work email only twice each day — no drawn out back-and-forth exchanges fragmenting their attention, no surreptitious inbox checks while at dinner or on the sidelines of their kids’ sporting events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal described Mr. Rheingans’s approach as “radical.” But as someone who thinks and writes about the future of work in a high-tech age, I’ve come to believe that what’s really radical is the fact that many more organizations aren’t trying similar experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s easy to forget that the way so many of us work today is new. The term “knowledge work” wasn’t introduced until Peter Drucker’s 1959 book, “Landmarks of Tomorrow,” in which he argued that “work that is based on the mind” was poised to emerge as a major sector of an economy that was still at the time dominated by industrial production. He was of course right — by some estimates, close to half the United States work force is now engaged &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2016/04/job-polarization/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in these cognitive professions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But early knowledge work was still quite different from our modern professional lifestyle. To get from the “Man in the Gray Flannel Suit” era of long lunches and secretaries screening calls to our current experience of constant frantic connection, we must wait until the arrival of networked desktop computers during the 1980s and 1990s, which connected us digitally through tools like email, followed by the smartphone revolution in the 2000s, which made this connectivity ubiquitous. The approach to cognitive work that Mr. Rheingans’s “radical” plan seeks to upend, in other words, is at best 10 to 20 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The history of technology and commerce teaches us that we should be skeptical of the idea that we’ve somehow figured out the best way to conduct knowledge work in the network age in such a short time. Consider an analogous revolution: the slow evolution of complex manufacturing. As late as 1913, Henry Ford, like most other automakers at the time, still built cars using the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=iYUrDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;newbks=1&amp;amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=behemoth&amp;amp;pg=PT177#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=%22craft%20method%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“craft method,”&lt;/a&gt; in which each vehicle was constructed in a fixed spot on the factory floor, with workers bringing over the various pieces needed for its assembly. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=iYUrDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;newbks=1&amp;amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=behemoth&amp;amp;pg=PT177#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=magneto&amp;amp;f=false&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Complex components like the magnetos&lt;/a&gt; were still constructed by hand by a single skilled worker at a stationary work bench. Cars at this point, in other words, were still being put together in largely the same way that Karl Benz built the first practical automobile three decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The craft method of manufacturing was simple and convenient — directly scaling up the natural approach artisans had always used to assemble complex artifacts. But then Ford launched a series of bold experiments to explore approaches to this work that would trade simplicity and convenience for vastly more effectiveness. These experiments, of course, were successful. In early 1913, the labor time required to produce a Model T was around 12½ hours. By 1914, after Ford instituted the continuous-flow assembly line supported by specialized tools, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=iYUrDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;newbks=1&amp;amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=behemoth&amp;amp;pg=PT179#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=ninety-three%20minutes&amp;amp;f=false&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this time dropped&lt;/a&gt; to only 93 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I believe that knowledge work today is where automobile manufacturing was in 1913. The way we currently work is simple and convenient. Because everyone can talk to everyone at any time through email and instant messages, we just let work flow along as an unstructured conversation made up of missives flying back and forth through the electronic ether. This scales up the way we’ve always naturally collaborated in small groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What Lasse Rheingans is attempting, by contrast, is much less simple and convenient. If I can’t simply reach you with a quick email at any time, my work is going to require more forethought; some things might even get missed, some clients occasionally made upset. But it’s worth remembering that the assembly line was also much more complicated and much less convenient than the craft method it replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To believe, in other words, that our current approach to knowledge work — which is brand-new on any reasonable scale of business history — is the best way to create valuable information using the human mind is both arrogant and ahistoric. It’s the equivalent of striding into an early-20th-century automobile factory, where each car still required a half day’s worth of labor to produce, and boldly proclaiming, “I think we’ve figured this one out!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If I’m right and we’re still early in this new phase of digital knowledge work, then more productive — and hopefully much more meaningful and much less draining — approaches to executing this work remain on the horizon. No one knows exactly what this future of knowledge work will look like, but I suspect, along with Mr. Rheingans, that among other transformations it will reject the idea that always-on electronic chatter is a good way to efficiently extract value from human minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is why I am heartened to see stories like that of Mr. Rheingans’s short workday and, as was reported this week, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40?utm_campaign=npr&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_term=nprnews&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft Japan’s experiments&lt;/a&gt; with a four-day week during the summer (which increased its productivity by 40 percent, according to the company). It’s not yet clear that these innovations are exactly the right way to run technology companies, or whether they can scale to other business contexts. But what is right in this case is the exploratory mind-set that led to these experiments in the first place. If like many digital knowledge workers, you’re exhausted by endless work and flooded inboxes, the good news is that better and more sustainable ways of producing valuable output with your brain might be coming — if we can find enough visionaries willing to try out “radical” new ideas about how best to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Man Underpaid Property Tax by $8.41 County Seized Home, Sold It-Kept Profits</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An 83-year-old retired engineer in Michigan underpaid his property taxes by $8.41. In response, Oakland County seized his property, auctioned it off to settle the debt, and pocketed nearly $24,500 in excess revenue from the sale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under Michigan law, it was all legal. And hardly uncommon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uri Rafaeli, who lost his property and all the equity associated with it, is just one of thousands of people to be victimized by Michigan's uniquely aggressive property tax statute. The law, passed in 1999 in an attempt to accelerate the rehabilitation of abandoned properties,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;empowers county treasurers to act as debt collectors. In the process, it creates a perverse incentive by allowing treasurers' offices to retain excess revenue raised by seizing and selling properties with delinquent taxes—even when the amount owed is miniscule, and even when the homes aren't abandoned or blighted at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organizations representing property owners like Rafaeli say the practice is unconstitutional, inequitable, and unreasonably harsh. They call it &quot;home equity theft&quot;—a process that's a close relative to the civil asset forfeiture laws that have been used by police departments to similarly deprive innocent Americans of their property without due process. They are now asking the state Supreme Court to restrict the practice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Michigan is currently stealing from people across the state,&quot; says Christina Martin, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit law firm now representing Rafaeli and other homeowners in a class-action lawsuit that will go before the Michigan Supreme Court in early November.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Counties have been authorized to take not just what they are owed, but to take people's life savings.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Win-Win Situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rafaeli's case—which has the potential to stop the predatory behavior of county treasurers across the state—began with a simple mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-8031694&quot; src=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/uri-1939-683x1024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; data-credit=&quot;Photo courtesy Pacific Legal Foundation&quot; srcset=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/uri-1939-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/uri-1939-200x300.jpg 200w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/uri-1939-768x1152.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Uri Rafaeli
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In August 2011, Rafaeli purchased a three-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot home in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/southfieldcitymichigan&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;predominantly African American community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of Southfield, Michigan, a lower-middle-class suburb just north of Detroit. &quot;The investment was good to the state economy, and [at] the same time, it may produce a good rent for my retirement. A 'win-win' situation,&quot; says Rafaeli, who lived in neighboring Macomb County at the time. (He no longer lives in Michigan.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The $60,000 purchase was recorded by the Oakland County Register of Deeds on January 6, 2012. About six months later, in June 2012, Rafaeli was notified that he had underpaid his 2011 property tax bill by $496. Rafaeli made subsequent property tax payments on time and in full—and, in January 2013, he attempted to settle the unpaid tax debt, according to court documents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But he made a mistake in calculating the interest owed, resulting in another underpayment of $8.41. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A little more than a year later, in February 2014, Rafaeli's rental property was one of 11,000 properties put up for auction by Oakland County. It was sold for $24,500 in August of the same year—far less than what Rafaeli had paid for the property just three years earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, real estate service Zillow, which rates the Southfield region as a &quot;hot&quot; market in the Detroit region,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/20159-Mada-Ave-Southfield-MI-48075/24608758_zpid/?fullpage=true&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;estimates the property is worth $128,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, But Rafaeli has missed out on reaping a financial reward for being an early investor in the area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Uri Rafaeli's house and surrounding property in Southfield, Michigan.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believed in the power of the U.S. to withstand the difficulties,&quot; says Rafaeli, &quot;and I believed in its fairness and dignity in doing business there.&quot; Now, he says, he thinks differently. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Punitive for Property Owners, and Profitable for the County&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In court documents, Rafaeli's attorneys estimate there have been more than 100,000 properties—along with the &quot;entire equity in them&quot;—that have been taken by Michigan counties since 2002. &quot;In thousands of instances each year, the proceeds for a given property sold at auction far exceed the delinquent tax amount and are far less than a delinquent taxpayer's equity in the property,&quot; they argue. &quot;This results in millions of dollars in surplus proceeds and equity for the counties and tax sale purchasers.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the root of those seizures is a 1999 update to Michigan's general property tax statute. That legislation, Act 123 of 1999, gave Michigan's 83 county treasurers the authority to act as the primary agents for handing the foreclosure and auction of properties with unpaid taxes. It also expedited the process for seizing and auctioning homes that owed taxes, allowing county treasuries to sweep aside liens and other speed bumps in the tax foreclosure process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legislation's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/1999-2000/billanalysis/House/htm/1999-HLA-4489-B.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;were &quot;to encourage the rapid reuse of property, prevent the onset of blight, and improve the overall use of property&quot; in the state, according to a 2011 University of Michigan&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/urbanplanning/students/student-work/master-urban-planning/revenue-reuse-managing-tax-reverted&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about the effects of Act 123 in Wayne County—where Detroit is located, and where the 1999 law has had the most devastating effects on homeowners.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the past decade, more than 150,000 properties in Detroit have gone through the tax forfeiture process, according to data collected by Jerry Paffendorf, the founder of Loveland Technologies, a Detroit-based mapping firm. The process, says Paffendorf, is &quot;punitive for property owners and profitable for the county.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paffendorf became increasingly interested in Michigan's unique tax foreclosure rules shortly after Detroit's 2013 bankruptcy, when his company worked with an anti-blight task force to identify and photograph abandoned properties across the city. At the time, the media was fascinated with Detroit's economic collapse—one of the most memorable signs of which were the homes being auctioned for $1,000 or less. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As he began tracking the supposedly vacant homes being auctioned off by the city, Paffendorf noticed an odd trend: Lots of them weren't actually vacant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;There was sort of an assumption that tax foreclosures were happening to abandoned buildings. You know, properties that people had left,&quot; he tells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But that wasn't always the case. &quot;We saw thousands of properties that had people living in them being auctioned.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was happening because of the accelerated foreclosure process created by Act 123, which harshly punished any Michigander for falling behind on property tax payments. Prior to 1999, the average time between a property falling into tax delinquency and foreclosure was five to seven years, but Act 123 reduced that timeline to a little over two years. The accelerated foreclosure process caught many homeowners who fell behind on their taxes during the Great Recession. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Michigan, property taxes are due twice per year. Bills are sent in July and December, with payments due in April and November. If there are outstanding debts from the previous year, delinquent properties are turned over to the county in March the following year. The county buys the debt from municipalities—the funding comes from the county's &quot;delinquent tax revolving fund&quot; (DTRF)—and the county effectively becomes the debt collector for the unpaid taxes. Under state law, counties are allowed to impose a one-time 4 percent administrative fee to each delinquent property, and may charge 1 percent interest for every month the tax remains unpaid. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the property owner still owes back taxes by March 31 of the third year of delinquency—that is, two years and 31 days after the county took over the collection process—the county can foreclose and take the property to auction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Source:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oakgov.com/treasurer/Documents/property_tax_foreclosure_brochure.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oakland County Treasurer's Office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After a property is auctioned, the county keeps the proceeds and recycles the revenue through the same DTRF used to buy the debt from municipalities in the first place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the county ends up with a positive balance in its DTRF, the excess funds can be channeled into the county budget. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's how Wayne County has funneled more than $382 million in delinquent tax surpluses into its general fund budget since 2012, according to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/sorry-we-foreclosed-your-home-thanks-fixing-our-budget&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an analysis by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Michigan-based nonprofit publication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Oakland County, where Rafaeli's Southfield property was seized and sold in 2014, the process has been lucrative too. According to the county's most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oakgov.com/mgtbud/fiscal/Documents/FY2018_CAFR.pdf&quot;&gt;comprehensive annual financial report&lt;/a&gt;, its DTRF had $196.8 million in net assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The same document details plans to use the DTRF for a number of pet projects, including the construction of a new animal shelter and adoption center. The county also &quot;anticipates the continuation of annual transfers from the DTRF to support General Fund / General Purpose operations in the amount of $3.0 million annually for FY 2019 through FY 2023″—totals that are in line with historical norms, according to the annual report. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's hundreds of millions of dollars in private equity that have been transferred to the two counties' control—completely legally, under the terms of Act 123. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It is simply government-sanctioned theft,&quot; says private attorney Philip Ellison. Ellison has been involved in a series of class-action lawsuits targeting nine Michigan counties' use of home equity forfeiture over the past six years, during which time, he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Clerks/Documents/2018-2019/156849/156849_120_01_AC_Individuals.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;calculates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, counties in Michigan have pocketed more than $36 million in surplus equity seized from tax delinquent properties. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ellison represents people like Donald Freed, a resident of Alma, Michigan, who had his&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Clerks/Documents/2018-2019/156849/156849_120_01_AC_Individuals.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;home and 35 acres of land seized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;by Gratiot County, Michigan, over a $750 tax debt. The property was auctioned for more than $100,000—and, of course, the county kept the change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-8031695&quot; src=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/BO7A7205-1024x683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; data-credit=&quot;Photo courtesy Pacific Legal Foundation&quot; srcset=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/BO7A7205-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/BO7A7205-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/BO7A7205-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Romualdo and Erica Perez
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The same thing happened to Romualdo and Erica Perez, a father/daughter duo who bought a four-unit apartment building and an adjacent, abandoned single-family home in Detroit in 2012. Even though they were living in New Jersey at the time, Romualdo would drive 11 hours to Detroit on weekends to fix up the properties in the hopes of eventually relocating there to be closer to other relatives. Romualdo and Erica planned to live in the house and earn a living by renting the small apartment building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Every bit of money we saved and every spare minute we had went to fixing the house,&quot; Erica says. &quot;The plumbing, the electricity—everything.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the first year they owned the property, they underpaid their property taxes by $144. County tax records show that they made full payments, on time, every subsequent year. But Wayne County never informed them of the unpaid debt, they say, because the notices were sent to the wrong address. But the county should have known the correct address for the notices because more recent property tax payments indicated the proper address, says Martin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2017, the county foreclosed on their property, sold it for $108,000, and kept the excess equity beyond the $359 owed in back taxes, fees, and interest. They, too, are suing the state with the assistance of the Pacific Legal Foundation, in a case that's separate from Rafaeli's.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making Detroit a Worse Place to Live&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to destroying the livelihoods of individual property owners, Act 123 has made Detroit a less attractive place to live. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-8031682&quot; src=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/DetroitTaxForeclosure.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;551&quot; height=&quot;346&quot; data-credit=&quot;(Graphic courtesy Loveland Technologies / Jerry Paffendorf)&quot; data-lazy-srcset=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/DetroitTaxForeclosure.jpg 551w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/DetroitTaxForeclosure-300x188.jpg 300w&quot; data-lazy-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Detroit's collapsing structures and vacant lots didn't just happen,&quot; the Obama administration's special Detroit Blight Removal Task Force concluded in its 2013&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6531628-QuickenLoansCommunityFund-Detroit-Foreclosure.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &quot;They are the physical result of dire economic and social forces that pulled the city apart.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The county's aggressive home equity forfeiture scheme seems to be part of the problem. Over a two year period between 2017 and 2018, volunteers working with the Quicken Loan Community Fund, a Detroit-based nonprofit connected to the mortgage company, interviewed more than 60,000 property owners who owed taxes to the city. Most were aware that they owed taxes, but did not have accurate information about the process or the potential consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Worse, the survey found that aggressive use of home equity forfeiture was leaving the city with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;vacant properties, not fewer. &quot;In theory, the annual tax foreclosure auctions are intended to take properties that are neglected and not generating tax revenue, and sell them to owners who will pay taxes and put the properties to productive use,&quot; the Quicken Loans Community Fund report concluded. &quot;In practice, most Detroit homes that have been tax foreclosed do not return to productive use. Instead, speculators who purchase cheap property at auction allow it to deteriorate without paying property taxes, leading to further depressed home values and blight.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paffendorf, whose company was involved in the Quicken survey, says that about 80 percent of tax-foreclosed properties end up abandoned. Some are vacant because they are going through forfeiture, and some are going through forfeiture because they are vacant, he says. But regardless of which way the causation runs, it's fairly obvious that a law that was meant to return tax-delinquent abandoned properties to productive, tax-producing ones is failing to achieve that goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;If you sell houses with people living in them,&quot; Paffendorf tells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, then &quot;you're only creating more vacant properties.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Incentive for County Officials to Steal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The aggressive use of home equity forfeiture under Act 123 has not only failed at its stated goal of returning abandoned homes to productive use, it has created a perverse incentive for county officials to effectively steal from their constituents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the morning of April 1, 2014, Linda Irwin, Cass County's treasurer, emailed a county contractor to say she was &quot;tickled pink&quot; to have the opportunity to seize a $3.5 million lakefront property. The deadline for the property owner to settle an unpaid property tax debt had passed the day before and the county was ready to foreclose. In subsequent emails, the contractor joked with Irwin about using the property to host cookouts for county employees, according to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Clerks/Documents/2018-2019/156849/156849_107_02_AC_2CrookedCreek.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;court documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;attached to a lawsuit against Cass County. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It wasn't until three weeks later that Douglas Anderson, the registered agent who was handling the property and overseeing the construction of a still-unfinished home, became aware anything was wrong. In court documents, lawyers representing Anderson and property owner Sergei Antipov allege the county failed to provide adequate notice about the unpaid property taxes. Cass County argues that it took the appropriate steps required under law, sending two certified letters to the address. Both were returned as undeliverable, likely because there was no one actually living at the address yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was not until April 18, 2014, weeks after the foreclosure deadline had passed, that county officials&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Anderson to tell him the property was being seized. When Anderson and Antipov offered to pay the back taxes, the county refused to accept it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It's a done deal,&quot; Irwin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leaderpub.com/2014/06/24/county-forecloses-on-lakeside-property/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a local newspaper in June 2014. &quot;They've tried to send us a check for $100,000, and I've returned it. I've had my council look at it, and we've done everything right. We didn't make any mistakes. They did.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe so. But the county—and the contractor, Title Check, which works with county treasurers across the state and gets to keep a portion of the proceeds from auctioned properties—does not appear to have done much to alert Antipov that he owed taxes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antipov's situation bears many similarities to the forfeitures that targeted the Rafaeli and Perez properties, among others. In each case, the property owners alleged that they were not given sufficient warning about their delinquent taxes. In some cases, that's because county officials were mailing notices to unfinished homes or properties without permanent residents. In others, like Rafaeli's case, the notices were delivered to tenants who failed to pass along the information to their landlord, mistakenly believing that the county would inform the landlord separately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The county officials involved in each of those lawsuits contend in court documents that they complied with the notification requirements written into state law. Although Act 123 does require that county treasurers make three attempts to contact tax delinquent property owners, attorneys representing the homeowners say more should be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;They don't have to sue in the normal sense,&quot; says Martin. Because the legal action—the forfeiture—is filed against the property itself, the notice required is significantly lower than what is required in other legal matters. And some counties don't include delinquent taxes on subsequent property tax bills, she says. &quot;There is no notice on the new assessments that says 'you have not paid a prior year's bill.'&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Cass County, officials don't appear to have done anything beyond the bare minimum.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Antipov's attorneys say it would have taken a quick online search to find that the property was owned by an LLC registered in Anderson's name and with his Indiana address. Antipov, who owns a metal fabrication company in Indiana, owns another property in Cass County and would have been on the county's tax rolls (and likely known to the treasurer's office) But neither the county nor Title Check made anything other than the bare minimum effort to avoid running out the clock established by Act 123.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;This is a major asset,&quot; Irwin said in 2014. &quot;We can sit on it and decide what to do with it, or we can move forward with an auction.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Irwin &lt;a href=&quot;https://wagnercares.com/tribute/details/1516/Linda-Pruett/obituary.html&quot;&gt;died in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but Cass County is still engaged in a lawsuit over the property. The county has racked up more than $250,000 in legal fees since 2014 defending its right to seize Antipov's property, documents show. The home is still unfinished. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And while some county officials use Michigan's aggressive foreclosure law to benefit their budgets or to provide a setting for backyard barbeques, others use it in ways that are more openly designed to advance municipal self-interest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wayne County Treasurer Eric Sabree has also been caught on camera admitting that Wayne County and the city of Detroit will sometimes conspire to manipulate the auction process. During a 2015 appearance on &quot;Detroit Wants To Know,&quot; a local web series,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxpN4t1C0HA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sabree talked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about how the treasurer's office will bundle properties together in order to make them more attractive to potential buyers—or perhaps less attractive, so the city of Detroit can keep certain parcels for itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It's a group of properties we put together, because we cooperated with the city of Detroit…Nobody will buy this bundle, and then we can just give it to the city, and then the city will use the demolition funds to tear them down,&quot; he said. &quot;And in the bundle, we also had some good properties, which the city then sold to fund the demolition and the management of the properties they took.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;October 4th 2015 Edition&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxpN4t1C0HA?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's not only the city that benefits. In February, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Detroit News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/investigations/2019/02/12/wayne-treasurers-family-tax-foreclosed-properties/2830019002/&quot;&gt;a joint expose&lt;/a&gt; showing that Sabree's relatives purchased several homes in county-run tax foreclosure auctions. When confronted with the allegations, Sabree dismissed the rules that forbid treasurer's office employees or their family members from bidding in those auctions as &quot;intrusive and unrealistic.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sabree did not return requests for comment. But in July, an ethics board&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/07/10/ethics-board-dismisses-case-against-wayne-county-treasurer-eric-sabree&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;voted 5-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to clear him of any wrongdoing, concluding that his wife's purchase of properties in 2011 did not violate the ethics rules because the rules were adopted in 2012. Wayne County Executive Warren Evans&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/07/10/ethics-board-dismisses-case-against-wayne-county-treasurer-eric-sabree&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detroit Metro Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;that he was &quot;not sure that the Board's action today did much to address&quot; the concerns about Sabree's behavior. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Oakland County, the suburban county north of Detroit where Rafaeli's property was seized and sold in 2014, there were&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oakgov.com/treasurer/real-estate/PublishingImages/Pages/Land-Sale-Documents/October%20list%20as%20of%209.3.2019.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;86 properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;included in the county's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oakgov.com/treasurer/real-estate/Pages/Land-Sale-Documents.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2019 land auction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, held in October. In 2018, the county auctioned off 79 properties that had been seized due to unpaid taxes, according to a list obtained by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;via Michigan's freedom of information law. That's down from nearly 300 properties that went to the auction block as recently as 2015 in the same county. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County Treasurer Andrew Meisner, who is a defendant in the Rafaeli lawsuit going to the Michigan Supreme Court, did not return repeated requests for comment on this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His office says it tries to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. In a press release issued in March 2019, Meisner said his office has &quot;contacted hundreds of property tax owners to discuss their options to avoid foreclosure&quot; before the April 1 property tax payment deadline. &quot;Preventing foreclosure is in everyone's best interest,&quot; said Meisner, in the same statement. Yet the evidence clearly shows that county officials and budgets have benefited from aggressive seizures and sales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Unconstitutional Fine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Rafaeli is victorious before the Michigan Supreme Court, the next step would be to enter into negotiations with Oakland County to determine a fair market value for his lost property and he would be entitled to &quot;just compensation.&quot; And so would&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;lots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;of other Michiganders. &quot;If the Michigan Supreme Court in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rafaeli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;case…rules in favor of the property owners, counties will be required to make an appropriate refund,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://olcplc.com/public/m?1546622406&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Ellison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Legally, the matter is fraught. Counties seizing excess revenue above and beyond the amount necessary to settle the unpaid debts could be considered a taking—in which case it would be subjected to the Fifth Amendment, which promises that &quot;private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot; The Michigan Constitution offers similar protections against government taking private property without compensation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oakland County has prevailed in lower courts by arguing that the seizure of Rafaeli's property was a forfeiture. But that argument runs into other legal problems: For one, even under the wide leeway that is afforded in asset forfeiture laws, there must be an allegation of underlying criminal activity. Not paying property taxes is a civil violation, but not a criminal one.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Traditionally, civil forfeiture would only apply to the product of the crime or the proceeds of the crime,&quot; says Martin. Although many states and localities have stretched their use of civil asset forfeiture to include cases where no one is actually convicted of a crime—often as part of drug enforcement—the legal doctrine requires that the property seized must be &quot;tainted with criminal activity,&quot; she says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But if that's the way courts want to look at it, then the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines would apply. It doesn't matter that a state law, like Act 123, might authorize such a forfeiture if it is unconstitutional. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case last year,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/tag/tyson-timbs/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timbs v. Indiana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the high court ruled that the excessive fines clause applies to both state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;federal proceedings. In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timbs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the state of Indiana attempted to seize a $42,000 vehicle that had been used to transport illegal drugs, but the Supreme Court determined that taking the value of the vehicle—which was many times in excess of the allowable monetary fine for the crime Tyson Timbs had committed—violated the Eighth Amendment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That might matter for the Rafaeli case. &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tax foreclosure is not the same thing as a forfeiture,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Wesley Hottot, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm, tells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Hottot was the lead attorney in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timbs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;case. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;But even if they were right,&quot; Hottot adds,&lt;/span&gt; the forfeiture in this case violated the excessive fines clause of the U.S. Constitution, &lt;span&gt;he says, &quot;because it was grossly disproportionate to the minor offenses involved.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-8031697&quot; src=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/Michigan_Supreme_Court-1024x768.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; data-credit=&quot;Wiki Commons&quot; srcset=&quot;https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/Michigan_Supreme_Court-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/Michigan_Supreme_Court-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2019/11/Michigan_Supreme_Court-768x576.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Michigan Supreme Court
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Clerks/Documents/2018-2019/156849/156849_115_01_AC_MACT.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a brief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;submitted to the state Supreme Court defending Oakland County's use of home equity forfeiture against Rafaeli, the Michigan Association of County Treasurers makes several arguments in favor of the existing arrangement. The current system allows for counties to more easily? address blight, the group argues, despite evidence, like Paffendorf and Quicken found,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that it has made blight worse in some places. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsewhere, the group's arguments seem to contradict one another. Ruling that tax foreclosure is a taking &quot;could eliminate any incentive for property owners to pay delinquent real property taxes,&quot; the MACT argues, because the threat of punishment must exist for property owners to comply. But, later, the group argues that the seizure of an entire property to pay a smaller debt is &quot;not intended to be punitive&quot; and therefore does not run afoul of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the very least, the group's attorneys argue, the legislature—not the courts—should be responsible for fixing Act 123, because it would be able to do so &quot;without destroying the tax collection process.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At other times, county officials have pleaded poverty. &quot;They were on the verge of [bankruptcy] for quite a while. It was up to elected officials and administrators of local governments to take the initial steps (to collect taxes) and somehow they just didn't do it,&quot; Ray Wojtowicz, a retired Wayne County treasurer,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/sorry-we-foreclosed-your-home-thanks-fixing-our-budget&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;in 2017. It's clear that counties in Michigan now count on being able to pad their budgets with revenue from homes seized for having unpaid taxes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The burden of aggressive property tax enforcement, meanwhile, falls heaviest on poor communities. Wealthier homeowners have easier access to the legal and accounting assistance necessary to avoid underpayments or to quickly address any problems. Once property is seized, there's no guarantee of due process or even a court hearing. Homeowners don't even have access to public defenders; those are allocated only in criminal cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In some counties, Act 123 has &quot;created this incredibly unhealthy incentive where the county isn't just satisfied when they make enough to cover what they would have made in taxes,&quot; says Paffendorf. &quot;They are relying on these surpluses from people who are in debt.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;University of Massachusetts law professor Ralph Clifford has spent years studying home equity forfeitures in Massachusetts. The state has a less aggressive foreclosure law, but similarly allows municipalities to pocket excess revenue when tax delinquent foreclosures occur.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3086247&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;His research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;shows that an estimated $56 million is appropriated from Massachusetts taxpayers every year. After reviewing all such seizures—known as &quot;tax deed&quot; actions, under Massachusetts state law—that took place between August 2013 and July 2014, Clifford found that towns in the state collected $42.87 for every dollar in taxes owed. His analysis includes one instance in which a property assessed for a value of $24,000 was taken to cover a $26 tax bill. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;As far as I can tell,&quot; he told&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reason,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;it's all just blatantly unconstitutional.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reforming the System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We'd had these situations for decades, where people have lost their entire homes over a few hundred dollars of unpaid property taxes,&quot; Montana state Sen. Tom Jacobson (D–Great Falls) tells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;They would lose their entire homes. Forty years. All that equity. Over a few hundred bucks.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shortly after his election to the state legislature in 2012, he introduced a bill to require that property owners be compensated for what is taken—minus the debt owed and any interest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Jacobson says he was surprised by the level of opposition he witnessed. Lobbyists for counties (which handle property taxes in Montana, like in Michigan) said the bill would hurt their budgets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He reintroduced the bill during the 2015 and 2017 sessions—Montana lawmakers meet for a formal session only once every two years, though they have an interim session in off years where much of the groundwork is laid, though no votes are taken. By the third time though the process, lawmakers agreed to add additional notification requirements before a property could be seized. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This year, the state legislature passed, and Gov. Steve Bullock signed, a bill giving property owners the right to the remainder of the equity in their homes after the tax debt is settled. The bill also requires that properties cannot be sold for less than 50 percent of their assessed value—an important caveat that should prevent some of what has occurred in Michigan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reforms also flip the counties' incentives. Instead of being able to profit off delinquent taxes, says Jacobson, officials will now have an incentive to make sure the taxes are paid up front and on time—or they'll have an incentive to help taxpayers find ways to meet their obligations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Penalty More than 8,000 Times the Underlying Debt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

In Michigan, however, the practice of seizing homes over tiny underpayments of property taxes is likely to remain in place unless the courts step in. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2019-2020/billintroduced/House/pdf/2019-HIB-4219.pdf&quot;&gt;A bill&lt;/a&gt; introduced in the Michigan state House by Rep. Gary Howell (R–Lapeer) to reform Act 123 collected a handful of co-sponsors this year but did not receive even a committee vote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which means there will be more people like Uri Rafeali, who lost a home over an $8.41 mistake. His property, bought as an investment, is valued at an estimated $136,000. The penalty imposed by Oakland County was more than 8,000 percent greater than the underlying debt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But today, while the legal battle over its fate plays out, the house sits empty. It generates no tax revenue for the city or county. It earns no money for Rafaeli or his wife in their retirement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The Constitution was written to prevent the government from violating a right that preexists the Constitution,&quot; says Martin. &quot;If this can happen to multimillionaires and to the poor, to the elderly….If this can happen to Mr. Rafaeli, it can happen to anyone.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2019-11-06 3:50PM Pacific:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/update-to-the-intel-xeon-platinum-9282-gromacs-benchmarks-piece/&quot;&gt;Update to the Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 GROMACS Benchmarks Piece&lt;/a&gt; – Please Read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today something happened that many may not have seen. Intel published a set of benchmarks showing its advantage of a dual Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 system versus the AMD EPYC 7742. Vendors present benchmarks to show that their products are good from time-to-time. There is one difference in this case: we checked Intel’s work and found that they presented a number to intentionally mislead would-be buyers as to the company’s relative performance versus AMD.&lt;span id=&quot;more-38737&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, even through the 2017 introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-scalable-processor-family-skylake-sp-coverage-central/&quot;&gt;Skylake Xeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7000-series-sku-lists-for-launch/&quot;&gt;Naples EPYC&lt;/a&gt; parts, on the server side, the company has been relatively good about getting a balanced view. In late 2018, the company brought on a new team, allegedly to look over the performance benchmarks the company produced. That has culminated in the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/performance-at-intel&quot;&gt;Performance at Intel&lt;/a&gt;” Medium blog. This is described as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Intel’s blog to share timely and candid information specific to the performance of Intel technologies and products.&lt;/em&gt;” In only its seventh post, it has betrayed that motto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the post in question. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/performance-at-intel/hpc-leadership-where-it-matters-real-world-performance-b16c47b11a01&quot;&gt;HPC Leadership Where it Matters — Real-World Performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, I know and personally like the Intel performance labs folks as well as the folks on their new performance strategy team. This is just a gaffe that needed to be pointed out since, in theory, Intel has taken to do more diligence now than when they were doing a good job in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Misleading with Benchmarks and Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, here is a chart Intel produced as part of the story to show that it has superior performance to AMD, and we are going to highlight one of the results, the GROMACS result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-performance-strategy-team-publishing-intentionally-misleading-benchmarks/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-benchmarks-compared-to-epyc-7742-form-intel/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-38738&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-38738&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-Benchmarks-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 Benchmarks Compared To EPYC 7742 Form Intel&quot; width=&quot;1298&quot; height=&quot;729&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-Benchmarks-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel.jpg 1298w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-Benchmarks-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-Benchmarks-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-Benchmarks-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel-696x391.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-Benchmarks-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel-1068x600.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-Benchmarks-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel-748x420.jpg 748w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1298px) 100vw, 1298px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 Benchmarks Compared To EPYC 7742 From Intel
&lt;p&gt;The reason we highlighted this result is because it looked off to us. A 400W 56 core part seemed a bit strange that is was 20% faster here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footnote on configuration details we followed eventually leading us to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/benchmarks/2019-xeon-scalable-benchmark.html&quot;&gt;referenced #31&lt;/a&gt; corresponding to this result. Here is the configuration for the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GROMACS 2019.3: Geomean (5 workloads: archer2_small, ion_channel_pme, lignocellulose_rf, water_pme, water_rf):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel® Xeon® Platinum 9282 processor: Intel® Compiler 2019u4, Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL) 2019u4, Intel MPI 2019u4, AVX-512 build, BIOS: HT ON, Turbo OFF, SNC OFF, 2 threads per core;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD EPYC™ 7742: Intel® Compiler 2019u4, Intel® MKL 2019u4, Intel MPI 2019u4, AVX2 build, BIOS: SMT ON, Boost ON, NPS 4, 1 threads per core. (&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/benchmarks/2019-xeon-scalable-benchmark.html&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We split the paragraph on the source page into three lines and will discuss the first, followed by the last two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using a Zen 2 Disadvantaged GROMACS Version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line is damning. Intel used GROMACS 2019.3. To be fair, they used the same version which makes it a valid test. GROMACS 2019.3 was released on &lt;a href=&quot;http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019.3/release-notes/2019/2019.3.html&quot;&gt;June 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;, just after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/2nd-gen-intel-xeon-scalable-launch-cascade-lake-details-and-analysis/&quot;&gt;2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable&lt;/a&gt; series. On October 2, 2019 the GROMACS team released GROMACS 2019.4. Keep in mind that it is over a month before Intel published its article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://manual.gromacs.org/current/release-notes/2019/2019.4.html&quot;&gt;GROMACS 2019.4&lt;/a&gt;, there was a small, but very important fix for the comparison Intel was trying to show aptly called: &lt;a href=&quot;http://manual.gromacs.org/current/release-notes/2019/2019.4.html#added-amd-zen-2-detection&quot;&gt;Added AMD Zen 2 detection&lt;/a&gt;. Which says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AMD Zen 2 architecture is now detected as different from Zen 1 and uses 256-bit wide AVX2 SIMD instructions (GMX_SIMD=AVX2_256) by default. Also the non-bonded kernel parameters have been tuned for Zen 2. This has a significant impact on performance. (&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://manual.gromacs.org/current/release-notes/2019/2019.4.html#added-amd-zen-2-detection&quot;&gt;GROMACS Manual&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the industry, it is or should have been well known that older versions of GROMACS were not properly supporting the new “Rome” EPYC architecture. We cited this specifically in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/8/&quot;&gt;launch piece&lt;/a&gt; since we found the issue. We even specifically call it out on every EPYC 7002 v. Xeon chart we have produced for GROMACS since the results did not meet expectations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/amd-epyc-7002-gromacs-sth-small-case-not-zen2-optimized-benchmark/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-36670&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-36670&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-GROMACS-STH-Small-Case-Not-Zen2-Optimized-Benchmark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AMD EPYC 7002 GROMACS STH Small Case Not Zen2 Optimized Benchmark&quot; width=&quot;856&quot; height=&quot;584&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-GROMACS-STH-Small-Case-Not-Zen2-Optimized-Benchmark.jpg 856w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-GROMACS-STH-Small-Case-Not-Zen2-Optimized-Benchmark-400x273.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-GROMACS-STH-Small-Case-Not-Zen2-Optimized-Benchmark-800x546.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-GROMACS-STH-Small-Case-Not-Zen2-Optimized-Benchmark-218x150.jpg 218w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-GROMACS-STH-Small-Case-Not-Zen2-Optimized-Benchmark-696x475.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-GROMACS-STH-Small-Case-Not-Zen2-Optimized-Benchmark-616x420.jpg 616w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AMD EPYC 7002 GROMACS STH Small Case Not Zen2 Optimized Benchmark
&lt;p&gt;That is just one of our test cases which is considered a “small” case which is frankly too small for the size of these nodes. Still, the data was very easy to spot something was awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Intel perhaps did not know, is that we also had one of the lead developers on GROMACS, a popular HPC tool, on our dual AMD EPYC 7002 system to address some of the very basic optimizations for the 2019.4 release. I believe there may be more coming, but this is one where we found the lack of optimization, and actually helped ever so slightly in getting it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Intel using the post-2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable version of GROMACS but the pre-AMD EPYC 7002 series which had been out for over a month, Intel’s numbers are highly skewed for the Platinum 9282 which only has a 20% lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, technically this was a valid test by using the same version. On the other hand, Intel specifically used a version that was prior to the package getting any AMD Zen 2 optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test Configuration Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to the test configuration lines for Intel and AMD, here are the lines in table form for easier comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-performance-strategy-team-publishing-intentionally-misleading-benchmarks/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-gromacs-config-compared-to-epyc-7742-form-intel/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-38740&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-38740&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-GROMACS-Config-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 GROMACS Config Compared To EPYC 7742 Form Intel&quot; width=&quot;523&quot; height=&quot;226&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-GROMACS-Config-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel.jpg 523w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-GROMACS-Config-Compared-to-EPYC-7742-form-Intel-400x173.jpg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 GROMACS Config Compared To EPYC 7742 From Intel
&lt;p&gt;Intel used its compiler, MKL, and MPI for this test. In the 2017 era, Intel tested Xeon and EPYC with a variety of compilers and picked the best one. We are going to give their lab team that runs the tests the benefit of the doubt here that Intel’s compiler and MKL/ MPI implementation yield the best results. Indeed, it is better that AMD does well than Arm for Intel since a customer staying on x86 is a much easier TAM to fight back against in 2021 for Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AVX status we addressed in the section above. Using AVX2 on GROMACS 2019.3 would have disadvantaged the AMD EPYC parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both CPUs we see that there are two threads per CPU which means 56 cores/ 112 threads on the Platinum 9282 and 64 cores/ 128 threads on two AMD EPYC 7742 CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then things change. Turbo was enabled on the EPYC 7742, but not on the Xeon Platinum 9282. In GROMACS, transitions in and out of AVX-512 code can lead to differences in boost clocks which can impact performance. We are just going to point out the delta here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNC is off for Intel but NPS=4 is set for AMD. Sub-NUMA clustering allows for each memory controller to be split into two domains. On a standard Xeon die, that means two NUMA nodes per CPU. Assuming it works the same on the dual-die Platinum 9282, it would be four NUMA nodes per package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/the-new-intel-mesh-interconnect-architecture-and-platform-implications/intel-skylake-sp-mesh-interconnect-sub-numa-clustering-snc/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-23325&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-23325&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Intel-Skylake-SP-Mesh-Interconnect-Sub-NUMA-Clustering-SNC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel Skylake SP Mesh Interconnect Sub NUMA Clustering SNC&quot; width=&quot;1318&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Intel-Skylake-SP-Mesh-Interconnect-Sub-NUMA-Clustering-SNC.jpg 1318w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Intel-Skylake-SP-Mesh-Interconnect-Sub-NUMA-Clustering-SNC-400x181.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Intel-Skylake-SP-Mesh-Interconnect-Sub-NUMA-Clustering-SNC-800x362.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Intel-Skylake-SP-Mesh-Interconnect-Sub-NUMA-Clustering-SNC-696x315.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Intel-Skylake-SP-Mesh-Interconnect-Sub-NUMA-Clustering-SNC-1068x484.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Intel-Skylake-SP-Mesh-Interconnect-Sub-NUMA-Clustering-SNC-927x420.jpg 927w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1318px) 100vw, 1318px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intel Skylake SP Mesh Interconnect Sub NUMA Clustering SNC
&lt;p&gt;The AMD EPYC NPS setting is very similar as it allows one to go from one NUMA node per socket and instead select two or four. Here, Intel is running four NUMA nodes per socket, or eight total for the dual AMD EPYC 7742 system versus only two NUMA nodes per socket or four total on the Platinum 9282 system. SNC/ NPS usually increases memory bandwidth to cores by localizing memory access. What is slightly interesting here is how Intel characterizes GROMACS as being compute versus-memory bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, threads per core. On the Intel platform, it is 2. On AMD, it is 1. That means Intel is using 224 threads on 112 cores for the Xeon Platinum 9282 and 128 threads on 128 cores with 256 threads on the system. Putting the translation of configuration words into a table this is what Intel did with the test configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-performance-strategy-team-publishing-intentionally-misleading-benchmarks/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-v-epyc-7742-gromacs-thread-usage-from-intel/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-38742&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-38742&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-v-EPYC-7742-GROMACS-Thread-Usage-from-Intel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 V EPYC 7742 GROMACS Thread Usage From Intel&quot; width=&quot;571&quot; height=&quot;126&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-v-EPYC-7742-GROMACS-Thread-Usage-from-Intel.jpg 571w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intel-Xeon-Platinum-9282-v-EPYC-7742-GROMACS-Thread-Usage-from-Intel-400x88.jpg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intel Xeon Platinum 9282 V EPYC 7742 GROMACS Thread Usage From Intel
&lt;p&gt;What we do not know is whether Intel needed to do this due to problem sizes. GROMACS can error out if you have too many threads which is why we have a STH Small Case that will not run on many 4P systems and is struggling, as shown above, on even the dual EPYC 7742 system. It does require very solid thread pinning in this scenario of one GROMACS thread on a two-thread core otherwise performance can go poorly quickly with this configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even assuming that Intel software tooling is superior, Intel changed the boost setting, added more NUMA nodes for AMD, and used fewer threads per core than with Intel. Perhaps that is how Intel got the best results using an older version of GROMACS, but that is a fair number of changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interesting Test Configuration Points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other, very interesting points here is that Intel tested on a Naples generation test platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Intel configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel® Xeon® Platinum 9282 processor configuration: Intel “Walker Pass” S9200WKL platform with 2-socket Intel® Xeon® Platinum 9282 processors (2.6GHz, 56C), 24x16GB DDR4-2933, 1 SSD, BIOS: SE5C620.86B.2X.01.0053, Microcode: 0x5000029, Red Hat Enterprise Linux* 7.7, kernel 3.10.0-1062.1.1. (&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/benchmarks/2019-xeon-scalable-benchmark.html&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the AMD EPYC configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD EPYC™ 7742 processor configuration: Supermicro AS-2023-TR4 (HD11DSU-iN) with 2-socket AMD EPYC™ 7742 “Rome” processors (2.25GHz, 64C), 16x32GB DDR4-3200, 1 SSD, BIOS: 2.0 CPLD 02.B1.01, Microcode: 830101C, CentOS* Linux release 7.7.1908, kernel 3.10.0-1062.1.1.el7.crt1.x86_64. (&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/benchmarks/2019-xeon-scalable-benchmark.html&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel is using 16GB DIMMs versus 32GB DIMMs for EPYC. They have different numbers of memory channels so we can let that pass. One item was very interesting, the test server. Intel used its S9200WKL which we covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-platinum-9200-formerly-cascade-lake-ap-launched/&quot;&gt;Intel Xeon Platinum 9200 Formerly Cascade Lake-AP Launched&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-platinum-9200-formerly-cascade-lake-ap-launched/intel-server-system-9200wk-overview/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-33867&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-33867&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Intel-Server-System-9200WK-Overview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel Server System 9200WK Overview&quot; width=&quot;998&quot; height=&quot;523&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Intel-Server-System-9200WK-Overview.jpg 998w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Intel-Server-System-9200WK-Overview-400x210.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Intel-Server-System-9200WK-Overview-800x419.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Intel-Server-System-9200WK-Overview-696x365.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Intel-Server-System-9200WK-Overview-801x420.jpg 801w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Intel Server System 9200WK Overview
&lt;p&gt;What is more interesting is the AMD EPYC 7742 configuration. Here, Intel is using the Supermicro AS-2023-TR4 that it shows is built upon the Supermicro HD11DSU-iN which is similar to the motherboard we reviewed in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-as-1123us-tr4-server-review-1u-dual-amd-epyc/&quot;&gt;Supermicro AS-1123US-TR4 Server Review&lt;/a&gt; server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/supermicro-as-1123us-tr4-server-review-1u-dual-amd-epyc/supermicro-as-1123us-tr4-airflow/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-28119&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-28119&quot; src=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Supermicro-AS-1123US-TR4-Airflow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Supermicro AS 1123US TR4 Airflow&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;501&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Supermicro-AS-1123US-TR4-Airflow.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Supermicro-AS-1123US-TR4-Airflow-400x251.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Supermicro-AS-1123US-TR4-Airflow-696x436.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Supermicro-AS-1123US-TR4-Airflow-671x420.jpg 671w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Supermicro AS 1123US TR4 Airflow
&lt;p&gt;Most likely, it has to be a Revision 2.0 motherboard to support the EPYC 7002 generation and DDR4-3200 speeds. Being a H11 platform, it will only support PCIe Gen3, not Gen4. Again, this is an off-the-shelf configurable system that the socketed EPYC 7742 allows for versus the Intel-only Platinum 9200 solution. We explained why that is an extraordinarily important nuance in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-platinum-9200-series-lacks-mainstream-support/&quot;&gt;Why the Intel Xeon Platinum 9200 Series Lacks Mainstream Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base cTDP of the EPYC 7742 is 225W as Intel notes in its article. Technically, the Supermicro server using a Rev 2.0 board is capable of running the AMD EPYC 7742 series at a cTDP of 240W. If someone was to compare, on a socket-to-socket basis, an EPYC 7742 to a 400W Platinum 9282, one may expect that pushing the cTDP up to 240W would be a common setting. Of note, in our testing, even with a cTDP of 240W the power consumption to TDP ratio for EPYC 7742 chips is much closer than the Platinum 8280’s AVX-512 power consumption to TDP ratio is. Extrapolating, there is a 100% chance that the EPYC 7742 is using considerably less power here to the point that cTDP should have been set to 240W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main article’s text, Intel states 225W for the part and cTDP was not mentioned in the #31 configuration details. We are also going to note that there is a 280W &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7h12-64-cores-and-even-faster-new-supermicro-gpu-servers/&quot;&gt;AMD EPYC 7H12&lt;/a&gt; part available, but it is unlikely Intel had access to this for internal lab testing at this point (STH has not been able to get a pair either.) That would have at least been a somewhat better comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Intel is using a 3.10.0-1062.1.1 CentOS/ RHEL kernel. Newer Linux kernels tend to perform better with the newer EPYC chips but it is valid that Intel is being consistent even if it potentially disadvantages AMD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was around 1800 words on a single benchmark that Intel presented. Should the text leave any doubt, personally I tend to give the benefit of the doubt to the folks in Intel’s performance labs since they did a fairly good job in the 2017 era. However, now those folks have a performance strategy team sitting above them that is publishing articles like this that have misses that a reasonably prudent performance arbiter should see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can only conclude that Intel’s “Performance at Intel” blog is not a reputable attempt to present factual information. It is simply a way for Intel to publish misinformation to the market in the hope that people do not do the diligence to see what is backing the claims. Once one does the diligence, things fall apart quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Intel documented their procedures means that they had valid tests. It is just that the tests presented, and validated by the Performance at Intel team were clearly conducted in a way to misinform a potential customer about the current state of performance. This GROMACS example has been publicly known for almost four months and has not been current state for over a month. AMD does the same things as part of marketing e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-rome-namd-intel-xeon-computex-2019/&quot;&gt;AMD EPYC Rome NAMD and the Intel Xeon Response at Computex 2019&lt;/a&gt; so it is, perhaps, par for the course. So perhaps the best course of action is to ignore these claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was once told to me, “you only lose your reputation once in the valley.” With this, the “Performance at Intel” blog just had that moment. Perhaps in marketing, one gets multiple attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber’s self-driving car could not detect pedestrians outside of a crosswalk</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/06/uber_self_driving_car_death/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/06/uber_self_driving_car_death/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The self-driving Uber car that hit and killed a woman walking her bike across a street wasn’t designed to detect “jaywalking pedestrians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's according to an official dossier published by the US National Safety Transportation Board (NTSB) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March 2018 accident was &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/19/uber_self_driving_car_fatal_crash/&quot;&gt;the first recorded death&lt;/a&gt; by a fully autonomous vehicle. On-board video footage showed the victim, 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, pushing her bike at night across a road in Tempe, Arizona, moments before she was struck by the AI-powered SUV at 39 MPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, an investigation by the NTSB into the crash has pinpointed a likely major contributing factor: the code couldn't recognize her as a pedestrian, because she was not at an obvious designated crossing. Rather than correctly anticipating her movements as a person moving across the road, it ended up running right into her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The system design did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians,” the watchdog &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/document.cfm?docID=477717&amp;amp;docketID=62978&amp;amp;mkey=96894&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://dms.ntsb.gov/public/62500-62999/62978/629713.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;] in its write-up. “Instead, the system had initially classified her as an 'other' object which are not assigned goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer-vision systems in self-driving cars are trained to identify things, such as other vehicles, trees, sign posts, bicycles, and so on, and make decisions on what to do next using that information. It appears Uber’s software wasn’t able to identify Herzberg since there was no classification label for a person not using a proper crossing point, and it wasn't able to make the right decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Countdown to impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 5.6 seconds before hitting her, the car's radar detected Herzberg, and at 5.2 seconds, she was picked out by the Lidar. However, the machine-learning system more or less ignored her, figuring her to be a non-moving object not in the vehicle's way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the robo-vehicle drew nearer, it categorized her variously as a vehicle, a bike, or some other thing that was not, or was only partially, in its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just 1.2 seconds before hitting her, it identified her not only as a bicycle but also clearly in the path of its travel, by which point it was far too late to change course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the software was &quot;unable to correctly predict the path&quot; of Herzberg, the report noted. Perhaps if it had correctly identified her early on as a person crossing the street, it could have dramatically slowed down or otherwise tried to avoid her. But it did not anticipate the collision because, for the most part, it considered her to be some unknown object not in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, don't forget: the SUV's emergency braking system was &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/24/uber_self_driving_software_crash_report/&quot;&gt;deliberately disabled&lt;/a&gt; because when it was switched on, the vehicle would act erratically, according to Uber. The software biz previously said “the vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action,&quot; in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-driving car was fully autonomous at the time at the accident, though it had a human driver at the wheel. An internal camera &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cuo8eq9C3Ec&quot;&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; the Uber worker looking down and away from the road moments before the accident, unaware of Herzberg’s presence before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a timetable, produced by the NTSB, detailing the car's decision-making and speed in the seconds before the accident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;CaptionedImage width_85&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/11/06/handout_ntsb_uber_table_1_top.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/11/06/handout_ntsb_uber_table_1_top.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NTSB table of events in Uber crash&quot; title=&quot;NTSB table of events in Uber crash&quot; height=&quot;688&quot; width=&quot;628&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;CaptionedImage width_85&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/11/06/handout_ntsb_uber_table_1_bottom.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/11/06/handout_ntsb_uber_table_1_bottom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NTSB table of events in Uber crash&quot; title=&quot;NTSB table of events in Uber crash&quot; height=&quot;782&quot; width=&quot;630&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report comes just two weeks before the board is due to hold a public meeting to “determine the probable cause of a crash involving a pedestrian and an Uber test vehicle,” on 19 November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety board also released &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://go.usa.gov/xpTvX&quot;&gt;more than 40 documents&lt;/a&gt; totaling at least 430 pages with various bits of supporting evidence and comprehensive accounts into things like the vehicle’s properties and the internal safety culture at Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive data dump also revealed that the ride-hailing biz's self-driving cars were involved in 37 smashes between September 2016 and March 2018, prior to the deadly accident. In these 37 incidents, all of the robo-vehicles were driving in autonomous mode, and in 33 of these cases, other vehicles crashed into the self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Tragedy'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday evening, a spokesperson for Uber told us: “We regret the March 2018 crash involving one of our self-driving vehicles that took Elaine Herzberg’s life. In the wake of this tragedy, the team at Uber Advanced Technologies Group has adopted critical program improvements to further prioritize safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We deeply value the thoroughness of the NTSB’s investigation into the crash and look forward to reviewing their recommendations once issued after the NTSB’s board meeting later this month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Reg&lt;/em&gt; asked Uber how it planned to train its autonomous vehicles to detect jaywalkers in future, and the biz told us: &quot;We conduct hundreds of tests in simulation and on our test track to help us improve the overall safety of our system. These tests include taking our software and having it go through scenarios that involve complex situations like jaywalking, hard braking, and unprotected turns.&quot; ®&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DNA database that found Golden State Killer is potential national security leak</title>
<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614642/dna-database-gedmatch-golden-state-killer-security-risk-hack/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614642/dna-database-gedmatch-golden-state-killer-security-risk-hack/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;A private DNA ancestry database that’s been used by police to catch criminals is a security risk from which a nation-state could steal DNA data on a million Americans, according to security researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Security flaws in the service, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gedmatch.com/login1.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GEDmatch&lt;/a&gt;, not only risk exposing people’s genetic health information but could let an adversary such as China or Russia create a powerful biometric database useful for identifying nearly any American from a DNA sample.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;GEDMatch, which crowdsources DNA profiles, was created by genealogy enthusiasts to let people search for relatives and is run entirely by volunteers. It shows how a trend toward sharing DNA data online can create privacy risks affecting everyone, even people who don’t choose to share their own information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;“You can replace your credit card number, but you can’t replace your genome,” says Peter Ney, a postdoctoral researcher in computer science at the University of Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Ney, along with professors and DNA security researchers Luis Ceze and Tadayoshi Kohno, described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnasec.cs.washington.edu/genetic-genealogy/ney_ndss.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; posted online how they developed and tested a novel attack employing DNA data they uploaded to GEDmatch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Using specially designed DNA profiles, they say, they were able to run searches that let them guess more than 90% of the DNA data of other users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;The founder of GEDmatch, Curtis Rogers, confirmed that the researchers alerted him to the threat during the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;“We certainly are concerned about privacy also, and it’s good that studies like this are done,” says Rogers. “But no matter what you do, there will always be some potential for privacy invasion when you are doing genealogy. Genealogy is a procedure in which you want to compare your information to other people’s.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Razib Khan, a genomics researcher who is head of scientific content at Insitome, a service that interprets DNA for consumers, called the new security research a large-scale demonstration of weaknesses already known to enthusiasts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Khan says he has been aware of efforts to “scrape” GEDmatch, or collect more data than usual, and believes a larger attack to whisk away much of the data could already have occurred. “My guess is that almost certainly it’s already been done,” he says. “Governments are collecting data on people. You never know what they can use it for.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Asked if there was evidence the database had already faced concerted attacks, scraping, or scanning, Rogers said, “I don’t want to get into it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;“Not that I am aware of,” he added. “I don’t know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Rogers declined to comment on whether he’d been approached by national security officials about the site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdsourcing DNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Rogers started the genealogy service as a way for people to upload DNA test results from services like 23andMe and locate relatives among other users, by comparing their DNA. The crowdsourced database now holds 1.3 million profiles, he says, although some of these are duplicates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;As the site grew, it drew the attention of police investigators. In 2017, police in California announced they had used the database, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611038/investigators-searched-a-million-peoples-dna-to-find-golden-state-serial-killer/&quot;&gt;without Rogers' knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, to help identify a murderer known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/f/611033/the-golden-state-killer-was-found-via-dna-genealogy-and-he-wont-be-the-last/&quot;&gt;Golden State Killer&lt;/a&gt;. Police did it by uploading DNA data extracted from crime-scene evidence and comparing it with users’ data to identify some of his relatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Since then, dozens of murderers and rapists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611529/the-citizen-scientist-who-finds-killers-from-her-couch/&quot;&gt;have been identified&lt;/a&gt; using GEDmatch. But a privacy debate erupted as well, partly because police had searched users’ DNA without their knowledge. In response, Rogers allowed users to opt in or out of police searches, or just delete their profiles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;But there was an even broader concern: if a DNA database is large enough, practically everyone can now be tracked though their relatives, even if they never took a DNA test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;With the million or so profiles in the database, most Americans have second or third cousins in it, says Doc Edge, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who last week posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcbias.org/2019/10/22/paper-faq-for-attacks-on-genetic-privacy-via-uploads-to-genealogical-databases/&quot;&gt;the first paper&lt;/a&gt; showing how ancestry databases could be vulnerable to a clever searcher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Now the team at the University of Washington has demonstrated a new attack specifically on GEDmatch that is “much stronger,” according to Yaniv Erlich, chief scientist of MyHeritage, another DNA genealogy company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;The researchers exploited the way GEDmatch’s genetic comparison engine works in order to infer the DNA data of other people. “These researchers went in through the main gates—they did not break in,” says Erlich. ”Here we have a method that is not even illegal as far as we know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;When a user searches for relatives, the program compares thousands of DNA markers (called SNPs) from the user’s genome to those of others in the database. The better the match, the more closely that person is related to you. A parent and child will share half their DNA, for example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;To test his hack, Ney uploaded specially designed “attack” DNA files, which he then compared with target profiles he also created. He found that with a dozen attack files he could infer the nearly all the actual DNA markers of the target profile, even though these are meant to be private.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National security risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;The same attack wouldn’t work on other genealogy sites, like 23andMe, because they don’t permit data uploads. Others, like MyHeritage, do allow uploads but don’t give users as much information about their matches. “The problem with GEDmatch is the browser is too good, and searches too deeply,” says Erlich. “If I were them, I would remove it, fix it, then put it back.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;According to Erlich, the vulnerability has national security implications. If a foreign counterintelligence agency grabbed a million American DNA profiles, that country could use genetic genealogy to identify the true identity of American spies or diplomats, locate their relatives, or discover genetic &lt;em&gt;kompromat&lt;/em&gt; like unacknowledged children. Since other countries don’t have such databases for the US to steal, the risk would not be symmetric.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;“You could have a capability which is better than what the FBI currently has, and you can use it in any way that you want,” says Erlich. “With the raw data you could come up with even better algorithms. You can identify spies or do genetic surveillance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;As well, says Ney, fraudsters could create fake accounts and pretend to be someone’s long-lost relative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Ney says he told GEDmatch of the vulnerabilities in July but is not convinced the tiny company is capable of repairing the problems. Initially, his team gave it a deadline of September to fix the problems, but Ney says he held off posting his report for more than a month when he noticed the site hadn’t been fixed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;“Then, a month ago, they did make a small change to their algorithm that prevents the most significant attack we developed,” says Ney. “Our question is whether those fixes are robust to a determined adversary. It might be a temporary patch.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;GEDMatch, run out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/science/gedmatch-genealogy-cold-cases.html&quot;&gt;a house in Lake Worth, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, is small business whose aim is genealogy and education, not profits, says Rogers. He acknowledged that its team of five part-time volunteers would not have the resources to hire security consultants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Rogers, who is not a computer programmer, did not offer details about what fixes GEDmatch had implemented. “I let the technical people work on it, and I believe they have,” he said in an interview. He later emailed to say the site was “actively working to add more security measures based on the reported problems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Ney says he does not believe the genealogy site is secure. “How much effort does it take to secure a large website with a million-plus in genetic data? I think it’s hard for anyone to do,” he says. “The question I have is whether a volunteer-run effort is capable of having the manpower to handle it.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;Ney also doesn’t believe administrators at GEDmatch have any way of knowing whether or not the trove of DNA data has already been carried off by an attacker, since an attack could look like an ordinary search for relatives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;jsx-671803276&quot;&gt;“They are in a situation of being ignorant, which is its own problem,” says Ney. “The worst kind of attack is where you don’t even know it happened.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Censorship is bad even when it’s done by private companies</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://necpluribusimpar.net/censorship-is-bad-even-when-its-done-by-private-companies/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This post is a slightly longer version of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefederalist.com/2019/11/01/why-private-big-tech-bias-is-just-as-bad-as-government-censorship/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; I recently published on The Federalist. Their editor asked me to cut some passages because it was a bit long, but I figured that readers of my blog would prefer the director’s cut, so here is the full version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years, conservatives have expressed concern that big tech companies, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, are suppressing right-leaning content in various, more or less direct ways. Even though conservatives often exaggerate it, I think there is no doubt about the anti-conservative bias of these companies, but that is not what I want to discuss in this article. Rather, I want to argue that, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; big tech companies are biased against some ideas and are suppressing content on ideological grounds, then it’s bad even though they are non-state actors. In fact, the claim I want to make is even weaker, it’s that anyone who would worry about this kind of bias on the part of the state should also worry about it when it comes from big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very weak claim, which I think should be largely uncontroversial, but many people deny it, including some conservatives and many libertarians. In particular, it doesn’t imply that big tech companies should be regulated by the government, which requires a separate argument. Indeed, as conservatives often point out, the existence of a market imperfection doesn’t mean that government intervention is justified, if only because it may actually make the problem worse. But as many people don’t seem to understand, especially among libertarians, the fact that government intervention is not warranted doesn’t mean there is no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a vague claim that, in order to be acted upon, would have to be made more precise. What I claim should be uncontroversial is that, if you think it would be bad if the government were ideologically biased and suppressed content for ideological reasons, you should also think it’s bad if big tech companies do it. But this leaves a lot of room for rational disagreement about what constitutes bias and what counts as suppressing content for ideological reasons. In particular, the issue of fairness in algorithms is very complicated, so reasonable people disagree about what a fair algorithm is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I don’t need to resolve this question here, it’s enough for the point I want to make that,  among the people who defend big tech companies by saying that, even if the accusations of bias are true, it’s not a problem, most would protest if the government did what those companies allegedly do. Again, what I’m attacking is the idea that censorship is only bad if it comes from the government, but that as long as it’s done by private companies, there is nothing to see. This is a ridiculous idea that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and, whatever your view about what constitutes bias in algorithms and whether big tech companies should be regulated, you should acknowledge that. I know that some people, especially among libertarians, think it makes them smart to believe that, but they clearly have not thought this through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to oppose state censorship, but the people who argue that it’s okay for big tech companies to suppress content for ideological reasons on their platforms oppose it on the ground that it prevents the marketplace of ideas, which they believe maximizes the probability that people will discover the truth and settle on it through rational debate, from working as it’s supposed to. The problem is that, if that’s why you oppose state censorship, and to be clear I think it’s a good reason to oppose it, there is nothing about the state that makes censorship bad when it originates from the government but unproblematic as long as it comes from private companies. Indeed, while it’s true that the government can distort the marketplace of ideas, so can private companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if Google makes it harder to find right-wing content, it stacks the deck in favor of the left, because people are more likely to be only exposed to left-wing content. Similarly, if Twitter hides content by conservatives and/or promotes content by liberals, the former are less likely to be heard. Big tech companies don’t even have to completely suppress right-wing content to distort the marketplace of ideas. Even a pro-liberal/anti-conservative bias that comes way short of the systematic suppression of right-wing content would introduce a distortion. Of course, as long as big tech companies are biased in the relevant way, it doesn’t matter which ideologies are penalized by it, it will distort the marketplace of ideas all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who defend big tech companies argue that it’s not the same on the ground that if people are unhappy about what those companies do, they can always stop using them and use other platforms instead, whereas people can’t opt out of the government. If the state bans the expression of certain views and you express them anyway, it can use violence to compel you to stop and imprison you, but Google or Twitter can’t do that. However, since the companies in question are &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; monopolies, it’s not actually true that if you’re unhappy with big tech companies you can just use another platform. Moreover, even if it &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; true, it would be irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it’s not always true that, if you’re unhappy with big tech companies, you can always stop using it and use another platform instead. For instance, if you’re a journalist and you want to promote your work, there is simply no viable alternative to Twitter at the moment. No other microblogging platform comes even close to having the number of users Twitter does, and most of the alternatives are hotbeds of extremism, so that anyone who joins them is thereby disqualified in polite company. People who reply that, if Twitter were so bad, a viable alternative would have emerged are just missing the point. Of course, it’s possible that, if Twitter’s behavior were &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; egregious, it would lose its dominant position to other platforms, but its monopoly power means that it can get away with a lot without endangering that position. Again, for bias to distort the marketplace of ideas, it isn’t necessary that Twitter &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; suppress certain viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even when there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; viable alternatives, as long as the vast majority of people are not using them, their existence is completely irrelevant to the argument against censorship by big tech companies. For instance, there are several alternatives to Google, but it doesn’t change the fact that more than 90% of online searches are made on Google. Thus, if Google’s search results are ideologically biased, the marketplace of ideas &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be distorted. The fact that people could use another search engine, while absolutely true, is neither here nor there. The argument that censorship is bad because it distorts the marketplace of ideas has nothing to do with personal responsibility. Even if people could easily opt out of the government, as long as most people don’t, state censorship is still bad, because it still distorts the marketplace of ideas. Beside, people may not even be aware that they are being manipulated, so pointing out what people could do if they were is largely beside the point anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some even go further and claim that, even if big tech companies are somewhat biased against conservatives and penalize their content to some extent, they should be &lt;em&gt;grateful&lt;/em&gt; to them, on the ground that without platforms such as YouTube they wouldn’t be able to reach as many people. This  last part is probably true, but the argument is still ridiculous. Suppose that your electricity company, which has a monopoly in your area, charged Democrats more than Republicans. I don’t think that, in this situation, anyone would say that Democrats would be ungrateful to complain, on the ground that without that company they wouldn’t even have the electricity. It doesn’t matter that, thanks to big tech companies, conservatives can reach more people. As long as they are biased against them and penalize their content, it will still distort the marketplace of ideas in favor of the left and this is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that, while the people who defend big tech companies in that way usually see themselves as part of the classical liberal tradition, the great authors in that tradition have all insisted that government was not the only or even the main threat to freedom. The obsession with the treat posed to freedom by state power, to the exclusion of almost everything else, is something that is only found among contemporary libertarians but that was foreign to the thinkers they claim as their intellectual forebears. And despite what they might say, it can’t just be explained by the fact that state power has grown immensely since the 19th century, if only because so has the power of corporations. Unfortunately, judging from what they say, most of the people who say that censorship by private companies is unproblematic have never read the authors who founded the tradition they claim as their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, John Stuart Mill, who is arguably the most famous thinker in the liberal tradition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Liberty/Chapter_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;On Liberty&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and is still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of the public authorities. But reflecting persons perceived that when society is itself the tyrant—society collectively, over the separate individuals who compose it—its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own. There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs, as protection against political despotism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is but one of many passages in this book, published in 1859, where Mill insists on the dangers that non-state actors pose to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Democracy in America&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1835, Tocqueville had already &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/tocqueville/alexis/democracy/complete.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt; a similar concern for the threat to freedom of thought non-state actors could pose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If great writers have not at present existed in America, the reason is very simply given in these facts; there can be no literary genius without freedom of opinion, and freedom of opinion does not exist in America. The Inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number of anti-religious books from circulating in Spain. The empire of the majority succeeds much better in the United States, since it actually removes the wish of publishing them. Unbelievers are to be met with in America, but, to say the truth, there is no public organ of infidelity. Attempts have been made by some governments to protect the morality of nations by prohibiting licentious books. In the United States no one is punished for this sort of works, but no one is induced to write them; not because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but because the majority of the community is decent and orderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, in the age of “cancel culture”, this passage is worth meditating independently of the topic of the present article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these passages are about the stifling effect of social pressure on people’s thoughts and behaviors, which is different though not entirely unrelated to what is going on with big tech companies. But they demonstrate that great authors in the liberal tradition, such as Mill and Tocqueville (as well as many others), but not many contemporary libertarians who claim to represent this tradition today, understood that the state is not the only or even necessarily the worst threat to freedom. Once you recognize that, it becomes impossible, when someone brings up the possibility that e. g. Google manipulates search results, to just cut short the discussion by saying  that it’s a private company, so there is nothing to see. Not only is this not a good argument, it’s not even an argument, only the libertarian equivalent of reciting the &lt;em&gt;credo&lt;/em&gt; for a catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; he delivered in 1922, the great British philosopher Bertrand Russell, who was hardly a conservative, put the point in a way that is more directly relevant to the question I’m discussing in this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal penalties are, however, in the modern world, the least of the obstacles to freedom of thoughts. The two great obstacles are economic penalties and distortion of evidence. It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living. It is clear also that thought is not free if all the arguments on one side of a controversy are perpetually presented as attractively as possible, while the arguments on the other side can only be discovered by diligent search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, big tech companies didn’t exist when Russell wrote that, but what he says about the importance that arguments from all sides be readily accessible is directly relevant to the debate about the manipulations of search results by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there can be little doubt that, were they alive today, the great thinkers in the liberal tradition would not agree with the myopic obsession with state censorship displayed by some of the people who claim to be their intellectual heirs. You can decide that, unless it’s done by the state, it’s not really &lt;em&gt;censorship&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s a purely semantic point. Sure, you can say that if you want (though I don’t think that’s how the word is actually used by ordinary people), but only idiots think it shows that it’s not a problem. Similarly, and I know this is difficult to understand for many libertarians, you can recognize that this kind of censorship, or whatever you want to call it, is bad while thinking that state intervention would actually make things even worse. As I have been stressing throughout this article, those are distinct issues, which can and must be distinguished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that censorship, broadly construed to include even ideological bias that doesn’t rise to the level of systematic suppression of certain viewpoints, is okay as long as it’s not done by the government is preposterous. It’s the kind of things one says, not because one has thought it through and has a reasonable argument for one’s position, but rather because one rigidly adheres to a dogma according to which censorship is only bad when it’s done by the government and there is nothing to worry about as long as it’s done by private companies. Again, it doesn’t follow that big tech companies should be regulated by the government, but we should at least acknowledge that it’s a problem. If you don’t think it’s a problem that e. g. Google, which has a virtual monopoly on Internet search, can manipulate search results for ideological reasons, perhaps a problem that state intervention would only make worse but a problem nonetheless, then you may think that you’re very sophisticated, but actually you are just being ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the line of argument I have developed in this piece should be embraced not only by conservatives, but also by anyone who is attached to freedom of expression in a suitably broad sense. In fact, although it can be leveraged against big tech companies that are biased in favor of liberals, this line of argument also has implications that conservatives may less readily welcome. For instance, it means that how rich people use their money to promote their ideas may also be a problem, insofar as it distorts the marketplace of ideas. Again, it doesn’t imply that regulations should be put in place by the government to restrict the ways in which people can use their wealth to promote their ideas, but if conservatives want to protest against big tech companies on the ground that, by suppressing right-wing content, they are distorting the marketplace of ideas, they can’t talk as if this couldn’t also be a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Censorship is bad even when it's done by private companies</og:title>

&lt;td readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;I'm running a small business on AWS as a solo founder. It's just me. Yesterday I had a service interruption while I was in the London subway. Luckily, I was able to sign in to the AWS console and resolve the issue.
&lt;p&gt;But it does (again) raise the question I'd rather not think about. What if something happens to me and there's another outage that I can't fix?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So - how do you make sure that your servers are up as a one person founder? Can I pay someone to monitor my AWS deploy and make sure it's healthy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
