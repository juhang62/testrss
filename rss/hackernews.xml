&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I once worked as a turkey farmer on a kibbutz in Israel, one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. Something I noticed while employed as a turkey farmer: If one of the turkeys in the pen would get maimed, the other turkeys would gang up on it and try to peck it to death. It was instinctive animal behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what can we learn from turkeys and turkey farming? Is there’s a parallel to the mentality of how internet mob justice plays out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://observer.com/subscribe/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-cta=&quot;newsletter subscribe&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe to Observer’s Business Newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Social media is a great tool, but with great power comes great responsibility. I’m going to go out on a limb here and say we all hate Nazis, racists, homophobes and bullies, right? But, sometimes, lives have been ruined, literally in a matter of seconds, by those who have been wrongfully accused of misdeeds on social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has almost become sport.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the woman in Jon Ronson’s book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; who tweeted out a stupid off-color joke before heading on to a flight—only to land in South Africa to find her life in shambles and the Twitter mob calling for her head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m talking about truly innocent people, who were misidentified or misrepresented, only to have the internet mob grab their metaphorical pitchforks and chase after them. The goal of online shaming is to destroy the person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, let’s examine this phenomenon and take a look at some specific times when internet mob justice has wrongfully played judge and jury.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/internet-shaming-when-mob-justice-goes-virtual/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The case of Kyle Quinn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Arkansas, is a pure Kafkaesque social media nightmare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imagine this scenario: In 2017, Quinn was wrongly identified as a tiki torch-carrying Nazi who marched in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Unite the Right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;rally in Charlottesville. A counter-protester had posted a photo on social media of a man with a beard (Quinn has a beard) wearing a T-shirt (he sometimes wears T-shirts) that said “Arkansas Engineering.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Call it extremely bad luck but somehow Quinn’s name was attached to the bearded man in the photo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only problem is: Quinn is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;a Nazi—and at the time of the rally, he was home in Arkansas watching a nature documentary with his wife. Unaware that an internet mob had already formed against him, Quinn received a concerned phone call from a member of the university relations office—his entire ethical credibility was put on the line because of social media mislabeling, and he had to defend it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have verified that the man in the photo is not assistant professor Quinn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— University of Arkansas (@UArkansas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UArkansas/status/896472227310444544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results? Quinn received Twitter and email threats aimed at him and his wife. The university received calls and emails demanding that they fire Quinn. His home address was also tweeted out, causing safety concerns and forcing Quinn and his wife to hide out at a friend’s house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/internet-shaming-when-mob-justice-goes-virtual/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Quinn’s own words:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; “It was like being chased by a mob.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an ironic twist, the attacks were so vicious that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;the real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; tiki torch-carrying Nazi came forward and expressed his guilt that the wrath of social media had been directed at Quinn, a man who simply wanted a quiet evening at home with his wife watching a nature documentary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Being part of a collective, such as an internet mob, somehow dissolves personal accountability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kite-flying enthusiast Benjamin Franklin once said, “I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f everyone is thinking alike, then no one is thinking.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People are emboldened on social media; the format lends itself to little-to-no consequences for their actions. Add to that a lack of empathy for the target and the endorphins an emotional knee-jerk reaction harvests through “likes” and you’ve got a recipe for an internet mob justice disaster.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Such was the scenario with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3073095/Mother-mistakenly-shames-dad-thought-taking-photos-kids-Facebook-post-shared-hundreds-actually-taking-selfie-Star-Wars-display-children.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the Australian dad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;who simply wanted to take a selfie in front of a Darth Vader display at Target. His intent was to send the selfie to his kids. The only problem: a woman thought the man was taking a photo of her kids and, in turn, took a photo of him, uploaded the photo online and labeled the man a pedophile on social media. The post was shared over 20,000 times—and was seen by the man’s friends, colleagues and family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The man (who asked media not to identify him) received death threats because of the post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He eventually got an apology from the woman, who wrote a retraction post (though the retraction post only got 1/50th of the views of the original post). But the damage was done once the original post was out there as red meat for the social media masses. Google searches permanently tarnish the man’s reputation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And to think, this all began with a simple selfie in front of a cardboard Darth Vader display at Target. Yes, may the force of social media mob justice be with you…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-1183432&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The selfie that sparked a social media firestorm. &lt;span class=&quot;media-credit&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Retweets and likes on Twitter incentivizes people to weigh-in, sometimes, for the purpose of confirmation bias—to confirm to their followers their social and political beliefs with no true investment in a controversy or research into the individual on the other end. Social media is designed to manipulate our desire for approval, even if it’s at the expense of a wrongly accused person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back in November, a woman who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/chipotle-offers-job-back-to-fired-st-paul-manager/500859691/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;worked at Chipotle was fired&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;after she was filmed on a smartphone. Dominique Moran—a college student in St. Paul, Minnesota—got the full internet mob justice treatment when the video footage was taken out of context and went viral on Twitter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suddenly, strangers online were knighting her with the moniker: “Racist bitch.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the video, Moran is seen refusing to serve a group of black men—unless they paid up front. But some major backstory was left out of the video; the group had a sordid history of dining-and-dashing from the very restaurant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They even bragged about it on social media:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Dine and dash is forever interesting,” said one tweet. “Not a dine and dash we’re just borrowing the food for a couple hours that’s all,” read another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the social justice warriors were primed for outrage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The video painting Moran as a racist was re-tweeted over 30,000 times within two days. Moran’s mom even saw it in California and called the next day  to check up on her “racist bitch” daughter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moran discovered that some folks on the left can be just as vicious when they denounce racism.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;People started stalking Moran on social media, not only leaving messages calling her a “dumb whore,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;but also threatening to burn her grandmother’s body and send it to her in a bag.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The incident was framed on Twitter as a white person’s racism against black people. But Moran is Mexican-American. Still, the social justice storyline of people identifying her as white added the element of confirmation bias and helped spread the story. It was a better narrative to paint Moran as a white racist without doing any further research into the incident primed to ruin her life. It’s the same reason that so many people were quick to believe &lt;em&gt;Empire&lt;/em&gt; actor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/08/entertainment/jussie-smollett-indictment/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jussie Smollett&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;when he reported being attacked by two white men wearing MAGA hats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moran was later vindicated—but suffered PTSD, anxiety and depression over the public shaming. She now has panic attacks whenever someone points a smartphone in her direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, Big Brother is watching us, and we are Big Brother. And we will peck the other turkeys to death—if somehow it’s been determined that they must die – whether it’s wrong or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Wrong Abstraction (2016)</title>

&lt;p&gt;_I originally wrote the following for my &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sandimetz.com/subscribe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chainline Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, but I continue to get tweets about this idea, so I'm re-publishing the article here on my blog. This version has been lightly edited._&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about the consequences of the &quot;wrong abstraction.&quot; My RailsConf 2014 &quot;&lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all the little things&lt;/a&gt;&quot; talk included a section where &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE?t=893&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I asserted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the summary, &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE?t=2142&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I went on to advise&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small section of a much bigger talk invoked a surprisingly strong reaction. A few folks suggested that I had lost my mind, but many more expressed sentiments along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This, a million times this! &quot;&lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BonzoESC&quot;&gt;@BonzoESC&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction&quot; &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sandimetz&quot;&gt;@sandimetz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rbonales&quot;&gt;@rbonales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://t.co/3qMI0waqWb&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3qMI0waqWb&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
— 41 shades of blue (@pims) &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pims/status/442010383725760512&quot;&gt;March 7, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of the reaction made me realize just how widespread and intractable the &quot;wrong abstraction&quot; problem is. I started asking questions and came to see the following pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmer A sees duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmer A extracts duplication and gives it a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This creates a new abstraction. It could be a new method, or perhaps even a new class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmer A replaces the duplication with the new abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ah, the code is perfect. Programmer A trots happily away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new requirement appears for which the current abstraction is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmer B gets tasked to implement this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programmer B feels honor-bound to retain the existing abstraction, but since isn't exactly the same for every case, they alter the code to take a parameter, and then add logic to conditionally do the right thing based on the value of that parameter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was once a universal abstraction now behaves differently for different cases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new requirement arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programmer X.&lt;br/&gt;Another additional parameter.&lt;br/&gt;Another new conditional.&lt;br/&gt;Loop until code becomes incomprehensible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You appear in the story about here, and your life takes a dramatic turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing code exerts a powerful influence. Its very presence argues that it is both correct and necessary. We know that code represents effort expended, and we are very motivated to preserve the value of this effort. And, unfortunately, the sad truth is that the more complicated and incomprehensible the code, i.e. the deeper the investment in creating it, the more we feel pressure to retain it (the &quot;&lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sunk cost fallacy&lt;/a&gt;&quot;). It's as if our unconscious tell us &quot;Goodness, that's so confusing, it must have taken &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; to get right. Surely it's really, really important. It would be a sin to let all that effort go to waste.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you appear in this story in step 8 above, this pressure may compel you to proceed forward, that is, to implement the new requirement by changing the existing code. Attempting to do so, however, is brutal. The code no longer represents a single, common abstraction, but has instead become a condition-laden procedure which interleaves a number of vaguely associated ideas. It is hard to understand and easy to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in this situation, resist being driven by sunk costs. When dealing with the wrong abstraction, &lt;em&gt;the fastest way forward is back&lt;/em&gt;. Do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re-introduce duplication by inlining the abstracted code back into every caller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within each caller, use the parameters being passed to determine the subset of the inlined code that this specific caller executes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the bits that aren't needed for this particular caller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This removes both the abstraction &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the conditionals, and reduces each caller to only the code it needs. When you rewind decisions in this way, it's common to find that although each caller ostensibly invoked a shared abstraction, the code they were running was fairly unique. Once you completely remove the old abstraction you can start anew, re-isolating duplication and re-extracting abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen problems where folks were trying valiantly to move forward with the wrong abstraction, but having very little success. Adding new features was incredibly hard, and each success further complicated the code, which made adding the next feature even harder. When they altered their point of view from &quot;I must preserve our investment in this code&quot; to &quot;This code made sense for a while, but perhaps we've learned all we can from it,&quot; and gave themselves permission to re-think their abstractions in light of current requirements, everything got easier. Once they inlined the code, the path forward became obvious, and adding new features become faster and easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of this story? Don't get trapped by the sunk cost fallacy. If you find yourself passing parameters and adding conditional paths through shared code, the abstraction is incorrect. It may have been right to begin with, but that day has passed. Once an abstraction is proved wrong the best strategy is to re-introduce duplication and let it show you what's right. Although it occasionally makes sense to accumulate a few conditionals to gain insight into what's going on, you'll suffer less pain if you abandon the wrong abstraction sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the abstraction is wrong, the fastest way forward is back. This is not retreat, it's advance in a better direction. Do it. You'll improve your own life, and the lives of all who follow.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China suppression of Uighurs meets U.N. definition of genocide, report says</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.npr.org/2020/07/04/887239225/china-suppression-of-uighur-minorities-meets-u-n-definition-of-genocide-report-s</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;storytext&quot; readability=&quot;58&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPR's Scott Simon speaks with China expert Adrian Zenz about his research uncovering evidence of birth prevention and mass female sterilization of Uighur Muslims in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div aria-label=&quot;Transcript&quot; readability=&quot;140.62192855668&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCOTT SIMON, HOST:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new report in Foreign Policy says that China's suppression of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other chiefly Muslim ethnic minorities in northwest China now meets the United Nations definition of genocide, mass sterilization, forced abortions and mandatory birth control part of a campaign that has swept up more than 1.5 million people and what researcher Adrian Zenz calls probably the largest incarceration of an ethnoreligious minority since the Holocaust. Adrian Zenz joins us from Minneapolis. Mr. Zenz, thanks so much for being with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADRIAN ZENZ: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMON: Those words are stunning. Outline for us, if you can, what you found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZENZ: I was able to uncover dedicated policies by Beijing in the region to systematically suppress birthrates and depress population growth. I uncovered evidence that the Uighurs are subject to internment in camps if they violate birth control policies, have too many children. I also uncovered that there's tools to implement intrauterine contraceptive devices and other intrusive surgical birth prevention mechanisms in at least 80% of the targeted women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMON: Eighty percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZENZ: That's the minimum goal for 2019, but I personally believe that the actual was closer probably to 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMON: It is notoriously difficult to do research on the Chinese government, and specifically their policies on the Uighur population. How did you conduct the research? Do you trust the data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZENZ: I do trust the data, which, as before, comes from different types of Chinese government documents, firstly from the Xinjiang National Health Commission, whose website has subsequently gone offline since the publication of my report, from local prefecture government websites and from county websites. We're talking budgets with very detailed target indicator figures, reports, policy documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMON: People need to be careful using the word genocide. Why do you think it's justified and important to use it now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZENZ: I have long argued that the atrocity in the region is a cultural genocide, not a literal genocide. I do continue to believe that, generally speaking, the Chinese government does not intend to physically eradicate the Uighurs and Kazakhs, just to integrate, subjugate, dominate and assimilate them. However, this is coupled with a policy of ethnoracial domination, as the government has brought millions of Han Chinese settler in the regions with promises of high salaries, jobs and free housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why now this has changed - we do need to probably call it a genocide - is quite simply because the evidence now, for the first time, very specifically meets one of the five criteria set forth by the United Nations Convention for the Punishment and Prevention of the Crime of Genocide from 1948, which specifically says the suppression of birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMON: The U.N. has said that up to 1.5 million Uighurs are in internment camps in China. China says this is to contain the threat of terrorism and to reeducate people in the camps to become better Chinese citizens. Behind those statistics are real human lives that have been upended. I wonder what some of the stories you've been able to discover have reached into you the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZENZ: Stories that are among the most harrowing, of course, are stories of abuse, stories of women being caught up by the police and, as they're being brought to the internment camp, the first thing is that they're told, you're going to go on the surgery table, and we're going to put an intrauterine contraceptive device into your body, because that's standard policy for women who are put into a camp. Other women report of forced sterilization, of abuse, even accounts of rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMON: A word like genocide is also supposed to provoke the world to act. What do you believe should or can be done, Mr. Zenz?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZENZ: I think China needs to face consequences by exclusion or sanctioning from multilateral institutions, either political or possibly economic sanctions, given that we also have a situation of forced labor. I think the international community got to start to think real hard how, with what kind of actions it's going to back up its professed and supposed moral values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIMON: Adrian Zenz is a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Mr. Zenz, thanks so much for being with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZENZ: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>The Linux Foundation recently uploaded its video from the &lt;em&gt;Open Source Summit and Embedded Linux Conference: Europe.&lt;/em&gt; And there was a poignant moment when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Gd9t7FQqI&quot;&gt;Linus Torvalds did his traditional keynote conversation with Dirk Hohndel&lt;/a&gt;, VMware's vice president and chief open source officer.&lt;p&gt;Honndel had asked Linus — his hair now uncharacteristically long — what he spends his time on as a kernel maintainer. What's his workflow? &quot;What do you do?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linus Torvalds:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, I read email. &lt;em&gt;[Hohndel laughs]&lt;/em&gt; I read email, I write email, I do no coding at all any more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the code I write, I actually write inside my mail reader. So somebody sends me a patch, or more commonly they send me a pull request or there's a discussion about the next pull request, and there's something I react to and say, 'No, this is fine, but...' And I send out pseudocode, or — I'm so used to sending out patches that I sometimes edit patches and send out the patch without having ever compiled it, ever tested it, because I literally wrote it in the mail reader, and saying 'I think this is how it should be done.' But this is what I do. I'm not a programmer any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read a lot more email than I write, because what my job really is — in the end, my job is to say no. Somebody has to be able to say no to people. Because other developers know that if they do something bad, I will say no. They hopefully, in turn, are more careful. But in order to be able to say no, I have to know the background. Because otherwise I can't do my job. So I spend all my time, basically, reading email about what people are working on... It is an interesting job, but you do end up spending most of your time reading email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the developer side, what I hope people are doing is trying to make, not just good code, but these days we've been very good about having explanations for the code. So commit messages to me are almost as important as the code change itself. Sometimes the code change is so obvious that no message is really required, but that is very very rare. And so one of the things I hope developers are thinking about, the people who are actually writing code, is not just the code itself, but explaining why the code does something, and why some change was needed. Because that then in turn helps the managerial side of the equation, where if you can explain your code to me, I will trust the code...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of open source in general is about communication. And part of it is the commit messages, part of it is just the email going back and forth. Communicating what you're trying to do or communicating why something doesn't work for you is really important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, consultants help solve problems for people who run companies and other organizations. The client defines the problem, and the consultant helps find a solution. But there are consultants … and then there’s McKinsey &amp;amp; Company.&lt;/p&gt;

It tackles the hardest problems for the biggest clients—and the fees it charges those clients reflect all this. They’re the bluest-chip management consultants around. And that’s why, over the course of nearly 100 years in business, McKinsey has been able to adapt to changing market conditions and skate through crises with little harm to its bottom line. Most companies see periodic dips in demand for their products and services, but there’s rarely been a down market for what McKinsey has to offer—because McKinsey sells solutions to other companies’ problems. What sorts of problems? Whatever you got.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9im9z001b3h63yoso29qa@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;86&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;“For all my criticisms and questions about McKinsey, I think it’s one of the most brilliant ideas for a business that anybody’s ever had,” says Duff McDonald, who wrote a history of McKinsey titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439190984/?tag=slatmaga-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Firm: The Story of McKinsey and Its Secret Influence on American Business&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He called management consulting “one of the most flexible business models in the history of Western capitalism.” “There is a certain brilliant essence to a company which sells what you’re buying, as opposed to what they’re selling,” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9iman001c3h63spic1esm@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;156&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;The guy who had that idea, back in the 1920s, was an accounting professor named James McKinsey. At the time, accounting basically meant one thing: keeping track of the money that came in and the money that went out. You spend a dollar, you wrote it down. You earned $5, you wrote it down. At the end of the month, you added it all up and reconciled the past with the present. But what James McKinsey realized was that a smart company could use those same techniques to see the future. You could look at those numbers—numbers that represented costs and revenues—and use them as the basis for next year’s budget, or to chart a long-term corporate strategy. Maybe that seems sort of obvious? Well, it wasn’t obvious in 1926. And while a few people had similar insights right around that time, James McKinsey was the only one to build a massive consulting company around it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9imbv001d3h63dujbep35@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;102&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;He positioned his company as elite right from the start. The young firm was very selective about its client list, on the notion that you’re judged by the company you keep. How do you become a top-tier firm? By working exclusively for top-tier clients—and thus the McKinsey mythos was born. But though James McKinsey lent his name to the enterprise, it was his successor who gave the firm its soul. “If you’re going to be serious about a real history of McKinsey, you have to quickly move to the man who inherited or grabbed leadership of the firm, Marvin Bower,” says McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9imcq001e3h63kndfv2yo@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;168&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;Under Marvin Bower, McKinsey would respect the numbers, but it would refuse to be bound by them. Instead, the firm would offer advice and counsel of all sorts. If James McKinsey had turned accountants into consultants, then Bower turned consultants into professionals. To Bower, a professional was discreet; a professional talked and dressed like those top executives. McKinsey consultants were even required to wear hats right up until the 1960s, when John F. Kennedy changed the world by appearing in public with a bare head. But most importantly, Bower thought a professional should give clients the good advice they might not get internally and tell them the hard truths they might not want to hear. A professional, in Bower’s estimation, would do what was best for the client, not what was most lucrative for the adviser. “He basically said to their clients, ‘We will put your interests ahead of ours always,’ ” says McDonald. “And that is the foundation upon which McKinsey’s entire reputation and business was built.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote__text&quot; data-editable=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“It’s a lot easier to say to your employees … ‘I didn’t want to do this, but we went and asked McKinsey, and this is their advice.’ McKinsey will willingly be the&lt;span class=&quot;widont&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;scapegoat.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote__attribution&quot; data-editable=&quot;settings&quot;&gt;— Duff McDonald&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9imdn001f3h63zbk9pcup@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;42&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;So, OK, consultants work for management. They’re trained to identify with management. And when there’s a conflict between what’s good for people who run the companies and what’s good for everyone else, which side would you expect the consultants to be on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9imgi001g3h63k7jeyuhs@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;65&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;In 1951, a McKinsey consultant published a study in Harvard Business Review showing that ordinary worker wages were rising roughly three times as fast as executive wages. “This study made the rounds among elite American executives,” says Daniel Markovits, a Yale law professor and author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735221995/?tag=slatmaga-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meritocracy Trap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The elite executives took the view that they would like their compensation to grow more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9imqh001h3h632yipt78z@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;123&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;So the executives started bringing new problems to the consultants: foreign competition, increasing costs, declining profits. And what the McKinsey consultants started telling them was, broadly, “Do you really need all those middle managers?” Of course, most executives don’t enjoy putting people out of work, and they certainly don’t like being seen as heartless. Fortunately, that’s another problem McKinsey can help them with. Once a company has decided to fire a bunch of people, McDonald says, “it’s a lot easier to say to your employees … the ones who will still be showing up to work, that ‘I didn’t want to do this, but we went and asked McKinsey, and this is their advice.’ McKinsey will willingly be the scapegoat for that story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9imr5001i3h6341qh8gs7@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;102&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;And the McKinsey consultant who gives the manager that advice also gets to avoid having to feel responsible for putting people out of work. “If I’m working at McKinsey, when I decide to give the best professional advice I can, following the principles of integrity that McKinsey insists on for its workers, I don’t characterize myself as having fired 50,000 people,” Markovits explains. “What I’ve done is give the best professional advice that I can. And that’s a perfectly apt way to think about your life, but from a systematic or a structural perspective, it insulates everybody from responsibility for terrible outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9ims0001j3h63l5iqzoxa@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;100&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;Over the course of its history, McKinsey has advised downsizing for so many different companies that, according to Duff McDonald, the firm may well be “the single greatest legitimizer of mass layoffs [of] anyone, anywhere, at any time in modern history.” The wave of layoffs that tore through the economy from the ’70s through the ’90s changed the shape of the American corporation. Afterward, there were fewer employees in that middle tier coordinating between the production line and the executive suite. Corporate jobs were increasingly divided between replaceable cogs at the bottom and stressed-out captains of industry at the top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9in2i001k3h63xlfwoep1@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;141&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;Of course, losing all those white-collar workers in the middle saved companies a lot of money. Some of that money went to profits. Some of it went to the consulting firms they brought in to help them. And some of it went to the salaries of those increasingly important top executives. According to Markovits, this is exactly how the meritocracy looks after its own interests. “It’s not part of my argument that places like McKinsey or Boston Consulting Group or Bain or any of these other elite consulting shops are snake oil salespeople,” he says. “They are providing real skill and expertise. It’s just that when companies manage themselves using skill and expertise delivered in this way, what ends up happening is that they increase the wages of really elite managers and graduates of fancy universities and decrease everybody else’s wages.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9in3t001l3h631sgo15lz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;145&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;The changes to business practices that began in the 1970s were soon consolidated into an ideology: the idea that a company’s only responsibility is to maximize the value of its shares. This idea, known as “shareholder value,” was promoted by the conservative economist Milton Friedman and taken up by a variety of CEOs and corporate raiders who saw it as a path to growth and profit in that era’s stagnant economy. For consulting firms such as McKinsey, that meant a booming market for cost-controlling, value-maximizing advice—and sometimes this advice went wrong. McKinsey advised Time Warner on its merger with AOL, one of the largest and most disastrous mergers in history. It spent more than a decade consulting for a sleepy Houston energy company named Enron, which, under the leadership of former McKinsey partner Jeffrey Skilling, grew into a $100 billion fraud that collapsed in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-uri=&quot;slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/ckbs9in4h001m3h6370vk7iup@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;60&quot; class=&quot;slate-paragraph&quot;&gt;Over the past 20 years, McKinsey has also expanded its work for governments and the public sector, and governments all over the world have signed on. This very April, as a matter of fact, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York hired McKinsey to consult on coronavirus recovery plans. The mission, one source told Reuters, is to make the plan “Trump-proof.”&lt;/p&gt;

The firm has contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and was at one point even involved in Jared Kushner’s coronavirus task force. And it’s not just for public health, either. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/mckinsey-ICE-immigration.html&quot;&gt;According to ProPublica and the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, when the Trump administration in 2017 directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ramp up detentions, McKinsey consultants allegedly suggested that the agency save money by cutting spending on food and medical care for detainees. These recommendations were a bridge too far even for ICE, according to ProPublica and the Times, and the agency did not pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

It was involved in a massive corruption scandal in South Africa. It worked on behalf of the thoroughly corrupt ex-president of Ukraine and for Russian companies under sanctions. It was “horrified to learn that a report they prepared on the public’s reaction to Saudi Arabian government austerity measures may have been used by that regime for the purpose of silencing dissidents.” McKinsey has challenged the Times’ conclusions about its work with ICE and on behalf of governments in Southeast Asia, China, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

Before Bower died in 2003, according to Duff McDonald’s book, he told a friend the firm had become “greedy fucks.” McKinsey started as a business that sold candid, dispassionate advice to corporate managers, but selling advice and building a brand around it also sets up a mechanism for diffusing responsibility. The managers can say they’re just following the best available advice, and the consultants can say they’re just trying to help their clients boost profits and efficiency. But if you work for anyone, and you serve their interests as best you can, and you define those interests in the narrowest and most mercenary terms, you’re going to end up with dirty hands.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Florida becomes first state to enact DNA privacy law, blocking insurers</title>
<link>https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/florida-becomes-first-state-to-enact-dna-privacy-law-blocking-insurers-from-genetic-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/florida-becomes-first-state-to-enact-dna-privacy-law-blocking-insurers-from-genetic-data</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;RichTextArticleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;RichTextArticleBody-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ArticlePage-articleBody-firstLetter&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;lorida on Wednesday became the nation’s first state to enact a DNA privacy law, prohibiting life, disability and long-term care insurance companies from using genetic tests for coverage purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gov. Ron DeSantis signed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=69459&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House Bill 1189&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by Rep. Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor. It extends federal prohibitions against health insurance providers accessing results from DNA tests, such as those offered by 23andMe or AncestryDNA, to the three other insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprowls, the House speaker-designate, called the legislation a “major victory for Floridians” that “will make Florida the leader in the nation in protecting our residents and our citizens’ genetic information” when it was adopted by the House, 110-0, and the Senate, 35-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the continued rise in popularity of DNA testing kits,” Sprowls said Tuesday, “it was imperative we take action to protect Floridians’ DNA data from falling into the hands of an insurer who could potentially weaponize that information against current or prospective policyholders in the form of rate increases or exclusionary policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law prevents health insurers from using genetic information in underwriting policies and in setting premiums, but the prohibition doesn’t apply to life, disability or long-term care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers argue information gleaned from genetic testing, such as a person’s medical predispositions, could lower insurance premiums across-the-board. Lawmakers, however, said the same rationale could be used to raise rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprowls, a cancer survivor, discovered the “massive loophole” could be exploited by insurers while on hold during a phone call to a life insurance company in 2017 and the dead air was filled with commercials from DNA-testing companies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under HB 1189, insurers are prohibited from using genetic information to price policies and offerings. The bill blocks companies from requiring or soliciting genetic information from applicants and forbids DNA testing companies provide genetic information to insurers without the customer’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals still can volunteer genetic information from third-party tests to insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, who sponsored the Senate version of Sprowls’ bill, said it will “rightfully protect Floridians from violations of privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am proud of our state for being the first in the nation to protect our citizens from this threat,” Stargel said. “It is my hope that with this legislation signed into law that it will become a model for the rest of the country as DNA testing becomes more ubiquitous and the need for privacy laws becomes even greater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of comprehensive federal genetic privacy regulation, state legislatures have adopted a wide-ranging matrix of laws that typically restrict third parties – such as insurers or employers – from accessing genetic data without consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), Florida is among 16 states that require informed consent for a third party to perform, require or obtain genetic information, among 24 states that require informed consent to disclose genetic information, and among five states that define genetic information as personal property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the legislation, if DNA test results end up in a person’s health records, insurance providers legally can access it, although the federal 2008 Genetic Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits them from using that information to deny coverage or increase rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Florida, that federal prohibition also now applies to long-term-care, life and disability insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic privacy likely will remain on lawmakers' agendas in coming years as direct-to-consumer testing gain in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among concerns lawmakers may address is revelations several Florida condo associations require prospective residents to submit DNA test results showing they don’t have genetic predispositions to Alzheimer’s, which is legal everywhere but California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The Comeback of Fun in Visual Design</title>
<link>https://applypixels.com/blog/comeback</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://applypixels.com/blog/comeback</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s finally here. The thing I have been advocating for through my work, writing, videos and talks for &lt;strong&gt;years&lt;/strong&gt;. A swing of the pendulum. A reemergence of fun in visual design. I have been waiting 7 years to write this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the redesign of macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple has made many interface changes and updated the appearance of apps. Materials and dimensionality has made its way back into the interface —and every single app icon for every application and utility that Apple ships with macOS has been redesigned with depth, textures and lighting. This is a big deal. Probably bigger than what most people realise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://applypixels-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2020/07/icongrid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;macOS Big Sur Dock&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-925 size-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all big shifts in design, you’re going to get a lot of noise. People will try to co-opt this new direction and attempt to label it as something it’s not (looking at you neomorphism). People will find fault with the execution. People will disagree that there’s even a change. There’ll be snark. There'll be a period of adjustment. There’s a lot to talk about— but I think most of it misses the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a philosophical change in the role of visual design and one some of us have been working towards for a long time. It’s just the beginning, but I think we’re on the cusp of a new era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://applypixels-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2020/07/comeback1.png&quot; alt=&quot;macOS Big Sur Dock&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-925 size-full&quot;/&gt;macOS 11 Big Sur previewed at WWDC 2020, features a new design.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;howwegothere&quot;&gt;How We Got Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly understand this change, you need to understand where the pendulum swung when iOS 7 was introduced in 2013. You’ve heard this story a million times &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.prototypr.io/bringing-back-skeuomorphic-design-d211cc1c22d2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;from me&lt;/a&gt;, but here it is condensed: iOS 7, with its minimalist ui, white space layouts and magazine typesetting represented a shift in the role that visual design had to fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://applypixels-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2020/07/ios7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iOS 7&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-925 size-full&quot;/&gt;iOS 7 introduced in 2013 featured a radical new visual design direction.

&lt;p&gt;Under the rule of minimalism, visual design for the sake of design took a backseat. A successful interface was one that visually didn’t call attention to itself. The fewer visual embellishments an interface had, the more effective and clean it was considered. As little interface as possible, was the best interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the great flattening of our interfaces was an obvious reaction to the skeuomorphic era that came before it. It was the industrial designers’ dream come true. The Jony Ive-ification of the digital surfaces around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea that we could throw off the silly follies of using real world cues to evolve the abstract interface to its simplest form. That the interface had a natural evolution and that minimalism was the next logical step. Under this philosophy a designer’s job was to most effectively, and with as little complexity as possible, communicate a feature or get users from a to b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also the great democratisation of design. With the bar lowered for visual design, the industry became far more approachable and a new (far larger) generation of designers came of age that held minimalism in high regard. New tools sprung up to service them and a cottage industry of design-titles (UX Designers, UI Designers, Interaction Designers, Brand Designers, Product Designers) dotted the spectrum of putting pixels on screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to be enamoured by the story of the evolved interface. It fits so well with other narratives of human progress. And it’s hard to argue that it wasn’t time for a shakeup and a new paradigm around the time iOS 7 came out. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with striving for simplicity as one of the pillars of design. The problem arises when it becomes the &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; pillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I wrote in my 2018 post &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.prototypr.io/bringing-back-skeuomorphic-design-d211cc1c22d2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Bringing back Skeuomorphic Design”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;&quot;What I am saying, and what I have always said, is that design can be anything we want it to be. We should strive to make fun and memorable experiences that are appropriate to the context, but not arbitrarily restricted.&lt;p&gt;There’s a great deal of sameness in design these days and I think we can challenge that if we’re willing to let go some of the minimalist ideals and start thinking about how we can infuse our designs with fun. Start thinking about form instead of just function. Allow ourselves to embellish in the name of orchestrating an experience. Delight as a differentiating factor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have been following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixelresort.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my work&lt;/a&gt; will hopefully recognise some action behind these words. Most of what I produce tries to live up to this, and I’ve been lucky to find clients that still wanted this brand of design. People who have watched my &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com/flarup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; or sat in my icon design workshops or heard one of my talks have all been exposed to this brand of thinking. A pursuit and rekindling of fun in design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem with minimalism as the overarching goal of visual design is the restraint it puts on emotion. When your goal is to take away as much as possible for it to be as effective as possible— it leaves very little room for expression. This intersection between art and design is a hotbed for discussion and something we’ll probably be discussing long after I’m done pushing pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the release of iOS 7 Apple have walked back some of the more stark minimalistic choices. Text labels became buttons again, subtle gradients returned and tactility crept back into our interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://applypixels-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2019/07/segmented.png&quot; alt=&quot;changes to iOS&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-925 size-full&quot;/&gt;Subtle changes to iOS have in recent years walked back some of the minimalism in the interface.
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen a lot of people produce balanced work that falls somewhere between the skeuomorphic heyday and the flat minimalism. Yet, iOS 14 still remains largely flat. Icons are glyphs on colored backgrounds. Realistic lighting and shadows in app icons on the platform are still largely done to stand out rather than fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thecomeback&quot;&gt;The Comeback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the redesign of macOS 11, Apple had an opportunity to carry forward the minimalism that still prevails on its other platforms. Many suspected that some visual unification would take place and that the minimalism Apple themselves had championed would swallow up any last vestiges of realism or expressiveness in visual design on the mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why not? Apple doesn’t strike me as a particularly sentimental company and we’ve seen them make these sweeping visual changes before. But then WWDC 2020 live-streamed to millions of people and there was macOS Big Sur, redesigned with all new icons and rules for a ‘lifelike rendering style’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://applypixels-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2020/07/bigsur.gif&quot; alt=&quot;macOS Big Sur&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-925 size-full&quot;/&gt;The reveal of the all new, redesigned, macOS 11 Big Sur.

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/whats-new-in-macos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;newly released HIG:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;“In macOS 11, the design language for app icons promotes consistency with all platforms while retaining the lifelike rendering style typical of macOS icons. App icons combine a rounded-rectangle shape, a front-facing perspective, and a consistent drop shadow to provide a unified visual experience.&lt;p&gt;Although the design language strongly encourages visual consistency, it doesn’t preclude judicious expressiveness. For example, the Preview, Xcode, and TextEdit icons continue to combine depictions of the physical objects that best convey the app’s core purpose, while incorporating the new shape, perspective, and shadow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re squircles alright, which brings them inline with the other platforms, but they also feature things like materials, lighting and radiosity. Some of them depict physical objects in a style that can only really be called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;skeuomorphic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://applypixels-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2020/07/bigsur-icons.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;changes to iOS&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-925 size-full&quot;/&gt;Big Sur app icons feature lifelike renderings.

&lt;p&gt;We all instantly had a lot to say about the execution of the specific icons (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/flarup/status/1275132320169721856?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;myself included&lt;/a&gt;), but let’s forget the execution for a moment and think about what this means for visual design as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Apple is essentially saying here is that &lt;strong&gt;“judicious expressiveness”&lt;/strong&gt; is allowed. A lifelike rendering style is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really understand the impact this will have, you’ve got to appreciate how influential Apple design is in the larger design industry. Being the native platform for most creative people in the world, the interface design of iOS and macOS is what’s staring back at us every day. As clearly proved by the paradigm shift that iOS 7 and flat design exercised on everything from apps to icons to websites— what Apple does &lt;strong&gt;matters&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the chance of a redesign on the mac, Apple did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; choose minimalism as the single guiding design pillar. In fact, they doubled down on expressiveness, added depth, gaussian blur shadows, angled lighting and real lifelike objects. Sure, it’s not consistent and we lost some expressiveness elsewhere (🥃 pour one out for detailed toolbar icons), but generally this is like a green light turning on for more expressiveness and ultimately more fun in visual design. They didn't just keep this for nostalgia's sake, they developed it further. They advanced it and are pushing it out to millions of Mac users later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this approach Apple is legalising a visual design expressiveness that we haven’t seen from them in almost a decade. It’s like a ban has been lifted on fun. This will severely loosen the grip of minimalistic visual design and raise the bar for pixel pushers everywhere. Your glyph on a colored background is about to get some serious visual competition. If you don’t believe me, it’s now one week after WWDC and dribbble is &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/search/big%20sur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overflowing with app icon redesigns&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve seen at least 3 major icon sets in the works (remember replacement icon sets?). &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/flarup/status/1275923118616387586?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yes, I'm working on one too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://applypixels-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2020/07/dribbble-icons.png&quot; alt=&quot;changes to iOS&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-925 size-full&quot;/&gt;dribbble has been packed with icon redesigns this past week.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even if Apple never intended for this style to make it into, say, the native icons on iOS or iPadOS, we’re going to see it spill over around them. Since the announcement I’ve gotten daily inquiries into my app icon design services. From my seat right now, it truly does feel like the dam has broken. How big of an impact the wave is going to make and how far it’ll travel is uncertain, but it’s certainly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of other interesting perspectives to this that ultimately could merit their own articles. There’s a generation of designers that wasn’t brought up on this pedigree of visual design. How do we train them? In just the past week I’ve seen many people try to make Figma, XD and Sketch do things that they’ve never done with it before. Will this generation switch back to Photoshop? Is Adobe about to have a field day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also an interesting thought about the reasoning for doubling down on this dimensionality and realism and it has to do with AR. Flat minimalistic UI and iconography doesn’t blend well into the real world. Sharp corners feel threatening in human scale and so we’re being directed towards softer, rounder, approachable designs that will more easily make the jump to a mixed reality in a post-Apple-glasses world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cynics will say that the pendulum will swing back to flat in a few years and that it’s all part of the cyclical nature of design trends. I don’t think the pendulum swings all the way back. Sure, there’s an aspect of fashion to design—what’s in vogue today won’t be tomorrow—but I think this is more about the scale balancing out than it is the pendulum swinging back. Fun and “judicious expressiveness” is back to stay—not because fashions have changed but because it has value. It took us losing it to realise that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now at least, as someone who has been advocating for more expressiveness and fun in visual design for years, I couldn’t be more happy for the comeback. I’m excited to see what fun it’ll bring.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hong Kong: books by pro-democracy activists disappear from library shelves</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/05/hong-kong-books-by-pro-democracy-activists-disappear-from-library-shelves</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/05/hong-kong-books-by-pro-democracy-activists-disappear-from-library-shelves</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Books written by prominent Hong Kong democracy activists have started to disappear from the city’s libraries, online records show, days after Beijing imposed a new national security law on the finance hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Among the authors whose titles are no longer available are Joshua Wong, one of the city’s most prominent young activists, and Tanya Chan, a well known pro-democracy lawmaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Beijing’s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/china-passes-controversial-hong-kong-national-security-law&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;national security law came into force on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and is the most radical shift in how the semi-autonomous city is run since it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;China’s authoritarian leaders say the powers will restore stability after a year of pro-democracy protests, will not stifle freedoms and will only target a “very small minority”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;But it has already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/hong-kong-activists-shut-down-protest-groups-after-china-passes-security-law&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;sent fear coursing through a city used to speaking openly&lt;/a&gt;, with police arresting people for possessing slogans pushing independence or greater autonomy and businesses scrambling to remove protest displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Wong said he believed the removal of the books was sparked by the security law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;“White terror continues to spread, the national security law is fundamentally a tool to incriminate speech,” he wrote on Facebook, using a phrase that refers to political persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Searches on the public library website showed at least three titles by Wong, Chan and local scholar Chin Wan are no longer available for lending at any of dozens of outlets across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;An Agence France-Presse reporter was unable to find the titles at a public library in the district of Wong Tai Sin on Saturday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;The city’s cultural services department, which runs libraries, said books had been removed while it is determined whether they violate the national security law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;“In the process of the review the books will not be available for borrowing and reference,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;The law targets acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;China says it will have jurisdiction in some cases and empowered its security apparatus to set up shop openly in Hong Kong for the first time, ending the legal firewall between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Rights groups and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/30/controversial-hong-kong-national-security-law-comes-into-effect&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot;&gt;legal analysts say the broad wording of the law – which was kept secret until it was enacted – outlaws certain political views&lt;/a&gt;, even if expressed peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Any promotion of independence or greater autonomy appears to be banned by the legislation. Another vaguely worded provision bans inciting hatred towards the Chinese or Hong Kong government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;On the Chinese mainland, similar national security laws are routinely used to crush dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;The new security law and the removal of books raised questions of whether academic freedom still exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;Hong Kong has some of Asia’s best universities and a campus culture where topics that would be taboo on the mainland are still discussed and written about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-ca4fse&quot;&gt;But Beijing has made clear it wants education in the city to become more “patriotic” especially after a year of huge, often violent and largely youth-led pro-democracy protests.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The cost to train an AI system is improving at 50x the pace of Moore’s Law</title>
<link>https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/ai-training/</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;wysiwyg&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to train an artificial intelligence (AI) system is improving at 50x the pace of Moore’s Law. For many use cases, the cost to run an AI inference system has collapsed to almost nil. After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded. After doubling every two years from 1960 to 2010, AI compute complexity has soared 10x every year, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7823 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang&quot; width=&quot;1360&quot; height=&quot;936&quot; srcset=&quot;https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1.png 1360w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-300x206.png 300w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-1024x705.png 1024w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-768x529.png 768w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-200x138.png 200w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-192x132.png 192w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-65x45.png 65w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-611x421.png 611w, https://ark-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ARK-Invest-AI-Training-Eras-of-Compute-Graph-1-520x358.png 520w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that companies have had ample incentive to increase computing resources at five times the rate of Moore’s Law: significant competitive advantages in revenue generation and hardware cost declines rapid enough to keep fueling the beast. As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.&lt;a class=&quot;note&quot; href=&quot;https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/ai-training/#ft1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/benchmark/ImageNet/train.html&quot;&gt;ResNet-50&lt;/a&gt; on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.&lt;a class=&quot;note&quot; href=&quot;https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/ai-training/#ft2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.&lt;a class=&quot;note&quot; href=&quot;https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/ai-training/#ft3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below. Holding hardware improvements constant, newer versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch AI frameworks in concert with novel training methods combine to generate an 8x performance gain, as shown in the right chart below.&lt;a class=&quot;note&quot; href=&quot;https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/ai-training/#ft&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, AI training chip costs have not dropped in tandem with unit hardware prices. The price of Nvidia’s data center GPU, for example, has tripled over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.nvidia.com/home/default.aspx&quot;&gt;last three generations.&lt;/a&gt; In fact, Amazon Web Services has not lowered the price of Nvidia’s V100 GPU instances since it introduced them &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/&quot;&gt;in 2017.&lt;/a&gt; Competition from independent and hyperscale AI chip designs does have the potential to erode Nvidia’s pricing power, but so far, no company has been able to field a comparable chip to Nvidia’s V100 GPU with the same breadth of software and developer support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the pace of its cost decline, AI is in very early days. During the first decade of Moore’s Law, transistor count doubled every year—or at twice the rate of change seen during decades thereafter. The 10-100x cost declines we are witnessing in both AI training and AI inference suggest that AI is nascent in its development, perhaps with decades of slower but sustained growth ahead. As shown above, based on ARK’s research, while thus far AI has added roughly $1 trillion to the global equity market cap, it is poised to scale to $30 trillion by 2037, becoming the first foundational technology to dwarf the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rich is a Python library for &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt; text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rich API&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to add color and style to terminal output. Rich can also render pretty tables, progress bars, markdown, syntax highlighted source code, tracebacks, and more — out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/features.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/features.png&quot; alt=&quot;Features&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a video introduction to Rich see &lt;a href=&quot;https://calmcode.io/rich/introduction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;calmcode.io&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fishnets88&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@fishnets88&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich works with Linux, OSX, and Windows. True color / emoji works with new Windows Terminal, classic terminal is limited to 8 colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich also works with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyter.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jupyter notebooks&lt;/a&gt; with no additional configuration required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; or your favorite PyPi package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pip install rich
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rich print function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#quick-start&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rich print&lt;/a&gt; method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function. Try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, [bold magenta]World[/bold magenta]!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;:vampire:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;locals&lt;/span&gt;())
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/print.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/print.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello World&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the Console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/console.html#rich.console.Console&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Console object has a &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; method which has an intentionally similar interface to the builtin &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function. Here's an example of use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, this will print &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the terminal. Note that unlike the builtin &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function, Rich will word-wrap your text to fit within the terminal width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways of adding color and style to your output. You can set a style for the entire output by adding a &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; keyword argument. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;bold red&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output will be something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/hello_world.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/hello_world.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello World&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's fine for styling a line of text at a time. For more finely grained styling, Rich renders a special markup which is similar in syntax to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bbcode&lt;/a&gt;. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Where there is a [bold cyan]Will[/bold cyan] there [u]is[/u] a [i]way[/i].&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/where_there_is_a_will.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/where_there_is_a_will.png&quot; alt=&quot;Console Markup&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Console logging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Console object has a &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt; method which has a similar interface to &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;, but also renders a column for the current time and the file and line which made the call. By default Rich will do syntax highlighting for Python structures and for repr strings. If you log a collection (i.e. a dict or a list) Rich will pretty print it so that it fits in the available space. Here's an example of some of these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;()

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;test_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; [
    {&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;jsonrpc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;2.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;method&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;sum&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;params&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: [&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,},
    {&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;jsonrpc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;2.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;method&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;notify_hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;params&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: [&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;]},
    {&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;jsonrpc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;2.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;method&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;subtract&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;params&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: [&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;], &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;},
]

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;test_log&lt;/span&gt;():
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {

    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;movies&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Deadpool&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Rise of the Skywalker&quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello from&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;test_data&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;log_locals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;)


&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;test_log&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above produces the following output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/log.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/log.png&quot; alt=&quot;Log&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;log_locals&lt;/code&gt; argument, which outputs a table containing the local variables where the log method was called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log method could be used for logging to the terminal for long running applications such as servers, but is also a very nice debugging aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Logging Handler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use the builtin &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Handler class&lt;/a&gt; to format and colorize output from Python's logging module. Here's an example of the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/logging.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/logging.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logging&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emoji&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;:smiley: :vampire: :pile_of_poo: :thumbs_up: :raccoon:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
😃 🧛 💩 👍 🦝
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use this feature wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich can render flexible &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tables.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tables&lt;/a&gt; with unicode box characters. There is a large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/table_movie.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/table_movie.gif&quot; alt=&quot;table movie&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation above was generated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/examples/table_movie.py&quot;&gt;table_movie.py&lt;/a&gt; in the examples directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simpler table example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Column&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;()

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Table&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;show_header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;header_style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;bold magenta&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_column&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Date&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;dim&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_column&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_column&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Production Budget&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;justify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;right&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_column&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Box Office&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;justify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;right&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_row&lt;/span&gt;(
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Dev 20, 2019&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;$275,000,000&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;$375,126,118&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_row&lt;/span&gt;(
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;May 25, 2018&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;[red]Solo[/red]: A Star Wars Story&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;$275,000,000&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;$393,151,347&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;add_row&lt;/span&gt;(
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Dec 15, 2017&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Star Wars Ep. VIII: The Last Jedi&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;$262,000,000&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;[bold]$1,332,539,889[/bold]&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
)

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This produces the following output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/table.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/table.png&quot; alt=&quot;table&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that console markup is rendered in the same way as &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, anything that is renderable by Rich may be included in the headers / rows (even other tables).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Table&lt;/code&gt; class is smart enough to resize columns to fit the available width of the terminal, wrapping text as required. Here's the same example, with the terminal made smaller than the table above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/table2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/table2.png&quot; alt=&quot;table2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Progress Bars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich can render multiple flicker-free &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/progress.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/a&gt; bars to track long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For basic usage, wrap any sequence in the &lt;code&gt;track&lt;/code&gt; function and iterate over the result. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;track&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;track&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;)):
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;do_step&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not much harder to add multiple progress bars. Here's an example taken from the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/progress.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/progress.gif&quot; alt=&quot;progress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The columns may be configured to show any details you want. Built-in columns include percentage complete, file size, file speed, and time remaining. Here's another example showing a download in progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/downloader.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/downloader.gif&quot; alt=&quot;progress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try this out yourself, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/examples/downloader.py&quot;&gt;examples/downloader.py&lt;/a&gt; which can download multiple URLs simultaneously while displaying progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Columns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich can render content in neat &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/columns.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/a&gt; with equal or optimal width. Here's a very basic clone of the (MacOS / Linux) &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; command which displays a directory listing in columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Columns&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;listdir&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;])
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Columns&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot is the output from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/examples/columns.py&quot;&gt;columns example&lt;/a&gt; which displays data pulled from an API in columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/columns.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/columns.png&quot; alt=&quot;columns&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich can render &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markdown.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; and does a reasonable job of translating the formatting to the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render markdown import the &lt;code&gt;Markdown&lt;/code&gt; class and construct it with a string containing markdown code. Then print it to the console. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;README.md&quot;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;readme&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;())
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will produce output something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/markdown.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/markdown.png&quot; alt=&quot;markdown&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syntax Highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pygments.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pygments&lt;/a&gt; library to implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/a&gt;. Usage is similar to rendering markdown; construct a &lt;code&gt;Syntax&lt;/code&gt; object and print it to the console. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;syntax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Syntax&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;def iter_first_last(values: Iterable[T]) -&amp;gt; Iterable[Tuple[bool, bool, T]]:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    &quot;&quot;&quot;Iterate and generate a tuple with a flag for first and last value.&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    iter_values = iter(values)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    try:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        previous_value = next(iter_values)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    except StopIteration:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        return&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    first = True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    for value in iter_values:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        yield first, False, previous_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        first = False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;        previous_value = value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;    yield first, True, previous_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;syntax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Syntax&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;my_code&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;python&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;monokai&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;line_numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-v&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s1&quot;&gt;syntax&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will produce the following output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tracebacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich can render beautiful tracebacks which are easier to read and show more code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what it looks like on OSX (similar on Linux):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/traceback.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/traceback.png&quot; alt=&quot;traceback&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what it looks like on Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/traceback_windows.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/raw/master/imgs/traceback_windows.png&quot; alt=&quot;traceback_windows&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/traceback.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;rich traceback&lt;/a&gt; documentation for the details.&lt;/p&gt;
