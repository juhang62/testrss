<title>The struggles of an open source maintainer</title>

<description>&lt;section id=&quot;newslist&quot;&gt;&lt;article data-news-id=&quot;129&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;comment&quot; data-comment-id=&quot;129-&quot; id=&quot;129-&quot; readability=&quot;78.940261423787&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/user/antirez&quot;&gt;antirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 14 hours ago. 26700 views.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Months ago the maintainer of an OSS project in the sphere of system software, with quite a big and active community, wrote me an email saying that he struggles to continue maintaining his project after so many years, because of how much psychologically taxing such effort is. He was looking for advices from me, I’m not sure to be in the position of giving advices, however I told him I would write a blog post about what I think about the matter. Several weeks passed, and multiple times I started writing such post and stopped, because I didn’t had the time to process the ideas for enough time. Now I think I was able to analyze myself to find answers inside my own weakness, struggles, and desire of freedom, that inevitably invades the human minds when they do some task, that also has some negative aspect, for a prolonged amount of time. Maintaining an open source project is also a lot of joy and fun and these latest ten years of my professional life are surely memorable, even if not the absolute best (I had more fun during my startup times after all). However here I’ll focus on the negative side; simply make sure you don’t get the feeling it is just that, there is also a lot of good in it.

Flood effect

I don’t believe in acting fast, thinking fast, winning the competition on time and stuff like that. I don’t like the world of constant lack of focus we live in, because of social networks, chats, emails, and a schedule full of activities. So when I used to receive an email about Redis back in the early times of the project, when I still had plenty of time, I was able to focus on what the author of the message was trying to tell me. Then I could recall the relevant part of Redis we were discussing, and finally reply with my real thoughts, after considering the matter with care. I believe this is how most people should work regardless of what their job is.

When a software project reaches the popularity Redis reached, and at the same time once the communications between individuals are made so simple by the new social tools, and by your attitude to be “there” for users, the amount of messages, issues, pull requests, suggestions the authors receive will grow exponentially. At the same time, at least in the case of Redis, but I believe this to be a common problem, the amount of very qualified people that can look at such inputs from the community grows very slowly. This creates an obvious congestion. Most people try to address it in the wrong way: using pragmatism. Let’s close the issue after two weeks of no original poster replies, after we ask some question. Close all the issues that are not very well specified. And other “inbox zero” solutions. The reality is that to process community feedbacks very well you have to take the time needed, otherwise you will just pretend your project has a small number of open issues. Having a lot of resources to hire core-level experts for each Redis subsystem, to work at OSS full time, would work but is not feasible.

So what happens? That you start to prioritize more and more what to look at and what not. And you feel you are a piece of shit at ignoring so many things and people, and also the contributor believes you don’t care about what others have to give you. It’s a complex situation. Usually the end result is to develop an attitude to mostly address critical issues and disregard all the new stuff, since new stuff are yet not in the core, and who wants to have a larger code base with even more PRs and issues there? Maybe also written in a more convoluted way compared to your usual programming style, so, more complexity, and good luck when there is a critical bug there to track the root cause.

Role shifting

As a result of the “flood effect” problem exposed above, you suddenly also change job. Redis became popular because I supposedly am able to design and write software. And now instead most of the work I do is to look at issues and pull requests, and I also feel that I could do better many of the contributions I receive. Some will be better quality than I could do, because there are also better programmers than me contributing to Redis, but *most* for the nature of big numbers will be average contributions that are just written to solve a given problem that was contingent for the folks that submitted it. While, when I design for Redis, I tend to think at Redis as a whole, because it’s years I write this thing. So what you were good at, you have no longer time to do. This in turn means less organic big new features. My solution with that? Sometimes I just stop looking at issues and PRs for weeks, because I’m coding or designing: that is the work I really love and enjoy. However this in turn creates ways more pressure on me, psychologically. To do what I love and I can do well I’ve to feel like shit.

Time

There are two problems related to working at the same project for a prolonged amount of time, at least for me.
First, before of the Redis experience I *never* worked every week day of my life. I could work one week, stop two, then work one month, then disappear for other two months. Always. People need to recharge, get new energy and ideas, to do creative work. And programming at high level is a fucking creative job. Redis itself was created like that for the first two years, that is, when the project evolved at the fastest speed. Because the sum of the productivity of me working just when I want is greater than the productivity I’ve when I’m forced to work every day in a steady way.

However my work ethics allowed me to have a very discontinue schedule when I was working alone with my companies. Once I started to receive money to work at Redis, it was no longer possible for my ethics to have my past pattern, so I started to force myself to work under normal schedules. This for me is a huge struggle, for many years at this point. Moreover I’m sure I’m doing less than I could because of that, but this is how things work. I never found a way to solve this problem. I could say Redis Labs that I want to return to my old schedule, but that would not work because at this point I really “report” to the community, not to the company.

Another problem is that working a lot at the same project is also a complex matter, mentally speaking. I used to change project every six months in the past. Now for ten years I did the same thing. In that regard I tried to save my sanity by having sub-projects inside Redis. One time I did Cluster, another time disk-storage (now abandoned), another was HyerLogLogs, and so forth. Basically things that bring value to the project but that, in isolation, are other stuff. But eventually you have to return back to the issues and PRs page and address the same things every day. “Replica is disconnecting because of a timeout” or whatever. Let’s investigate that again.

Fear

I always had some fear to lose the technological leadership of the project. Not because I think I’m not good enough at designing and evolving Redis, but because I know my ways are not aligned with: 1) what a sizable amount of users want. 2) what most people in IT believe software is. So I had to constantly balance between what I believe to be good design, set of features, speed of development (slow), size of the project (minimal), and what I was expected to deliver by most of the user base. Fortunately there is a percentage of Redis users that understand perfectly the Redis-way, so at least from time to time I can get some word of comfort.

Frictions

Certain people are total assholes. They are everywhere, it is natural and if you ask me, I even believe in programming there are a lot more nice people than in other fields. But yet you’ll always see a percentage of total jerks. As the leader of a popular OSS project, in one way or the other you’ll have to confront with these people, and that’s maybe one of the most stressful things I ever did in the course of the Redis development.

Futileness

Sometimes I believe that software, while great, will never be huge like writing a book that will survive for centuries. Note because it is not as great per-se, but because as a side effect it is also useful… and will be replaced when something more useful is around. I would like to have time to do other activities as well. So sometimes I believe all I’m doing is, in the end, futile. We’ll design and write systems, and new systems will emerge; but anyone that just stays in software, instead of staying in “software big ideas”, will ever set a new mark? From time to time I think I had potentially the ability to work at big ideas but because I focused on writing software instead of thinking about software, I was not able to use my potential in that regard. This is basically the contrary of the impostor syndrome, so I guess I’ve a big idea of myself: sorry for that I should be more humble.

That said, I was able to work for many years doing things I really loved, that gave me friends, recognition, money, so I don’t want to say it was a bad deal. Yet I totally understand people struggling a lot to stay afloat once their projects start to be popular. This blog post is dedicated to them.

<description>&lt;header class=&quot;blog-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;blog-readingtime&quot;&gt;2 minute read.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blog-author&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/pastaduck&quot;&gt;Paul Anthony&lt;/a&gt; / May 16, 2019&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;article readability=&quot;39.135007105637&quot;&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;blog-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;blog-category&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posted in:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webdistortion.com/category/opinion/&quot; rel=&quot;category tag&quot;&gt;Opinion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium is cancer. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webdistortion.com/2015/10/13/is-medium-just-another-trojan-horse-social-platform/&quot;&gt;trojan horse&lt;/a&gt;. It’s Facebook. But for blogging. A walled garden behind which all your favourite content lives, and yet you are forced to login via their shitty UI, or worse still pay for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did reading stuff on the web become pay to play?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll tell you when. When we all got greedy looking for the attention our blogs &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to get until social media came along. Or when we got greedy looking for coinage off the onetruecontentsource™. If you enjoy reading on the web chances are you’ve been forced to login to Medium at some point in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have any of you noticed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/907266693638041600&quot;&gt;dark UI patterns&lt;/a&gt;. I bet you did. I’m guessing you noticed smart &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/1127981912755040256&quot;&gt;programmers&lt;/a&gt;  / &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MichaelAleo/status/1127986056849182720&quot;&gt;designers&lt;/a&gt; / internet celebs tweeting about how shit it is. Maybe someone you respect continually &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aardrian/status/1048265494858481664&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; their accessibility failures. Maybe you nodded your head in agreement. Maybe you even retweeted it. Go you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so we are clear. Medium takes your content, rolls it up into a pretty SEO friendly package for themselves and sells it. Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlternativeStr8/status/1129073256265338880&quot;&gt;turns us all into seals&lt;/a&gt; waiting for someone to throw us a fish in the process. If you are lucky, you might even get a cut. You know. Like the sort of cut artists get on Spotify. Profit share I think the cool kids call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is everyone still publishing on it? For what? More eyeballs? More attention? More reach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balls to that. If only one of you read this I’ll be happy. At least I own my own platform and I’m not being controlled by some monolithic publishing giant that can do &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoshuaRowe11/status/1128859059099062272&quot;&gt;whatever they want&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webdistortion.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-16-at-23.51.53.png&quot;&gt;sell whatever advertising they please&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ON YOUR HARD WORK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please. It’s 2019. Learn to market yourself and your content. Quit being lazy waiting for Medium to do it for you. &lt;strong&gt;OWN YOUR PLATFORM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don’t get me started on the mini publications that we all jump for fucking joy over being published on. How’s about no. How’s about we starting taking responsibility for the absolute decimation of the traditional web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know. That old internet that used to be open and free.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I.M. Pei has died</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/obituaries/im-pei-dead.html</link>

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;I. M. Pei, who began his long career designing buildings for a New York real estate developer and ended it as one of the most revered architects in the world, died early Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 102.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His death was confirmed by his son Li Chung Pei, who is also an architect and known as Sandi. He said his father had recently celebrated his birthday with a family dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Best known for designing the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/29/arts/pei-pyramid-and-new-louvre-open-today.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;glass pyramid at the entrance to the Louvre&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, Mr. Pei was one of the few architects who were equally attractive to real estate developers, corporate chieftains and art museum boards (the third group, of course, often made up of members of the first two). And all of his work — from his commercial skyscrapers to his art museums — represented a careful balance of the cutting edge and the conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei’s addition to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, known as the East Building, is made from massive blocks of Tennessee marble arranged around a triangular courtyard. It was a rare example of a modernist structure that appeared so permanent and well crafted that even lovers of traditional architecture were smitten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carol M.

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei remained a committed modernist, and while none of his buildings could ever be called old-fashioned or traditional, his particular brand of modernism — clean, reserved, sharp-edged and unapologetic in its use of simple geometries and its aspirations to monumentality — sometimes seemed to be a throwback, at least when compared with the latest architectural trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This hardly bothered him. What he valued most in architecture, he said, was that it “stand the test of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He maintained that he wanted not just to solve problems but also to produce “an architecture of ideas.” He worried, he added, “that ideas and professional practice do not intersect enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei, who was born in China and moved to the United States in the 1930s, was hired by William Zeckendorf in 1948, shortly after he received his graduate degree in architecture from Harvard, to oversee the design of buildings produced by Zeckendorf’s firm, Webb &amp;amp; Knapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;President Jimmy Carter dedicated the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1978. He was joined by, from left, Carter Brown, director of the gallery; Mr. Pei; Bunny Mellon, whose family donated money for the structure; and Joan Mondale, wife of Vice President Walter F.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At a time when most of his Harvard classmates considered themselves fortunate to get to design a single-family house or two, Mr. Pei quickly found himself engaged in the design of high-rise buildings, and he used that experience as a springboard to establish his own firm, I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates, which he set up in 1955 with Henry Cobb and Eason Leonard, the team he had assembled at Webb &amp;amp; Knapp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In its early years, I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates mainly executed projects for Zeckendorf, including Kips Bay Plaza in New York, finished in 1963; Society Hill Towers in Philadelphia (1964); and Silver Towers in New York (1967). All were notable for their gridded concrete facades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The firm became fully independent from Webb &amp;amp; Knapp in 1960, by which time Mr. Pei, a cultivated man whose understated manner and easy charm masked an intense, competitive ambition, was winning commissions for major projects that had nothing to do with Zeckendorf. Among these were the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., completed in 1967, and the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse and the Des Moines Art Center, both finished in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They were the first in a series of museums he designed that would come to include the East Building (1978) and the Louvre pyramid (1989) as well as the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/arts/architecture-view-a-shrine-to-rock-music-with-a-roll-all-its-own.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, for which he designed what amounted to a huge glass tent in 1995. It was perhaps his most surprising commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The National Gallery project helped Mr. Pei win the commission to renovate the Louvre in Paris. The 70-foot-high glass pyramid appalled preservationists, but the public eventually warmed to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Claude Paris/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei, not a rock ’n’ roll fan, initially turned down that job. After he changed his mind, he prepared for the challenge of expressing the spirit of the music by traveling to rock concerts with Jann Wenner, the publisher of Rolling Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Cleveland project would not be Mr. Pei’s last unlikely museum commission: His museum oeuvre would culminate in the call to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/arts/design/14ouro.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;design the Museum of Islamic Art&lt;/a&gt;, in Doha, Qatar, in 2008, a challenge Mr. Pei accepted with relish. A longtime collector of Western Abstract Expressionist art, he admitted to knowing little about Islamic art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As with the rock museum, Mr. Pei saw the Qatar commission as an opportunity to learn about a culture he did not claim to understand. He began his research by reading a biography of the Prophet Muhammad, and then commenced a tour of great Islamic architecture around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-872od7 eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-5ebf9f91&quot;&gt;Bold Yet Pragmatic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While the waffle-like concrete facades of the Zeckendorf buildings were an early signature of his, Mr. Pei soon moved beyond concrete to a more sculptural but equally modernist approach. Throughout his long career he combined a willingness to use bold, assertive forms with a pragmatism born in his years with Zeckendorf, and he alternated between designing commercial projects and making a name for himself in other architectural realms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Besides his many art museums, he designed concert halls, academic structures, hospitals, office towers and civic buildings like the Dallas City Hall, completed in 1977; the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, finished in 1979; and the Guggenheim Pavilion of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, finished in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;(I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates eventually became I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Partners and later named Pei, Cobb and Freed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Mr. Pei was invited to design the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, he had the opportunity to demonstrate his belief that modernism was capable of producing buildings with the gravitas, the sense of permanence and the popular appeal of the greatest traditional structures. When the building opened in 1978, Ada Louise Huxtable, the senior architecture critic of The New York Times, hailed it as the most important building of the era, and she called Mr. Pei, at least by implication, the pre-eminent architect of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most other critics also praised Mr. Pei’s angular structure of glass and marble, constructed out of the same Tennessee marble as John Russell Pope’s original National Gallery Building of 1941, reshaped into a building of crisp, angular forms set around a triangular courtyard. Mr. Pei, many critics said, had found a way to get beyond both the casual, temporal air and the coldness of much modern architecture, and to create a building that was both boldly monumental and warmly inviting, even exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The Bank of China building, center, in Hong Kong was designed by Mr. Pei to look like an angular bamboo shoot. It was completed in 1989.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jerome Favre/EPA, via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1979, the year after the National Gallery was completed, Mr. Pei received the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects, its highest honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the same time that he was receiving plaudits in Washington, however, Mr. Pei was recovering from one of the most devastating setbacks any architect of his generation had faced anywhere: the nearly total failure of one of his most conspicuous projects, the 700-foot-tall John Hancock Tower at Copley Square in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A thin, elegant slab of bluish glass designed by his partner Henry Cobb, it was nearing completion in 1973 when sheets of glass began popping out of its facade. They were quickly replaced with plywood, but before the source of the problem could be detected, nearly a third of the glass had fallen out, creating both a professional embarrassment and an enormous legal liability for Mr. Pei and his firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The fault, experts believed, was not in the Pei design but in the glass itself: The Hancock Tower was one of the first high-rise buildings to use a new type of reflective, double-paned glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei was far from the obvious choice to design the Kennedy library and museum, but when Jacqueline Kennedy visited him in his office in 1964, she was so impressed by his erudition and elegant manners that she chose him on the spot. At a meeting of trustees and directors of the library, Mr. Pei shared a laugh with Mrs. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eddie Hausner/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The building ultimately won numerous awards, including the American Institute of Architects’ 25-Year Award. But it took eight years of legal wrangling, millions of dollars and the replacement of all 10,344 panes of glass in the facade before the Hancock’s troubles could be put to rest and the building could be appreciated as one of the most beautiful skyscrapers of the late 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The problems delayed its opening by three years, its temporary plywood windows a constant reminder to all Boston of its troubles, which cost I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Partners so many clients that Mr. Pei almost had to close the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The glass company had a lot of money, and Hancock had a lot of money, but we didn’t have a lot of money,” he told The Times in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The long struggle to resolve the problems at the Hancock, and the fallout from the crisis, made the 1970s, despite the triumph of the National Gallery in Washington, a bittersweet decade for Mr. Pei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-872od7 eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-13e1f92c&quot;&gt;Son of a Banker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ieoh Ming Pei was born in Canton (now Guangzhou) on April 26, 1917, the son of Tsuyee Pei, one of China’s leading bankers. When he was an infant, his father moved the family to Hong Kong to assume the head position at the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China, and when Ieoh Ming was 9, his father was put in charge of the larger branch in Shanghai. He remembered being fascinated by the construction of a 25-story hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I couldn’t resist looking into the hole,” he recalled in 2007. “That’s when I knew I wanted to build.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Deciding to attend college in the United States, he enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. But when he concluded that he was not up to the classical drawing techniques then being taught at Penn, he transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he received a bachelor of architecture degree in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At the recommendation of his father, who was concerned about the threat of war and the growing possibility of a Communist revolution in China, he postponed his plan to return home. Instead he enrolled at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard, where he studied under the German modernist architect Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Discovering that there were relatively few men at Harvard during the war years — “It was me, a Chinese national, and the ladies,” he once recalled — he decided to join the war effort and volunteered to work for the National Defense Research Committee in Princeton, N.J., where he became an expert on fusing bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“They figured if you knew how to build buildings, you knew how to destroy them,” Mr. Pei said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While he was at M.I.T., Mr. Pei met another Chinese national, Eileen Loo, who had come to the United States in 1938 to study art at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Like Mr. Pei, she was from a distinguished Chinese family. The two married as soon as she graduated, in 1942. Eileen Pei began graduate work in landscape architecture at Harvard while her husband worked toward his advanced architecture degree, which he received in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei designed large, publicly subsidized projects like Kips Bay Towers (1963), a Manhattan complex whose gridded, poured-in-place concrete facades proved, he said, that concrete was an acceptable material for large-scale urban housing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bob Glass/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He taught briefly at Harvard and planned to return to China in time. But then he was approached by Zeckendorf, who was looking for a talented young architect to head a new in-house design team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei, refined and genteel, could not have been more different on the surface from the brash Zeckendorf. But the men shared a bold ambition, a love of French wine and a belief that architecture could improve cities. Mr. Pei decided to make the move to New York. He, his wife and their two young sons left Cambridge, Mass., and settled in an apartment on Beekman Place in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Zeckendorf years were a heady beginning for Mr. Pei’s career. Before long he had hired one of his former students at Harvard, Henry Cobb, who would remain associated with him for more than 60 years. The architect Ulrich Franzen also began his career working under Mr. Pei at Webb &amp;amp; Knapp, where the architecture department had charge of large-scale projects in New York, Washington, Montreal, Denver, Boston and other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;No matter how committed William Zeckendorf was to Mr. Pei’s designs, however, he was still a commercial real estate developer, and Mr. Pei did not want to spend his entire career working for someone else. With Zeckendorf’s blessing he began to seek some outside commissions, including the Luce Memorial Chapel in Taiwan and the Green Earth Sciences building at M.I.T., and he gradually began to separate himself from his patron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;One of Mr. Pei’s earliest works was The Silver Towers at New York University, part of what he called his “concrete series.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Zeckendorf’s empire ran into serious financial problems in 1960, that became a good excuse to turn I. M. Pei &amp;amp; Associates into a fully independent firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-872od7 eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-410eb51&quot;&gt;The Choice of the Kennedys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei quickly began to gather both large and small architectural assignments, among them the National Airlines terminal at what is now John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, the Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University, and the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library in Columbus, Ind., a city famous for its architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the commission that truly thrust Mr. Pei into the forefront of American architects was for a building that would take 15 years to build and would bring him a sense of triumph and frustration in equal parts: the John F. Kennedy Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was chosen in 1964 by Jacqueline Kennedy (later Onassis), who liked the fact that he was young — he and John F. Kennedy were born just a month apart — and only beginning to come into his own. His selection over Louis Kahn, Philip Johnson, Gordon Bunshaft and Paul Rudolph made it clear that he was no longer viewed as a developer’s architect but as a major talent on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But political objections to the library’s original site in Cambridge delayed the project for years, and by the time it was built, both the new site, at Columbia Point in Boston Harbor, and the scaled-down design represented major compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;During the years the Kennedy Library was being planned, the Pei firm grew rapidly. There were still more museums, like the Herbert F. Johnson Museum at Cornell University, and large urban complexes like the Christian Science Center in Boston, as well as the project that would bring Mr. Pei his greatest notoriety in Boston, the John Hancock Tower, and the museum that would bring him his greatest acclaim, the East Building of the National Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As his firm grew in size and prestige — it would eventually employ 300 people — Mr. Pei seemed to become the quintessential New Yorker. He and his wife and family, which grew to include three sons and a daughter, moved to a townhouse on Sutton Place, facing the East River, where he remained for the rest of his life. He became an avid collector of postwar American art, and his townhouse contained works by Morris Louis, Dubuffet and de Kooning; he also designed a weekend house for his family in Katonah, N.Y., in Westchester County, where he installed a 16-foot-high sculpture by Anthony Caro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei never played down his connections to China. His children were all given Chinese names, and when he won the Pritzker Prize in 1983, widely viewed as the highest honor a living architect can receive, he used the $100,000 award to establish a scholarship fund for Chinese architecture students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His eldest son, T’ing Chung, an urban planner, died in 2003. His wife of 72 years, Eileen, died in 2014. In addition to his son Li Chung, who is known as Sandi, he is survived by another son, Chien Chung, also an architect, who is known as Didi; his daughter, Liane; and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei’s younger sons joined with him to form their own firm, the Pei Partnership, in 1992, at which point I. M. Pei began stepping aside from the firm he had founded and devoted most of the last years of his career to working with his sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He did not go back to China until 1974, when he returned as part of a cultural exchange tour organized by the American Institute of Architects. There, he did not hesitate to criticize the banal, Soviet-influenced architecture that he saw, and he gave a talk in which he urged the Chinese to look back at their own traditions rather than “slavishly following Eastern European patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The criticism did not deter the Chinese government from inviting Mr. Pei, by then the most famous Chinese-born architect in the world, back again, this time to design a group of high-rise hotels in the center of Beijing. He declined, saying that he feared such buildings would deface the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;In 1992, Mr. Pei began working with his sons Chien Chung Pei, known as Didi, and Li Chung Pei, known as Sandi, at Pei Partnership Architects. Among their most visible projects was the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hassan Ammar/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The government, not willing to let him get away so easily, then offered him a rural site outside the city and asked him to design a resort hotel there. This time he said yes, and produced the design for Fragrant Hill, a sprawling building in which he tried to combine the geometric modernism of his other buildings with elements from traditional Chinese architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was the first of a few attempts Mr. Pei made to acknowledge the growing interest of many architects in reusing historical form; in a similar vein, he would later design a high-rise hotel in Midtown Manhattan, the Regent (now the Four Seasons), which tried to evoke the romantic, stepped-back forms of prewar New York skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The opening of Fragrant Hill was a major international event. Jacqueline Onassis, whose friendship with Mr. Pei remained strong throughout the years of delay over the Kennedy Library, attended, as did Carter Brown, the director of the National Gallery. But Mr. Pei later admitted that he considered the building, which was poorly constructed and not well maintained, a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1982, Mr. Pei would have a very different kind of opportunity in China when the governors of the Bank of China in Hong Kong, the bank his father had once run, traveled to New York to meet with Tsuyee Pei, who had long since left China and was living in Manhattan. Their mission was to ask the senior Pei, in a demonstration of traditional Chinese etiquette, if he would agree to allow them to invite his son to design a new skyscraper headquarters for the bank in Hong Kong. (Tsuyee Pei was bitterly opposed to the Communist Chinese government, but he did not stand in the way of his son’s taking the job.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei and his wife, Eileen, with Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker at an awards ceremony in Luxembourg in 2006. The couple married in 1942 and had four children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harald Tittel/picture-alliance and dpa, via Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It would turn out to be one of Mr. Pei’s most notable towers, a narrow 70-story composition of triangular and diamond shapes, built of glass and steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-872od7 eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-752d57b5&quot;&gt;A Pyramid as a Portal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei would make his biggest international mark, however, in France, with a smaller but far more contentious project. In the early 1980s President François Mitterand, an admirer of the East Building at the National Gallery, invited Mr. Pei to update and expand the Louvre Museum, which was sorely in need of renovation to accommodate a huge increase in visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei proposed building a glass pyramid in the center of the ancient Cour Napoleon to serve as a new main entrance to the museum. He quickly found himself in the center of an international controversy, accused of defacing one of the world’s great landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He argued that his glass pyramid was merely an updated version of a traditional form, and that his redesigned courtyard had been influenced by the geometric work of the French landscape architect Le Notre. It was rigorously rational, in other words, and in that sense classically French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-79elbk&quot; data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mr. Pei in his Sutton Place home in Manhattan in 2008. As a boy in Shanghai, he was fascinated by the construction of a 25-story hotel. “I couldn’t resist looking into the hole,” he recalled. “That’s when I decided I wanted to build.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tony Cenicola/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;What carried the day, however, was not Mr. Pei’s argument, true as it may have been, but President Mitterand’s determination. The pyramid opened in the spring of 1989, and the elegance of the finished building, not to mention its geometric precision, won over most, if not all, of its opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Within a few years the pyramid had become an accepted, and generally admired, symbol of a re-energized Paris. And like the Kennedy Library, the John Hancock Tower and another controversial Pei project from the 1980s, the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York, it stood as a measure not just of I. M. Pei’s design talent but also of his patience and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In retirement, Mr. Pei remained eager for news of both architecture and art and, until his last year, continued to make the occasional trip downtown to lunch with friends and consume his share of red Bordeaux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His 100th birthday, in 2017, was marked with an elaborate black-tie dinner, given by his children, at the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, where he was toasted by many of the world’s leading architects, some of whom had begun their careers working for him, and a circle of friends that included prominent members of the Chinese community in the United States, who considered him among their most eminent figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As he blew out the candles on an enormous cake in the angular shape of the monumental Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, his last major building project, Mr. Pei beamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>U.S. cancels $929M in California high speed rail funds after appeal rejected</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-rail/u-s-cancels-929-million-in-california-high-speed-rail-funds-after-appeal-rejected-idUSKCN1SM2F9</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Thursday it was formally cancelling $929 million in previously awarded funding for California’s high-speed rail program after rejecting an appeal by the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20190516&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1387845551&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEF4F1HD&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;FILE PHOTO - California Governor Jerry Brown's name and others are pictured on a railroad rail after a ceremony for the California High Speed Rail in Fresno, California January 6, 2015.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. railway regulator, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), said on Thursday it had canceled the funding awarded in a 2010 agreement after it said the state had “repeatedly failed to comply” and “failed to make reasonable progress on the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the FRA said it was still considering “all options” on seeking the return of $2.5 billion in federal funds the state has already received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision is the latest salvo in an ongoing battle between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and California over a series of issues including immigration, vehicle emissions standards and internet policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. state has repeatedly sued the Trump administration and officials expect the state will sue over the rescinding of rail funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration moved to end funding after California Governor Gavin Newsom said in February the state would scale back the planned $77.3 billion high-speed rail project after cost hikes, delays and management concerns, but would finish a smaller section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Thursday, Newsom called the action “illegal and a direct assault on California, our green infrastructure, and the thousands of Central Valley workers who are building this project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added “the Trump Administration is trying to exact political retribution on our state,” and vowed to go to court to protect “California’s money, appropriated by Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic-choked state had planned to build a 520-mile (837-km) system in the first phase that would allow trains to travel at up to 220 miles per hour (354 kph) from Los Angeles to San Francisco and begin full operations by 2033.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsom said in February the state would instead complete a 119-mile high-speed link between Merced and Bakersfield in the state’s Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who overseas FRA, in February said California’s drastically scaled back rail project “is a classic example of bait and switch... We have a right to ask for that $2.5 billion back as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state said in March that ending funding “would cause massive disruption, dislocation, and waste, damaging the region and endangering the future of high-speed rail in California.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration awarded California $3.5 billion in 2010 and California voters in 2008 approved nearly $10 billion in bond proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2018, the state forecast project costs had jumped $13 billion to $77 billion and warned costs could be as much as $98.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook has struggled to hire talent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/16/facebook-has-struggled-to-recruit-since-cambridge-analytica-scandal.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/16/facebook-has-struggled-to-recruit-since-cambridge-analytica-scandal.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is still reeling from the fallout from its Cambridge Analytica scandal more than a year ago, as multiple former recruiters say candidates are turning down job offers from what was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/facebook-is-no-longer-glassdoors-best-place-to-work.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;once considered&lt;/a&gt; the best place to work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half a dozen recruiters who left Facebook in recent months told CNBC that the tech company experienced a significant decrease in job offer acceptance rates after the March 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a data firm improperly accessed the data of 87 million Facebook users and used it to target ads for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This impact to Facebook's recruiting efforts is important as the company adds thousands of employees each year. These new workers are key to the company's ability to innovate and improve its existing products. The company faces cutthroat competition for talent from other top tech companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and countless start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, Facebook saw a sharp increase in students at top universities who are declining the company's job offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among top schools, such as Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Ivy League universities, Facebook’s acceptance rate for full-time positions offered to new graduates has fallen from an average of 85% for the 2017-2018 school year to between 35% and 55% as of December, according to former Facebook recruiters. The biggest decline came from Carnegie Mellon University, where the acceptance rate for new recruits dropped to 35%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drop has been echoed elsewhere in the company's recruiting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has seen a decline in acceptance rates among software engineer candidates for its product teams. Those teams have seen their acceptance rates fall from nearly 90% in late 2016 to almost 50% in early 2019, according to one recruiter who left recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook spokesperson Anthony Harrison said the company's head count grew 36% year over year from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. Facebook disputed the accuracy of the recruiters' accounts, but declined to point out any specific points that were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the publication of this story, Harrison contacted CNBC to say &quot;these numbers are totally wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Facebook regularly ranks high on industry lists of most attractive employers,&quot; Harrison said in a statement. &quot;For example, in the last year we were rated as #1 on Indeed's Top Rated Workplaces, #2 on LinkedIn's Top Companies, and #7 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work. Our annual intern survey showed exceptionally strong sentiment and intent to return and we continue to see strong acceptance rates across University Recruiting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, Facebook candidates are asking much tougher questions about the company's approach to privacy, according to multiple former recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decline has put pressure on Facebook recruiters to fill a backlog of open positions under more difficult pressures than they've faced previously, the recruiters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Usually half of the close is done for recruiters with the brand Facebook has,&quot; one recruiter who left in 2019 said. &quot;This is the first time a lot of our folks have had to be on top of their game to make sure top candidates don't slip through the cracks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drop in candidate interest follows other signs that show more tech workers are reconsidering working for Facebook. In December, former Facebook employees told CNBC that they were hearing from more current Facebook employees who were reaching out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/02/facebook-employees-calling-former-colleagues-to-look-for-jobs-outside.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;ask about job opportunities elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. And in April, executives at health-tech start-ups told CNBC that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/facebook-google-scandals-ease-recruiting-for-health-start-ups.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;poaching employees from Facebook has become easier&lt;/a&gt; after the company's scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandals have impacted candidate interest and have hurt morale among recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The biggest thing that impacted people at Facebook is that we found out information at the same time as the general public did,&quot; one recruiter who left recently said. &quot;It was like, 'Wait, shouldn't one of our leaders have told us about this first versus our parents or friends reaching out?' It was a shock.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has lost candidates to other top companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can offer salaries and signing bonuses as good as Facebook's with much less scandal, recruiters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has also lost candidates to start-ups that are gearing up to go public or have just gone public, such as Airbnb, Slack, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UBER&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=LYFT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;, the former recruiters said. Several candidates have also opted for high-potential start-ups, including Robinhood and Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's scandals are not the only reason for Facebook's new recruiting struggles, the recruiters said. There are a number of other reasons, including the skyrocketing cost of living in the Bay Area and the cutthroat competition for talent among top tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some candidates have said they're not interested due to concerns about the general culture of the company as well as its leadership. Others still say they don't want to be involved with the company that was responsible for electing President Donald Trump or that they don't want to work for a company that has Peter Thiel, a notable investor and staunch Trump supporter, on its board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other candidates, especially students, are also passing on Facebook's offers because they simply don't use the company's apps as much as previous generations and are therefore less inspired to work for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The privacy scandals, the Cambridge Analytica stuff — students aren't as interested in going to Facebook anymore,&quot; a former Facebook university recruiter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/how-to-see-which-facebook-apps-have-access-to-your-data.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here's how to see which apps have access to your Facebook data — and cut them off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zero Cost Abstractions</title>
<link>https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/zero-cost-abstractions/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of a &lt;strong&gt;zero cost abstraction&lt;/strong&gt; is very important to certain programming languages, like Rust and C++, which intend to enable users to write programs with excellent performance profiles with relatively little effort. Since this idea is fundamental to the design of Rust and my work, I want to investigate, for a moment, what exactly a zero cost abstraction even is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is summarized in its original by Bjarne Stroustrup, the original developer of C++:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you don’t use, you don’t pay for. And further: What you do use, you couldn’t hand code any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this definition, there are two factors that make something a proper zero cost abstraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No global costs:&lt;/strong&gt; A zero cost abstraction ought not to negatively impact the performance of programs that don’t use it. For example, it can’t require every program carry a heavy language runtime to benefit the only programs that use the feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimal performance:&lt;/strong&gt; A zero cost abstractoin ought to compile to the best implementation of the solution that someone would have written with the lower level primitives. It can’t introduce additional costs that could be avoided without the abstraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I think its important to keep in mind that there is a third requirement for something to be a zero cost abstraction. It’s often overlooked because its simply a requirement of all good abstractions, zero cost or not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve users’ experience:&lt;/strong&gt; The point of abstraction is to provide a new tool, assembled from lower level components, which enable users to more easily write the programs they want ot write. A zero cost abstraction, like all abstractions, must actually offer a better experience than the alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these are of course ideals that can never be fully realized, and this third in particular, well - there’s no accounting for taste. But for zero cost abstractions, the third point is actually especially important, because zero cost abstractions are competing with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; different alternatives. On the one hand, it must be better than handwriting code with the same performance profile yourself, that’s rather clear. But on the other, it must also be better than eating the performance cost and using an abstraction which isn’t zero cost. That doesn’t mean we need to be strictly better than the non-zero cost abstraction, because the performance cost is a factor, but we do have to be within spitting distance so that whatever additional programmer overhead you take on to be “zero cost” feels worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think to some extent Rust has tried to cheat this by making non-zero cost abstractions actively unpleasant to write, making it &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like the zero cost abstraction is better. I think this is a mistake that hurts the overall UX of the language and probably just keeps some people from using it at all, hurting our overall goals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say, also, that actually creating a zero cost abstraction that achieves this trifecta is both incredibly difficult and incredibly awesome. Rust has only really done this excellently a few times (all extremely high impact), and having been involved in what I think is going to be one of those success stories - async/await of course - it feels like holding fire in your hands. Last September I commented to a friend that I was worried I would never do any work as good as the work I had just done (in reference to the Pin API), and I really did feel that. But we rarely achieve something so great, because its extremely difficult and involves a fair amount of luck as well (many problems probably just don’t have a really great zero cost abstraction yet to be discovered, at least within the design constraints prior decisions have put around them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear about what I mean, I want to list a few of the really great zero cost abstractions in Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership and borrowing.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course this is the biggest one, guaranteed memory and thread safety without a garbage collector is Rust’s original, huge success story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterator and closure APIs.&lt;/strong&gt; This is another classic. While there are some cases where internal iteration might be optimized better, the fact that you can write map, filter, iterative for loops, and so on over slices and be optimized to the equivalent of some handwritten C is absolutely astounding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Async/await and Futures.&lt;/strong&gt; The Futures API is an important example, because the early versions of futures hit the “zero cost” part of zero cost abstraction really well, but was not actually providing a good enough UX to drive adoption. By adding pinning to support async/await, references across awaits, and so on, we’ve made a product that I really think will solve users’ problems and make Rust more viable for writing high performance network services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsafe and the module boundary.&lt;/strong&gt; Underlying all of these, and every one of Rust’s success stories, is the notion of unsafe blocks and privacy that allow us to dip into raw pointer manipulation to build these zero cost abstractions. None of Rust’s brilliant features would be possible without this really fundamental ability to break the rules locally to extend the system beyond what the typechecker can handle. This is the zero cost abstraction that is the mother of all other zero cost abstractions in Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other areas, we still haven’t succeeded so much at finding zero cost abstractions. One example of this is the trait object as a solution for dynamically dispatched polymorphism. (Note here that the dynamic dispatch is a part of the &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; here, so the virtual call is not non-zero cost.) The problem is that the concept of object safety, as well as sized and unsized types, and probably just some bad ergonomics around the coercions, has made trait objects really unwieldly to work with; I’m usually pretty annoyed when I have to use them. For a good 18 months at least I’ve wanted to really dig into this problem space, but other things have always taken priority.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sony and Microsoft set rivalry aside for cloud gaming alliance</title>
<link>https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Sony-and-Microsoft-set-rivalry-aside-for-streaming-alliance</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Sony-and-Microsoft-set-rivalry-aside-for-streaming-alliance</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TOKYO -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Sony-Corp&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft, bitter rivals in the video game console wars, will team up in on-demand gaming to better compete with newcomers like Google as the industry's main battlefield looks poised to shift to the cloud, Nikkei learned Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recent trip to the U.S., Sony President and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida signed a memorandum of understanding with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on a strategic tie-up. While details have yet to be hammered out, the partnership will center on artificial intelligence and the cloud, according to an announcement by Microsoft early Friday Japan time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter category includes plans for joint development of cloud gaming technology. While this market is expected to grow as ultrafast fifth-generation wireless gains traction, such services require much processing power on the provider's end to deliver games with high-quality graphics and minimal lag. Sony and Microsoft plan to leverage the American computing behemoth's data centers for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Nintendo-Co.-Ltd&quot;&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, long dominated the gaming landscape. But the rise of mobile gaming has brought competition from such other players as China's &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Tencent-Holdings-Ltd&quot;&gt;Tencent Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, which publishes the mobile version of the wildly popular PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moving onto their turf are big tech companies that already have the powerful server networks needed for effective streaming as well as massive built-in bases of potential customers. These include Google and its planned Stadia cloud gaming platform, as well as Apple, which announced the Apple Arcade subscription service in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of new rivals and technology spurred the Sony-Microsoft team-up, though it will not mean an end to the console wars. The PlayStation and Xbox brands will continue to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside gaming, the two companies will consider combining image sensors from Sony -- which controls half the global market -- with Microsoft AI technology to develop electronic &quot;eyes&quot; for self-driving vehicles. They will also discuss incorporating Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant into televisions, speakers and other Sony products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tie-up is an indication of Sony's shifting strategy. The Japanese company is focusing resources on areas where it can effectively use its strengths, such as games and image sensors, and becoming more open to partnerships in other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hopes to use the alliance to strengthen its cloud business and gain an edge over Google and Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time Sony and Microsoft have worked together. They announced collaborations in home electronics in 1998 and music distribution technology in 1999. This wider-ranging tie-up aims to help both compete more effectively in a fast-changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SAT to Add ‘Adversity Score’ That Rates Students’ Hardships</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/us/sat-adversity-score.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/us/sat-adversity-score.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The College Board, the company that administers the SAT exam taken by about two million students a year, will for the first time assess students not just on their math and verbal skills, but also on their educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, entering a fraught battle over the fairness of high-stakes testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company announced on Thursday that it will include a new rating, which is widely being referred to as an “adversity score,” of between 1 and 100 on students’ test results. An average score is 50, and higher numbers mean more disadvantage. The score will be calculated using 15 factors, including the relative quality of the student’s high school and the crime rate and poverty level of the student’s neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The rating will not affect students’ test scores, and will be reported only to college admissions officials as part of a larger package of data on each test taker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The new measurement brings the College Board squarely into the raging national debate over fairness and merit in college admissions, one fueled by enduring court clashes on affirmative action, a federal investigation into a sprawling admissions cheating ring and a booming college preparatory industry that promises results to those who can pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Colleges have long tried to bring diversity of all sorts to their student bodies, and they have raised concerns over whether the SAT, once seen as a test of merit, can be gamed by families who hire expensive consultants and tutors. Higher scores have been found to correlate with students from wealthier families and those with better-educated parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Merit is all about resourcefulness,” David Coleman, chief executive of the College Board, said in an interview on Thursday. “This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they’ve been given. It helps colleges see students who may not have scored as high, but when you look at the environment that they have emerged from, it is amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A growing number of colleges, in response to criticism of standardized tests, have made it optional for applicants to submit scores from the SAT or the ACT. Admissions officers have also tried for years to find ways to gauge the hardships that students have had to overcome, and to predict which students will do well in college despite lower test scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The new adversity score is meant to be one such gauge. It is part of a larger rating system called the Environmental Context Dashboard that the College Board will include in test results it reports to schools. A trial version of the tool has already been field-tested by 50 colleges. The plan to roll it out officially, to 150 schools this year and more widely in 2020, was &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/sat-to-give-students-adversity-score-to-capture-social-and-economic-background-11557999000&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first reported by The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the score met instantly with an array of criticisms, from worries that it created a new cast of winners and losers in the admissions process, to concerns that it papered over an inherently flawed test. College counselors said they were swamped with calls from parents on Thursday as word of the new measurement got out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Anxiety’s ratcheting up,” said Hafeez Lakhani, a college admissions coach in New York. “People are worried about never being good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He said he had received emails from parents asking whether their children’s hard work in preparing for the SAT “would be completely negated just because we happen to have some means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Lakhani said that in his view, colleges were already doing a good job of considering adversity, as indicated by rising numbers of first-generation and low-income students, especially at elite colleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Others felt that the College Board’s efforts were misplaced. Robert Schaeffer, the public education director of FairTest, a group that is critical of standardized testing, said that if the SAT needed a sophisticated contextual framework to make it valid, then “it’s a concession that it’s not a good test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He added that the adversity score would not capture individual situations, like a child who was middle class but whose mother was addicted to opioids. “Mentally adjusting scores based on where a student came from and what obstacles she overcame is common practice,” Mr. Schaeffer said. “It’s this attempt to do it in a quantitative manner that opens up many other issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;News of the plan comes amid a sweeping college admissions scandal, in which 50 people across multiple states have been charged. Prosecutors said the scheme included tactics like fraudulently obtaining extra time on ACT or SAT tests, changing test answers and having a ringer take exams for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;[&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/georgetown-expels-students.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;A student whose father paid $400,000 to get him into Georgetown is now suing the school for threatening to expel him&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Universities like Harvard, Yale, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Texas at Austin are also facing challenges to their affirmative action policies, either in the courts or through federal investigations. Many schools are preparing for the possibility that a newly conservative Supreme Court will take a hard line on the use of race in admissions decisions. The College Board says race is not factored into adversity scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;David Hawkins, the executive director for educational content and policy at the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said he believed that overworked admissions officers would welcome a more standardized measure of hardship and disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think this is done with at least one eye to the legal considerations that admissions officers are subjected to, the long history of lawsuits about race and ethnicity,” Mr. Hawkins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Adam Mortara, a lawyer for Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing Harvard for what it says are discriminatory practices against Asian applicants, said he saw the adversity measure as a viable alternative to race-conscious admissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“This is what will give them a tool to achieve true diversity when and if they decide to stop using race, or if we’re ultimately successful in getting race out of admissions,” Mr. Mortara said, adding that he was speaking for himself, not his client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Read about Harvard’s once-secret admissions process, which was unveiled in an affirmative action trial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yale has used the College Board’s new tool for two admissions cycles, said Jeremiah Quinlan, the dean of undergraduate admissions. He said it provided the same context that Yale has been looking at for decades, but does so in a standardized way across schools and applicants that is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There’s nothing wrong with the SAT score,” Mr. Quinlan said. “It just helps contextualize the SAT score for us. When you’re able to see a student’s SAT score and then compare it to the SAT scores of the other students at the school, that can be powerful to identify a truly transcendent student.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He added, however, that while Yale was seeking race-neutral tools for admission, he did not think they were enough to replace the consideration of race in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The adversity score is based on data from the Census Bureau, crime data from the F.B.I., and other sources, College Board officials said. It accounts for circumstances like wealthier students going to magnet schools in poorer areas, as well as the reverse. But Mr. Coleman said that these were likely to be outliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It is much more common that poor people live in poor neighborhoods than the wealthy do,” Mr. Coleman said. “But growing up in a neighborhood with less violence gives you advantages in your academic work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Coleman said the tool ignored race because its premise was that race was less of a predictor of success at school than what he called resourcefulness. “It turns out in America that within every racial group — Asian, white, black, Latino — there are large numbers of people who show resourcefulness within very limited circumstances,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
