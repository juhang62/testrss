<title>EFF Wins Access to License Plate Reader Data to Study Law Enforcement Use</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/press/releases/victory-eff-wins-access-license-plate-reader-data-study-how-law-enforcement-uses</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/press/releases/victory-eff-wins-access-license-plate-reader-data-study-how-law-enforcement-uses</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;San Francisco—Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California (ACLU SoCal) have reached an agreement with Los Angeles law enforcement agencies under which the police and sheriff’s departments will turn over license plate data they indiscriminately collected on millions of law-abiding drivers in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, which has been deidentified to protect drivers’ privacy, will allow EFF and ACLU SoCal to learn how the agencies are using automated license plate reader (ALPR) systems throughout the city and county of Los Angeles and educate the public on the privacy risks posed by this intrusive technology. A weeks’ worth of data, composed of nearly 3 million data points, will be examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/alpr-presentation&quot;&gt;ALPR&lt;/a&gt; systems include cameras mounted on police cars and at fixed locations that scan every license plate that comes into view—up to 1,800 plates per minute. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr&quot;&gt;They record data&lt;/a&gt; on each plate, including the precise time, date, and place it was encountered. The two Los Angeles agencies scan about 3 million plates every week and store the data for years at a time. Using this data, police can learn where we were in the past and infer intimate details of our daily lives such as where we work and live, who our friends are, what religious or political activities we attend, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of vehicles across the country have had their license plates scanned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-reader-dataset&quot;&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;—and more than 99% of them weren’t associated with any crimes. Yet law enforcement agencies often share ALPR information with their counterparts in other jurisdictions, as well as with border agents,  airport security, and university police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EFF and ACLU SoCal reached the agreement with the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s Departments after winning a precedent-setting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/aclu-v-la-superior-court-ca-supreme-court-opinion&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 from the California Supreme Court in our public records lawsuit against the two agencies. The court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/press/releases/electronic-frontier-foundation-aclu-win-court-ruling-police-cant-keep-license-plate&quot;&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; that the data are not investigative records under the California Public Records Act that law enforcement can keep secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-reader-dataset&quot;&gt;six years&lt;/a&gt; of litigation, EFF and ACLU SoCal are finally getting access to millions of ALPR scans that will shed light on how the technology is being used, where it’s being used, and how it affects people’s privacy,” said EFF Surveillance Litigation Director Jennifer Lynch. “We persevered and won a tough battle against law enforcement agencies that wanted to keep this information from the public. We have a right to information about how government agencies are using high-tech systems to track our locations, surveil our neighborhoods, and collect private information without our knowledge and consent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Supreme Court ruling has significance beyond the ALPR case. It set a groundbreaking precedent that mass, indiscriminate data collection by the police can’t be withheld just because the information may contain some data related to criminal investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on this case:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/cases/automated-license-plate-readers-aclu-eff-v-lapd-lasd&quot;&gt;https://www.eff.org/cases/automated-license-plate-readers-aclu-eff-v-lapd-lasd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on ALPRs:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr&quot;&gt;https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>SQL queries don&amp;#039;t start with SELECT</title>
<link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/03/sql-queries-don-t-start-with-select/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/10/03/sql-queries-don-t-start-with-select/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, obviously many SQL queries do start with &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; (and actually this post is only about &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; queries, not &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;s or anything).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Yesterday I was working on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1179419244808851462?s=20&quot;&gt;explanation of window functions&lt;/a&gt;, and I found myself googling “can you filter based on the result of a window function”. As in – can you filter the result of a window function in a WHERE or HAVING or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I concluded “window functions must run after WHERE and GROUP BY happen, so you can’t do it”. But this led me to a bigger question – &lt;strong&gt;what order do SQL queries actually run in?&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was something that I felt like I knew intuitively (“I’ve written at least 10,000 SQL queries, some of them were really complicated! I must know this!“) but I struggled to actually articulate what the order was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sql-queries-happen-in-this-order&quot;&gt;SQL queries happen in this order&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up the order, and here it is! (SELECT isn’t the first thing, it’s like the 5th thing!) (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1179449535938076673&quot;&gt;here it is in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;(I really want to find a more accurate way of phrasing this than “sql queries happen/run in this order” but I haven’t figured it out yet)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/sql-queries.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/sql-queries.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a non-image format, the order is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM/JOIN&lt;/code&gt; and all the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HAVING&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; (including window functions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions-this-diagram-helps-you-answer&quot;&gt;questions this diagram helps you answer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram is about the &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt; of SQL queries – it lets you reason through what a given query will return and answers questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can I do &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; on something that came from a &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/code&gt;? (no! WHERE happens before GROUP BY!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I filter based on the results of a window function? (no! window functions happen in &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt;, which happens after both &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; based on something I did in GROUP BY? (yes! &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; is basically the last thing, you can &lt;code&gt;ORDER BY&lt;/code&gt; based on anything!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When does &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; happen? (at the very end!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database engines don’t actually literally run queries in this order&lt;/strong&gt; because they implement a bunch of optimizations to make queries run faster – we’ll get to that a little later in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;you can use this diagram when you just want to understand which queries are valid and how to reason about what results of a given query will be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; use this diagram to reason about query performance or anything involving indexes, that’s a much more complicated thing with a lot more variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;confounding-factor-column-aliases&quot;&gt;confounding factor: column aliases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone on Twitter pointed out that many SQL implementations let you use the syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, count(*)
FROM table
GROUP BY full_name
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This query makes it &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like GROUP BY happens after SELECT even though GROUP BY is first, because the GROUP BY references an alias from the SELECT. But it’s not actually necessary for the GROUP BY to run after the SELECT for this to work – the database engine can just rewrite the query as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name, count(*)
FROM table
GROUP BY CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and run the GROUP BY first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your database engine also definitely does a bunch of checks to make sure that what you put in SELECT and GROUP BY makes sense together before it even starts to run the query, so it has to look at the query as a whole anyway before it starts to come up with an execution plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;queries-aren-t-actually-run-in-this-order-optimizations&quot;&gt;queries aren’t actually run in this order (optimizations!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database engines in practice don’t actually run queries by joining, and then filtering, and then grouping, because they implement a bunch of optimizations reorder things to make the query run faster as long as reordering things won’t change the results of the query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple example of a reason why need to run queries in a different order to make them fast is that in this query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM
owners LEFT JOIN cats ON owners.id = cats.owner
WHERE cats.name = 'mr darcy'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it would be silly to do the whole left join and match up all the rows in the 2 tables if you just need to look up the 3 cats named ‘mr darcy’ – it’s way faster to do some filtering first for cats named ‘mr darcy’. And in this case filtering first doesn’t change the results of the query!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other optimizations that database engines implement in practice that might make them run queries in a different order but there’s no room for that and honestly it’s not something I’m an expert on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;linq-starts-queries-with-from&quot;&gt;LINQ starts queries with &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LINQ (a querying syntax in C# and VB.NET) uses the order &lt;code&gt;FROM ... WHERE ... SELECT&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s an example of a LINQ query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;var teenAgerStudent = from s in studentList
                      where s.Age &amp;gt; 12 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; s.Age &amp;lt; 20
                      select s;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pandas (my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook&quot;&gt;favourite data wrangling tool&lt;/a&gt;) also basically works like this, though you don’t need to use this exact order – I’ll often write pandas code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;df = thing1.join(thing2)      # like a JOIN
df = df[df.created_at &amp;gt; 1000] # like a WHERE
df = df.groupby('something', num_yes = ('yes', 'sum')) # like a GROUP BY
df = df[df.num_yes &amp;gt; 2]       # like a HAVING, filtering on the result of a GROUP BY
df = df[['num_yes', 'something1', 'something']] # pick the columns I want to display, like a SELECT
df.sort_values('sometthing', ascending=True)[:30] # ORDER BY and LIMIT
df[:30]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t because pandas is imposing any specific rule on how you have to write your code, though. It’s just that it often makes sense to write code in the order JOIN / WHERE / GROUP BY / HAVING. (I’ll often put a &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; first to improve performance though, and I think most database engines will also do a WHERE first in practice)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; in R also lets you use a different syntax for querying SQL databases like Postgres, MySQL and SQLite, which is also in a more logical order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-was-really-surprised-that-i-didn-t-know-this&quot;&gt;I was really surprised that I didn’t know this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing a blog post about this because when I found out the order I was SO SURPRISED that I’d never seen it written down that way before – it explains basically everything that I knew intuitively about why some queries are allowed and others aren’t. So I wanted to write it down in the hopes that it will help other people also understand how to write SQL queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 30, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Craig Federighi&lt;br/&gt;Apple&lt;br/&gt;Senior Vice President of Software Engineering&lt;br/&gt;One Apple Park Way&lt;br/&gt;Cupertino, CA 95014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RE: Apple Successfully Implements OpenID Connect with Sign In with Apple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dear Mr. Federighi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you are likely aware, on behalf of the OpenID Foundation Board of Directors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openid.net/2019/06/27/open-letter-from-the-openid-foundation-to-apple-regarding-sign-in-with-apple/&quot;&gt;I published an open letter to you June 27, 2019&lt;/a&gt; addressing the concerns we had with Apple’s implementation of OpenID Connect in the Sign In with Apple implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified the set of differences between OpenID Connect and Sign In with Apple and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/default/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md&quot;&gt;highlighted those in an open document&lt;/a&gt;. This document has since been updated to include changes your team made in your implementation of OpenID Connect. We applaud your team’s efforts in quickly addressing the critical security and compatibility gaps identified and successfully implementing them while Sign In with Apple is still in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now users will no longer be limited to where they can use the service and they can have confidence in their security and privacy. Furthermore, Sign In with Apple is now interoperable with widely available OpenID Connect Relying Party software. Apple, like others, can utilize the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openid.net/certification/&quot;&gt;OpenID Connect Self Certification Test Suite&lt;/a&gt; to further test and improve the Sign In with Apple implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there are still some peculiarities identified in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/default/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md&quot;&gt;open document&lt;/a&gt;. While these are not security issues, addressing them would make it even easier to use Sign In With Apple with existing OpenID Connect libraries. For instance, providing a discovery document would make it easier for existing software to be configured to use Sign In with Apple. We encourage your team to continue working through the issues identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the OpenID Foundation Board of Directors, I thank you and Apple for efficiently executing your updates. This is an important achievement for Apple, users of Sign In with Apple, and the digital identity community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nat Sakimura&lt;br/&gt;OpenID Foundation Chairman&lt;br/&gt;On behalf of the Board of Directors of the OpenID Foundation&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Attorney General will ask Zuckerberg to halt plans for end-to-end encryption</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/bill-barr-facebook-letter-halt-encryption</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/bill-barr-facebook-letter-halt-encryption</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Bill Barr, along with officials from the United Kingdom and Australia, is set to publish an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking the company to delay plans for end-to-end encryption across its messaging services until it can guarantee the added privacy does not reduce public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A draft of the letter, dated Oct. 4, is set to be released alongside the announcement of a new data-sharing agreement between law enforcement in the US and the UK; it was obtained by BuzzFeed News ahead of its publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signed by Barr, UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, acting US Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, and Australian Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, the letter raises concerns that Facebook’s plan to build end-to-end encryption into its messaging apps will prevent law enforcement agencies from finding illegal activity conducted through Facebook, including child sexual exploitation, terrorism, and election meddling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Security enhancements to the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable in the physical world,&quot; the letter reads. &quot;Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content, even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter calls on Facebook to prioritize public safety in designing its encryption by enabling law enforcement to gain access to illegal content in a manageable format and by consulting with governments ahead of time to ensure the changes will allow this access. While the letter acknowledges that Facebook — which owns Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram — captures 99% of child exploitation and terrorism-related content through its own systems, it also notes that &quot;mere numbers cannot capture the significance of the harm to children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Risks to public safety from Facebook’s proposals are exacerbated in the context of a single platform that would combine inaccessible messaging services with open profiles, providing unique routes for prospective offenders to identify and groom our children,&quot; the letter reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a three paragraph statement, Facebook said it strongly opposes government attempts to build backdoors. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I actually wouldn’t be surprised if we end up having similar engagements like this on other socially important things that we’re trying to move, like our big push to get towards more encryption across our messaging apps,&quot; Zuckerberg said in a closed-door July meeting with employees, according to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20892354/mark-zuckerberg-full-transcript-leaked-facebook-meetings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaked audio obtained by the Verge.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;That will, over time, be very sensitive when we get closer to rolling it out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Law enforcement, obviously, is not going to be psyched about that,&quot; he added. &quot;But we think it’s the right thing to protect people’s privacy more, so we’ll go defend that when the time is right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s much-publicized turn toward privacy, officially announced in a March post by Zuckerberg, was in part a response to years of public scrutiny over the company’s fast and loose approach to data privacy, touched off by the revelation in early 2018 that the tech giant had let the British election consultancy Cambridge Analytica harvest the data of up to 87 million users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the full draft of the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;128&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 October 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEN LETTER: FACEBOOK’S “PRIVACY FIRST” PROPOSALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are writing to request that Facebook does not proceed with its plan to implement end-to-end encryption across its messaging services without ensuring that there is no reduction to user safety and without including a means for lawful access to the content of communications to protect our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your post of 6 March 2019, “A Privacy-Focused Vision for Social Networking,” you acknowledged that “there are real safety concerns to address before we can implement end-to-end encryption across all our messaging services.” You stated that “we have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent” the use of Facebook for things like child sexual exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. We welcome this commitment to consultation. As you know, our governments have engaged with Facebook on this issue, and some of us have written to you to express our views. Unfortunately, Facebook has not committed to address our serious concerns about the impact its proposals could have on protecting our most vulnerable citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We support strong encryption, which is used by billions of people every day for services such as banking, commerce, and communications. We also respect promises made by technology companies to protect users’ data. Law abiding citizens have a legitimate expectation that their privacy will be protected. However, as your March blog post recognized, we must ensure that technology companies protect their users and others affected by their users’ online activities. Security enhancements to the virtual world should not make us more vulnerable in the physical world. We must find a way to balance the need to secure data with public safety and the need for law enforcement to access the information they need to safeguard the public, investigate crimes, and prevent future criminal activity. Not doing so hinders our law enforcement agencies’ ability to stop criminals and abusers in their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies should not deliberately design their systems to preclude any form of access to content, even for preventing or investigating the most serious crimes. This puts our citizens and societies at risk by severely eroding a company’s ability to detect and respond to illegal content and activity, such as child sexual exploitation and abuse, terrorism, and foreign adversaries’ attempts to undermine democratic values and institutions, preventing the prosecution of offenders and safeguarding of victims. It also impedes law enforcement’s ability to investigate these and other serious crimes. Risks to public safety from Facebook’s proposals are exacerbated in the context of a single platform that would combine inaccessible messaging services with open profiles, providing unique routes for prospective offenders to identify and groom our children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook currently undertakes significant work to identify and tackle the most serious illegal content and activity by enforcing your community standards. In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports to the US National Center for Missing &amp;amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) – more than 90% of the 18.4 million total reports that year. As well as child abuse imagery, these referrals include more than 8,000 reports related to attempts by offenders to meet children online and groom or entice them into sharing indecent imagery or meeting in real life. The UK National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates that, last year, NCMEC reporting from Facebook will have resulted in more than 2,500 arrests by UK law enforcement and almost 3,000 children safeguarded in the UK. Your transparency reports show that Facebook also acted against 26 million pieces of terrorist content between October 2017 and March 2019. More than 99% of the content Facebook takes action against – both for child sexual exploitation and terrorism – is identified by your safety systems, rather than by reports from users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these statistics are remarkable, mere numbers cannot capture the significance of the harm to children. To take one example, Facebook sent a priority report to NCMEC, having identified a child who had sent self-produced child sexual abuse material to an adult male. Facebook located multiple chats between the two that indicated historical and ongoing sexual abuse. When investigators were able to locate and interview the child, she reported that the adult had sexually abused her hundreds of times over the course of four years, starting when she was 11. He also regularly demanded that she send him sexually explicit imagery of herself. The offender, who had held a position of trust with the child, was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Without the information from Facebook, abuse of this girl might be continuing to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our understanding is that much of this activity, which is critical to protecting children and fighting terrorism, will no longer be possible if Facebook implements its proposals as planned. NCMEC estimates that 70% of Facebook’s reporting – 12 million reports globally – would be lost. This would significantly increase the risk of child sexual exploitation or other serious harms. You have said yourself that “we face an inherent tradeoff because we will never find all of the potential harm we do today when our security systems can see the messages themselves”. While this tradeoff has not been quantified, we are very concerned that the right balance is not being struck, which would make your platform an unsafe space, including for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally important to Facebook’s own work to act against illegal activity, law enforcement rely on obtaining the content of communications, under appropriate legal authorisation, to save lives, enable criminals to be brought to justice, and exonerate the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore call on Facebook and other companies to take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Embed the safety of the public in system designs, thereby enabling you to continue to act against illegal content effectively with no reduction to safety, and facilitating the prosecution of offenders and safeguarding of victims;&lt;br/&gt;· Enable law enforcement to obtain lawful access to content in a readable and usable format;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Engage in consultation with governments to facilitate this in a way that is substantive and genuinely influences your design decisions; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Not implement the proposed changes until you can ensure that the systems you would apply to maintain the safety of your users are fully tested and operational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are committed to working with you to focus on reasonable proposals that will allow Facebook and our governments to protect your users and the public, while protecting their privacy. Our technical experts are confident that we can do so while defending cyber security and supporting technological innovation. We will take an open and balanced approach in line with the joint statement of principles signed by the governments of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada in August 2018[1] and the subsequent communique agreed in July this year[2].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you have recognised, it is critical to get this right for the future of the internet. Children’s safety and law enforcement’s ability to bring criminals to justice must not be the ultimate cost of Facebook taking forward these proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rt Hon Priti Patel MP&lt;br/&gt;United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Home Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William P. Barr&lt;br/&gt;United States Attorney General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin K. McAleenan&lt;br/&gt;United States Secretary of Homeland Security (Acting)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hon Peter Dutton MP&lt;br/&gt;Australian Minister for Home Affairs&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Report: Young adults more likely to live with parents than spouses</title>
<link>https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/reconfiguring-the-american-household/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/reconfiguring-the-american-household/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_334969379-1024x666.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17711&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_334969379-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_334969379-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_334969379-768x499.jpg 768w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_334969379-152x99.jpg 152w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; pagespeed_url_hash=&quot;90610714&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to a new analysis of U.S. Census data, household composition – the way in which Americans organize themselves into households – is steadily changing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young adults are becoming much less likely to share their home with a spouse or children; instead, they are moving back in with parents, or living with roommates and/or unmarried partners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;26-year-olds provide a stark example: 50 years ago, over three-quarters were married and living with their spouse; today, this living arrangement has shrunk to just 24 percent. In 2018, there were 300,000 more 26-year-olds living with parents than spouses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;These trends mean that across the country, the nuclear family household is slowly disappearing. In 2018, the number of nuclear family households was the same as in 1984, when the United States population was 27 percent smaller. Nuclear families are becoming more expensive to maintain, and we see them declining in 20 of the nation’s 25 largest metropolitan areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conversely, it is becoming much more common for multiple family units to live together under one roof. In some metros, these “unrelated” households have more than doubled since the start of the Great Recession.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social and economic forces are encouraging many Americans – particularly at the lower end of the income distribution – to band together and form larger households in order to afford their preferred housing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing who to live with is one of the most important housing decisions we make. Should I move back home with mom and dad, or find roommates? Should I wait until marriage to move in with my significant other? If I look for an apartment with my sister and her husband, could we all share a nicer place? Researchers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/cost-burden-2018/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;including us&lt;/a&gt;) often analyze household-level data to learn about housing markets, but how do people sort into households in the first place? Household composition both shapes the demand for housing and adapts to housing availability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American household has been gradually evolving for decades — growing and diversifying. We analyze data from fifty years of the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey to understand how shifts in cultural norms and economic conditions have influenced who lives together. These trends provide context and clues for what may happen next, as urban affordability becomes more scarce and coliving spaces make a push for the mainstream. Signs point to a future where there is really no such thing as a typical household.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adults in Their Mid-20s Are Now More Likely to Live with a Parent Than a Spouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the vast majority of young adults in America lived with their spouse. Today, that is far from the case. The interactive chart below visualizes how living arrangements have changed over the last five decades. These arrangements include: living alone, with a married spouse, with an unmarried partner, with a parent, or with a non-family roommate. The lines represent the likelihood that people of a certain age live in a certain type of household. Moving the slider changes the age of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;Download Complete Data (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19IEg8hYoU9SxHxxwtIzyXIG7lPYIG371pAtalucfPg4/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Download Complete Living Arrangements Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;As marriage rates &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/marital-historical-time-series.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;continue to drop&lt;/a&gt;, the likelihood that young Americans live with a spouse has been in steady decline. Meanwhile, living with parents is becoming increasingly common for adults as they age into their late twenties and early thirties. Other household choices, such as living with roommates, living alone, or living with an unmarried partner, are also on the rise. Millennials today live in a much more varied range of household types than their predecessors did in young adulthood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking 26-year-olds provides a particularly striking example of how young adult living arrangements have shifted over time. Fifty years ago, 76 percent of 26-year-olds were married and cohabitating with spouses. Today, that share has plummeted to just 24 percent. Simultaneously, the share living at home has steadily risen, so that by 2018 there are over 300,000 more 26-year-olds living with parents than spouses. Meanwhile, living alone, living with roommates, and living with an unmarried partner have also become more common. Each of these arrangements represented fewer than 5 percent of 26-year-olds in the late 1960s, but today, 10 percent live alone, 15 percent live with a non-family roommate, and 17 percent live with an unmarried partner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/gganim_hh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17617&quot; pagespeed_url_hash=&quot;1390301706&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the Great Recession, Living with Parents, Roommates, or Unmarried Partners Has Become Much More Common for Young Adults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of 26-year-olds, and of young adults in general, highlights the economy’s influence on how people arrange themselves into households. Starting with 2007 – the year before the collapse of the housing market bubble – we see the beginning of a steady divergence in young adult housing composition that has continued to the present-day. This is a period characterized by economic recession, ballooning student debt, and even as the economy recovered, a dearth of affordable housing options in the cities with the best job opportunities. All of these factors put downward pressure on young adults who, in previous generations, would have been ready to start their own households. Instead, 25-34-year-olds today are 46 percent more likely to live with a parent than in 2007, 32 percent more likely to move in with a partner before getting married, and 19 percent more likely to have a non-family roommate. In contrast, the likelihood of living with a spouse or a child have declined steadily, as cultural norms around marriage and education have encouraged millennials to start families later in life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/likelihood_post_recession-1024x695.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17656&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/likelihood_post_recession-1024x695.png 1024w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/likelihood_post_recession-300x204.png 300w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/likelihood_post_recession-768x522.png 768w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/likelihood_post_recession-152x103.png 152w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/likelihood_post_recession.png 1508w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; pagespeed_url_hash=&quot;4098455338&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unrelated Households Are on the Rise While Nuclear Family Homes Are Becoming Less Common&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As young adults form households with roommates, partners, and parents, we observe broader changes in the overall household composition of many American cities. To measure this shift, we developed a framework for categorizing every American household according to the relationships among its members. &lt;em&gt;Single-person households&lt;/em&gt; represent adults living on their own. In &lt;em&gt;related households,&lt;/em&gt; all members are related to one another by blood, marriage, adoption, or partnership. This includes married and unmarried couples living together, nuclear families, and other single-family arrangements. &lt;em&gt;Unrelated households&lt;/em&gt; are multi-person households in which at least one member is not related to the others. This includes the classic roommate arrangement or family members who share their homes with an unrelated housemate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total number of households in the United States rose 10 percent from 2007 to 2018, reaching a peak of 127.5 million. Related households comprise the vast majority but are the slowest-growing group (7 percent growth), growing half as quickly as single-person households (15 percent) and one-third as quickly as unrelated households (22 percent). The table below allows you to compare national trends to those of the 25 largest metropolitan areas across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of the 11.6 million new households formed since 2007, nearly half of them have unrelated housemates living together. And in five particular metros – Orlando, San Antonio, Denver, San Diego, and Charlotte – the number of unrelated households has more than doubled in the last twelve years. In fact, only four of the 25 largest metros experienced a drop in this household type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/growth_unrelated-1024x702.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17657&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/growth_unrelated-1024x702.png 1024w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/growth_unrelated-300x206.png 300w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/growth_unrelated-768x527.png 768w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/growth_unrelated-152x104.png 152w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/growth_unrelated.png 1502w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; pagespeed_url_hash=&quot;2437375942&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other eye-popping trend is that while unrelated households are on the rise, there are over 1 million &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;/em&gt; nuclear family households today than in 2007. This household type represents the archetypal American home: a married couple and their children, all living together under one roof. In our framework, it is the only household arrangement to shrink over time, and it is doing so at a staggering rate. 50 years ago, 42 percent of all American households were nuclear families; today, they comprise only 22 percent. And in 2018, there are roughly the same number of nuclear family households as in 1984, when the total United States population was 27 percent smaller. This decline is driven by two factors: 1) lower marriage and fertility rates leading to fewer nuclear families altogether, and 2) a greater percentage of nuclear families sharing their homes with non-nuclear housemates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/decline_nuclear-1024x830.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17658&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/decline_nuclear-1024x830.png 1024w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/decline_nuclear-300x243.png 300w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/decline_nuclear-768x623.png 768w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/decline_nuclear-152x123.png 152w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/decline_nuclear.png 1492w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; pagespeed_url_hash=&quot;3512543283&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2007 to 2018, the prevalence of nuclear family households dropped in 20 of the nation’s 25 largest metropolitan areas. In Southern California, Riverside metro once had the highest nuclear family rate in the nation before falling almost 8 percentage points. Nearby Los Angeles and San Diego metros also experienced declines, as did Boston (-7 percent), Denver (-6 percent), St. Louis (-5 percent), Atlanta (-4 percent), New York (-4 percent) and Philadelphia (-3 percent). Baltimore and Houston are the only metros posting a notable increase in the share of nuclear family households (+3 percent and +1 percent, respectively).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Housing Costs Are Fueling the Rise of Larger, Unrelated Households&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many markets, nuclear household formation may be declining because the cost is becoming prohibitive. In 2018, the median nuclear family’s household income was $101,722, well above the national median of $63,179. As &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/housing-markets-and-income-inequality/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;housing costs rise faster than incomes&lt;/a&gt;, wealthier families can maintain this household type without the support of supplemental income from non-nuclear housemates. But not all are so fortunate; nearly 15 percent of nuclear families live with a roommate or additional family member. And for those at the lower end of the income distribution, we see individuals (and families) banding together to afford their preferred housing. The table below compares median household and individual incomes, along with the average number of adults, for each household type. Personal incomes are highest for nuclear families and couples or individuals who live on their own. Incomes are much lower for those who share their housing with roommates and/or non-nuclear family members. Specifically, in Family + Roommate households, personal incomes are low while household incomes are high because these households have, on average, one extra adult contributing to the total income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hh_incomes-1-1024x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-17777&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hh_incomes-1-1024x469.png 1024w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hh_incomes-1-300x137.png 300w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hh_incomes-1-768x352.png 768w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hh_incomes-1-152x70.png 152w, https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hh_incomes-1.png 1476w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; pagespeed_url_hash=&quot;2606715563&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, we expect these trends to continue. Housing costs are rising quickly, especially in booming, urban job hubs and for those at the lower end of the income distribution. As rents continue to go up, roommates and coliving arrangements become even more appealing and we expect to see households grow or merge to afford available housing. Families, meanwhile, increasingly welcome relatives (and strangers) into their households. Moreover, as certain household arrangements become more common, stigma around them likely dissipates. It gets easier to move back in with mom and dad well into adulthood when the entire friend-group already has.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diversification of the American household may also, in time, shape what our housing looks and feels like. As more people both search for roommates or choose to live alone, a wave of coliving companies is betting on shared living spaces. Growth in the popularity and policy relevance of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) mirrors the rise in large related or unrelated households. Homebuyers are starting to seek out homes that provide home sharing opportunities. If there is increasingly no such thing as a typical household, we soon won’t recognize a typical home either.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Khasho who? One year after gruesome murder, investors embrace Saudi Arabia again</title>
<link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90412231/year-after-khashoggi-murder-investors-embrace-saudi-arabia</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcompany.com/90412231/year-after-khashoggi-murder-investors-embrace-saudi-arabia</guid>

&lt;p&gt;A year ago today, journalist Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never emerged. In the wake of his gruesome murder, major U.S. investors and executives from Uber and Google boycotted the regime’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://futureinvestmentinitiative.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;annual investment conference&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed “Davos in the Desert”; prominent U.S. lawmakers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-10-02/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-killing-mohammad-bin-salman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;proposed bills to halt arms sales to the kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and asserted that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “has got to go”; and experts anticipated that foreign investment in the country would plummet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;52.910510764035&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a difference a year makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 40 executives from U.S. companies, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup, will attend the kingdom’s Future Investment Initiative event in Riyadh later this month. Also attending will be Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as BlackRock’s Larry Fink, who boycotted last year’s event. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/laurencefink_i-was-in-riyadh-last-week-talking-about-foreign-activity-6528740360557076480-bZzS/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Fink explained his decision&lt;/a&gt; in a post on LinkedIn: “I believe greater economic integration and diversification will help Saudi Arabia build a more modern and sustainable economy for all of its citizens,” he wrote, adding that “corporate engagement and public dialogue can help with that evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some major tech investors and executives are still staying away, including those from Google, Uber, and Amazon (whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, attended a vigil for Khashoggi today, which is understandable since Khashoggi was a writer for the Bezos-owned &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;). But not everyone is avoiding the conference—early Facebook investor Jim Breyer and Magic Leap’s chief product officer are both expected to attend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/as-backlash-fears-fade-major-firms-are-returning-to-saudi-arabia-a-year-after-khashoggis-killing/2019/09/30/db73829a-defb-11e9-be7f-4cc85017c36f_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;according to a list&lt;/a&gt; obtained by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breyer declined to comment through his spokesman, Matt Benson. Magic Leap spokeswoman Julia Gaynor also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for tech startups, they aren’t exactly spurning the kingdom when it comes to investments. For instance, British health tech company Babylon raised $550 million in August in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/saudi-arabia-backs-550-million-investment-in-health-startup-babylon.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;investment round&lt;/a&gt; backed by Saudi Arabia’s massive sovereign wealth fund. The London-based company said Friday that it was now worth $2 billion following the fundraising, which also saw German reinsurer Munich Re’s ERGO Fund and an undisclosed U.S. health insurer—which a Sky News &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.sky.com/story/us-health-giant-centene-invests-in-nhs-chatbot-app-babylon-11775051&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; identified as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CNC&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;Centene&lt;/a&gt;—invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the U.S. just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/21/politics/pelosi-saudi-uae-arms-sales-troops-outrageous/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to send additional troops along with enhanced air and missile defense systems to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, on top of an $8.1 billion sale of weapons (including precision-guided bombs and related components) to those countries pushed by the administration earlier in the summer. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited MBS, which shows no signs of leaving or resigning, for a friendly chat back in June, and President Trump dismissed a UN request for the FBI to investigate the murder, despite the fact that Khashoggi was a U.S. resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;17.530674846626&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/02/investors-still-cautious-on-saudi-arabia-a-year-since-khashoggi-murder.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;increased in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (from $1.4 billion in 2017 to $3.2 billion), though it has dipped in the past year due to lower oil prices and investors turned off by its continuing military campaign in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top off the bitter irony, “Davos in the Desert” is being held this year at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh—that’s the hotel where MBS infamously detained hundreds of rich and powerful Saudis in 2017 as part of an “anti-corruption campaign.” Though most of them were eventually released, some of them are now in real jail, the maximum-security Al-Ha’er prison about 25 miles south of the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;10.940217391304&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the special behavior of &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-oid.html&quot; title=&quot;8.19. Object Identifier Types&quot;&gt;oid&lt;/a&gt; columns (Andres Freund, John Naylor)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, a normally-invisible &lt;code class=&quot;structfield&quot;&gt;oid&lt;/code&gt; column could be specified during table creation using &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;WITH OIDS&lt;/code&gt;; that ability has been removed. Columns can still be explicitly declared as type &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;oid&lt;/code&gt;. Operations on tables that have columns created using &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;WITH OIDS&lt;/code&gt; will need adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system catalogs that previously had hidden &lt;code class=&quot;structfield&quot;&gt;oid&lt;/code&gt; columns now have ordinary &lt;code class=&quot;structfield&quot;&gt;oid&lt;/code&gt; columns. Hence, &lt;code class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;SELECT *&lt;/code&gt; will now output those columns, whereas previously they would be displayed only if selected explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove data types &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;abstime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;reltime&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;tinterval&lt;/code&gt; (Andres Freund)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are obsoleted by SQL-standard types such as &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;timetravel&lt;/code&gt; extension (Andres Freund)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;6.9795918367347&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;recovery.conf&lt;/code&gt; settings into &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-ARCHIVE-RECOVERY&quot; title=&quot;19.5.4. Archive Recovery&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;postgresql.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Masao Fujii, Simon Riggs, Abhijit Menon-Sen, Sergei Kornilov)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;recovery.conf&lt;/code&gt; is no longer used, and the server will not start if that file exists. &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-ARCHIVE-RECOVERY&quot; title=&quot;19.5.4. Archive Recovery&quot;&gt;recovery.signal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;standby.signal&lt;/code&gt; files are now used to switch into non-primary mode. The &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;trigger_file&lt;/code&gt; setting has been renamed to &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-PROMOTE-TRIGGER-FILE&quot;&gt;promote_trigger_file&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;standby_mode&lt;/code&gt; setting has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;9.8993435448578&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not allow multiple conflicting &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-WAL-RECOVERY-TARGET&quot; title=&quot;19.5.5. Recovery Target&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;recovery_target&lt;/code&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; specifications (Peter Eisentraut)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, only allow one of &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-TARGET&quot;&gt;recovery_target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-TARGET-LSN&quot;&gt;recovery_target_lsn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-TARGET-NAME&quot;&gt;recovery_target_name&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-TARGET-TIME&quot;&gt;recovery_target_time&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-TARGET-XID&quot;&gt;recovery_target_xid&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, multiple different instances of these parameters could be specified, and the last one was honored. Now, only one can be specified, though the same one can be specified multiple times and the last specification is honored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;2.5955056179775&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause recovery to advance to the latest timeline by default (Peter Eisentraut)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-TARGET-TIMELINE&quot;&gt;recovery_target_timeline&lt;/a&gt; now defaults to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt;. Previously, it defaulted to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;current&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;7.9354838709677&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refactor code for &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-geometry.html&quot; title=&quot;9.11. Geometric Functions and Operators&quot;&gt;geometric functions and operators&lt;/a&gt; (Emre Hasegeli)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could lead to more accurate, but slightly different, results compared to previous releases. Notably, cases involving NaN, underflow, overflow, and division by zero are handled more consistently than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;13.569832402235&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve performance by using a new algorithm for output of &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-FLOAT&quot; title=&quot;8.1.3. Floating-Point Types&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;double precision&lt;/code&gt; values (Andrew Gierth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, displayed floating-point values were rounded to 6 (for &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;) or 15 (for &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;double precision&lt;/code&gt;) digits by default, adjusted by the value of &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-EXTRA-FLOAT-DIGITS&quot;&gt;extra_float_digits&lt;/a&gt;. Now, whenever &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;extra_float_digits&lt;/code&gt; is more than zero (as it now is by default), only the minimum number of digits required to preserve the exact binary value are output. The behavior is the same as before when &lt;code class=&quot;varname&quot;&gt;extra_float_digits&lt;/code&gt; is set to zero or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, formatting of floating-point exponents is now uniform across platforms: two digits are used unless three are necessary. In previous releases, Windows builds always printed three digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;5.8930957683742&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequence of &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;random()&lt;/code&gt; values generated following a &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;setseed()&lt;/code&gt; call with a particular seed value is likely to be different now than before. However, it will also be repeatable, which was not previously guaranteed because of interference from other uses of random numbers inside the server. The SQL &lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;random()&lt;/code&gt; function now has its own private per-session state to forestall that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;5.8230563002681&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change SQL-style &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-SIMILARTO-REGEXP&quot; title=&quot;9.7.2. SIMILAR TO Regular Expressions&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;substring()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to have standard-compliant greediness behavior (Tom Lane)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where the pattern can be matched in more than one way, the initial sub-pattern is now treated as matching the least possible amount of text rather than the greatest; for example, a pattern such as &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;%#&quot;aa*#&quot;%&lt;/code&gt; now selects the first group of &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;'s from the input, not the last group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;4.8793103448276&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not pretty-print the result of &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-xml.html&quot; title=&quot;9.14. XML Functions&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;xpath()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;XMLTABLE&lt;/code&gt; construct (Tom Lane)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, these functions would insert extra whitespace (newlines and/or spaces) in nodeset values. This is undesirable since depending on usage, the whitespace might be considered semantically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, this happened by default if no destination was specified, but that was deemed to be unfriendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, for example, &lt;code class=&quot;command&quot;&gt;\pset format a&lt;/code&gt; chose &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;aligned&lt;/code&gt;; it will now fail since that could equally well mean &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;asciidoc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In new btree indexes, the maximum index entry length is reduced by eight bytes, to improve handling of duplicate entries (Peter Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that a &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-reindex.html&quot; title=&quot;REINDEX&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refentrytitle&quot;&gt;REINDEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; operation on an index &lt;span class=&quot;application&quot;&gt;pg_upgrade&lt;/span&gt;'d from a previous release could potentially fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change supports hiding potentially-sensitive statistics data from unprivileged users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparison operators for data type &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; can now use any collation, rather than always using &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; collation. To preserve the previous semantics of queries, columns of type &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; are now explicitly marked as having &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; collation. A side effect of this is that regular-expression operators on &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; columns will now use the &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; collation by default, not the database collation, to determine the behavior of locale-dependent regular expression patterns (such as &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;). If you want non-C behavior for a regular expression on a &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; column, attach an explicit &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;COLLATE&lt;/code&gt; clause. (For user-defined &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; columns, another possibility is to specify a different collation at table creation time; but that just moves the non-backwards-compatibility to the comparison operators.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;17.669050051073&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat object-name columns in the &lt;a class=&quot;link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/information-schema.html&quot; title=&quot;Chapter 36. The Information Schema&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;structname&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; views as being of type &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; (Tom Lane)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the SQL standard, object-name columns in the &lt;code class=&quot;structname&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/code&gt; views are declared as being of domain type &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;sql_identifier&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;span class=&quot;productname&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/span&gt;, the underlying catalog columns are really of type &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;. This change makes &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;sql_identifier&lt;/code&gt; be a domain over &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;, rather than &lt;code class=&quot;type&quot;&gt;varchar&lt;/code&gt; as before. This eliminates a semantic mismatch in comparison and sorting behavior, which can greatly improve the performance of queries on &lt;code class=&quot;structname&quot;&gt;information_schema&lt;/code&gt; views that restrict an object-name column. Note however that inequality restrictions, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;programlisting&quot;&gt;
SELECT ... FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name &amp;lt; 'foo';
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will now use &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;-locale comparison semantics by default, rather than the database's default collation as before. Sorting on these columns will also follow &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; ordering rules. The previous behavior (and inefficiency) can be enforced by adding a &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;COLLATE &quot;default&quot;&lt;/code&gt; clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot; readability=&quot;1.6338028169014&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the ability to disable dynamic shared memory (Kyotaro Horiguchi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-SHARED-MEMORY-TYPE&quot;&gt;dynamic_shared_memory_type&lt;/a&gt; can no longer be set to &lt;code class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-item__teaser-text serif&quot;&gt;Dining-hall data suggest that a rise in vegetarian options leads customers to embrace meat-free meals.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-item__body serif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dining establishments can nudge consumers to eat less meat by offering more vegetarian choices, according to a study of university-cafeteria sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma Garnett and her colleagues at the University of Cambridge, UK, collected data on more than 94,000 meals sold in 3 of the cafeterias at the university in 2017. When the proportion of meatless options doubled from one to two of four choices, overall sales remained about constant. But sales of meat-containing meals dropped, and sales of vegetarian meals, such as “wild mushroom, roasted butternut squash and sun blushed tomato risotto with parmesan”, rose 40–80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increases in plant-based dining were largest among people with the lowest baseline rates of vegetarian-meal consumption. The researchers found no evidence that higher sales of vegetarian dishes at lunch led to lower vegetarian sales at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other variables that influenced dining choices included the relative prices of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and the outdoor temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that an increase in vegetarian options could encourage consumers to move away from meat-heavy diets, potentially reducing greenhouse-gas emissions linked to animal-derived food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google Is Uncovering Hundreds of Race Conditions Within the Linux Kernel</title>

<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;GOOGLE -- &quot; src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/google.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
One of the contributions Google is working on for the upstream Linux kernel is a new &quot;sanitizer&quot;. Over the years Google has worked on AddressSanitizer for finding memory corruption bugs, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer for undefined behavior within code, and other sanitizers. The Linux kernel has been exposed to this as well as other open-source projects while their newest sanitizer is KCSAN and focused as a Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer.&lt;p&gt;The Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer (KCSAN) is focused on discovering data-race issues within the kernel code. This dynamic data-race detector is an alternative to the Kernel Thread Sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their testing just last month, in two days they found over 300 unique data race conditions within the mainline kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a recent discussion about the Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/20/394&quot;&gt;LKML&lt;/a&gt;. For those wanting to learn more, the code at least for now is being hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/ktsan/wiki/KCSAN&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto-antonym&lt;/strong&gt; has Greek roots meaning a word that is the opposite of itself. They have variously been called &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;contranyms&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;contronyms&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;antilogies&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;Janus words&lt;/strong&gt; (after the two-faced Greek mythical figure, from which &quot;January&quot; also derives), and &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;enantiodromes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a list af many such words, and their associated opposite (or near-opposite) meanings.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;Dust&lt;/strong&gt; is part of a series of noun-verb conversions related to coverings of things. If the noun gives a covering that is natural to the thing, then the verb means remove the covering. If the covering is imposed, the verb means put the covering on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you get &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;shell an egg&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;peel a banana&lt;/strong&gt;, but &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;paint the furniture&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;wax the floor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;Dust&lt;/strong&gt; is interesting because it can go either way: &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;dust the furniture&lt;/strong&gt; (a sort of natural covering to be removed) vs. &lt;strong class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;dust the crops&lt;/strong&gt; (put stuff on them that they didn't have and wouldn't unless humans put it there). I mentioned this in my English grammar book &lt;em&gt;Stalking the Wild Verb Phrase&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
