<title>Tim Cook’s Company-Wide Email on Hkmap.live Doesn’t Add Up</title>
<link>https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/10/cook-hkmap-live-email</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/10/cook-hkmap-live-email</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a copy of Cook’s company-wide memo, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rLT7xhVO6c?amp=1&quot;&gt;the copy reproduced here&lt;/a&gt; is accurate. Maciej Ceglowski — who has been in Hong Kong for weeks — responds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first allegation is that “the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence”. This makes no sense at all. The app does not show the locations of individual officers at all. It shows general concentrations of police units, with a significant lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the developer and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/charlesmok&quot;&gt;@charlesmok&lt;/a&gt;, a Hong Kong legislator, have pointed out, the app aggregates reports from Telegram, Facebook and other sources. It beggars belief that a campaign to target individual officers would use a world-readable crowdsourcing format like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, what are these incidents where protesters have targeted individual police for a premeditated attack? Can Mr. Cook point to a single example? Can anyone? […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not only is there no evidence for this claim, but it goes against the documentary record of 18 weeks of protests, and is not even possible given the technical constraints of the app (which tracks groups of police).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, related allegation is that the app helps “victimize individuals and property where no police are present”. Again, does Mr. Cook have any evidence for this claim? The app does not show an absence of police, it shows concentrations of police, tear gas, riot flags etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny. For a company that usually measures umpteen times before cutting anything, it’s both sad and startling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Broken</title>
<link>https://tyler.io/broken/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tyler.io/broken/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the blog post intended to write. In fact, last night I drafted up one about my problems sending background push notifications with Amazon SNS (coming soon!). And after the ridiculously over-the-top shit-storm that blew up over &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tylerhall/status/1181324733893287938&quot;&gt;my dumb tweet&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, the last thing I wanted to do was step back in that arena. But this needs to be said. But, first…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an Apple developer. It’s the specific nerd sub-culture that I identify with the strongest. I’ve been writing and selling &lt;a href=&quot;https://clickontyler.com&quot;&gt;my own software&lt;/a&gt; for macOS since 2003 – back when it was still Mac OS X – back when apps were called software. And I had apps in the iOS and Mac App Stores on day one of their respective openings. I’m not rich from it, and I don’t claim to even be that successful. But for a few wonderful years my own apps were my full time income. I’m not part of the old guard of Mac developers, but I’ve been around the block and doing this for over a decade and a half. I hope I’ve earned the right to spout off my stupid opinions on the internet occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as an Apple software developer, I live through the Summer beta periods. On my secondary machine. And, in recent years, within virtual machines that allow me to do more intricate testing. I’ve seen easy-going mostly spit and polish releases as well more substantial user-facing and under-the-hood ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Catalina has been different in two particularly gruesome ways that get even worse when combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, is purely from a stability and functional standpoint. The early betas of Catalina were really, really broken. But that’s OK! That’s what betas are for. And while I can only speak for myself, I think most developers are more than happy to offer input to Apple and report bugs. So I’m totally fine using a wonky OS for a few months on a spare machine while I test my own software in addition to Apple’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the bad part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is becoming (already is?) a services company. And, let’s face it. Apple has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been good at anything involving the internet. I feel like they could have all the money and engineers in the world (which they basically already do) and still never completely get their services right because it’s just not in their DNA. Applications are. Hardware is. But put a network layer in there and they crap themselves. (Ok, not in every case. I’m obviously exaggerating to make a point. But the overall track record is iffy at best.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so when they decide to overhaul how CloudKit and iCloud Drive work and then merge those changes into an already buggier-than-usual beta OS, disaster can ensue. Because now those bugs – file corruptions, missing data, broken APIs and fundamental things that simply stop syncing – can spill over and infect your other Macs running a stable OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my own fault for not knowing any better and signing into my Catalina machine with my personal Apple ID, but I needed to do some iCloud development this Summer and using my own ID just made things simpler. But after I ended up with (not joking) two-hundred duplicated &lt;code&gt;~/Documents&lt;/code&gt; directories – each with a random assortment of duplicated files of different revisions – I swore off dealing with Catalina and iCloud for the rest of the Summer. I put all of those new features on hold and planned to pick them back up after the GM when everything stabilized. I signed out of iCloud on every Catalina machine and VM and assumed Apple would get their problems sorted by Fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wasn’t alone in that assessment and strategy. Just google around for developer blog posts and tweets from the beta 3-ish time period. And that’s the puzzling and quite scary thing about all of this and the ultimate point I want to make. We (developers) were making it loud and clear that this stuff was very, very broken. And, somehow, someone at Apple made the call that it was OK to release a &lt;em&gt;Public&lt;/em&gt; beta onto the world. A buggy, broken OS is one thing. Users installing it should know to beware. But a buggy, broken OS that also puts their data in jeopardy both on that machine and all their others linked by an Apple ID is unconscionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still the betas marched on. And eventually it seemed like Apple realized what they were up against and threw in the towel and reverted the OS-level iCloud changes – much like &lt;code&gt;discoveryd&lt;/code&gt; a number of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I just read and heard about all of this. I was completely off iCloud on Catalina at this point and assumed the massive rollback would fix things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Apple officially released Catalina to the public this week without so much as a press release or heads-up to developers (yes, there had been a GM build, but still, would an email to developers ahead of time have been so difficult?), I was ready to upgrade and go all-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I was being naive, but I truly care about the experience my software customers have. And that means I have to live with the same system they do – even if that means dealing with OS bugs that just couldn’t be fixed in time for the .0 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll go through some of the highlights (lowlights?) I’ve run into below, but I guess this is my thesis: The final (well, first) Catalina release along with the outright awful public beta makes me think one thing. And that is Apple’s insistence on their annual, big-splash release cycle is fundamentally breaking engineering. I know I’m not privy to their internal decision making and that software features that depend on hardware releases and vice-versa are planned and timed years (if not half-decades) in advance, but I can think of no other explanation than that Marketing alone is purely in charge of when things ship. Why else would stuff so completely broken and lacking the attention to detail that Apple is known for and (ahem) markets themselves on have shipped if not than to meet an arbitrary deadline? Apple has so many balls in the air – and this metaphor doesn’t really make any sense now that I’m typing it – but they’re all interconnected now that Apple is a services company. And as a services company they must find a way to ship features, fixes, and updates outside of the run-up to the holiday season. They need to be more (and, oh god, this word makes me want to vomit) agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Annotated Summary of the Catalina Crap I’ve Noticed So Far&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Allow or Deny&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with my now infamous tweet from the other day. (I’m an influencer!) This screenshot has absolutely been manipulated to make a point, but everything in it is real. It’s all of the security warnings and permission dialogs that I ran into (and screenshotted and arranged for maximum effect) during my iMac’s first startup after installing Catalina as well as about ten minutes of poking around and launching a few apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1416&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8DF8764D-61E2-49BC-8548-8A864EAF3F9F.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Hoo, boy.&quot; width=&quot;1800&quot; height=&quot;1012&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8DF8764D-61E2-49BC-8548-8A864EAF3F9F.jpeg 1800w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8DF8764D-61E2-49BC-8548-8A864EAF3F9F-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8DF8764D-61E2-49BC-8548-8A864EAF3F9F-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8DF8764D-61E2-49BC-8548-8A864EAF3F9F-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8DF8764D-61E2-49BC-8548-8A864EAF3F9F-1200x675.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px&quot;/&gt;Hoo, boy.
&lt;p&gt;The point I was hoping (but probably failed) to make, is that there are many thousands of way smarter people inside Apple than me, and a frightening, pop-up frenzy that will absolutely condition non-technical users to blindly click “Allow” is the best solution they could arrive at or ship in time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they did countless user studies and determined this really is the safest and best approach. But I doubt it. I think it was a combination of poor management, hard deadlines, and probably a cavalcade of upper management and C-level executives who only use iOS as their daily driver and simply lack the imagination, experience, and technical vision to realize a modal pop-up flow that (kind of) works on a touch device does not scale to an overlapping, multiple-window, keyboard and cursor driven interface, i.e., the desktop computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Security”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me go ahead and silence the Hacker News crowd and openly admit that, yes, I’m a geek, a developer, a technical person, and most definitely not a normal user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there needs to be an I’m-Not-A-Dummy switch in System Preferences because all my shit’s broken and I can find zero guidance from Apple on how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of background jobs and processes on my iMac, which I basically treat as an always-on, home server. Some are run via &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt;, others by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;. Some are run under my user account, others as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an AppleScript that runs every ten minutes and downloads photos from a server and imports them into Photos.app. After upgrading to Catalina, it failed every time. I stopped &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; so I could debug and run it manually. The first time I execute it, Terminal.app asks for permission to access my &lt;code&gt;~/Photos&lt;/code&gt; directory. OK. Then it prompts to allow Terminal.app to control Photos.app. OK. And, finally, and I’m not sure why given I already granted permission for the &lt;code&gt;~/Photos&lt;/code&gt; directory, it asks for permission to control Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1420&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-4.16.16-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;iTerm would like to control Finder&quot; width=&quot;1064&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-4.16.16-PM.png 1064w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-4.16.16-PM-300x164.png 300w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-4.16.16-PM-768x419.png 768w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-4.16.16-PM-1024x558.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1064px) 100vw, 1064px&quot;/&gt;iTerm would like to control Finder
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all those permissions granted, I add a few log statements and turn &lt;code&gt;cron &lt;/code&gt;back on. The job runs. And fails. Again. Because even though I granted permission moments ago, now that it’s being run in a slightly different way, Catalina decides to lock it down again. How is this decided by macOS and how do I fix it? My googling has failed me so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next. Because I’m an idiot with reasons, I have a python daemon that launches as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt; and remains running in the background. It is now silently failing because it isn’t allowed to access an external USB drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and while debugging the AppleScript example from a paragraph above, every time I saved my &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; changes in &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;, the system would throw up a dialog asking for my permission to allow Terminal to modify, you know, my own personal crontab that I explicitly invoked an editing session of. (Although I’m pretty sure this was also a thing in Mojave. But the point still stands.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess Apple is trying to protect less-technical customers who might inadvertently install a malicious recurring background process as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;? Or accidentally read a file from an external volume while running a shell script that this non-technical user opened up a Terminal, edited, made executable, and invoked themselves? I suppose there’s an attack vector there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iCloud Password Shenanigans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After upgrading to Catalina, like basically every other recent macOS release, I found myself logged out of iCloud. Facebook and Gmail have never once in my life expired my session on purpose. But since my iCloud data is stored on an encrypted, non-removable hard drive, protected by a T2 chip and biometric security, I can see why it’s best if Apple logs me out every time I install a software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. Fine. I’ll log back in, but &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; iCloud rejects my password in System Preferences so many times that they eventually lock me out and force me through a forgot password flow just so I can change my password back to what it always was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That done and finally logged back in, all of my iOS devices start beeping and I find this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1421&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PNG-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Apple ID is being used on a new device apparently.&quot; width=&quot;1125&quot; height=&quot;728&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PNG-image.png 1125w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PNG-image-300x194.png 300w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PNG-image-768x497.png 768w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PNG-image-1024x663.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px&quot;/&gt;My Apple ID is being used on a new device apparently.
&lt;p&gt;To be expected given that I just logged in on a new(?) device. But, why is my iMac’s hostname now duplicated “(2)”? Reasons, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Account Password Shenanigans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Catalina upgrade and spending some time getting my apps, settings, etc. kind of back to normal, my wife tried to login to her account on that iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything went fine, and we got some of her software updated, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the Mac went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her local Mac account password is a simple, all-lowercase English word without spaces or numbers or special characters. macOS wouldn’t accept it when she tried to login again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t accept it when I typed it in. Nor when I decided the keyboard must have somehow malfunctioned during the last half hour and I thought I was extremely clever by trying to login as her via a remote screen sharing session and it failed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was about 36 hours ago and the problem persists through multiple restarts. I don’t have it in me right now to try and debug this. But I’m not worried. All of her data is backed up. I’m ready to blow away her account and create a new one. But,…Apple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Photos.app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took around eight hours for Photos.app to upgrade my 200GB iCloud Photos library the first time I opened it on Catalina. Since then, across multiple reboots, it simply refuses to update with new photos added to iCloud from other devices. Or upload new photos to iCloud that I imported directly on that machine. It just says “Updating…”, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Little Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found earlier today that I couldn’t restart my Mac because an application was still running. The only thing open (but idle) was Xcode. I did a quick ⌥⌘⎋ and discovered this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1417&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-7.17.33-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;System Preferences is not responding&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;838&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-7.17.33-PM.png 900w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-7.17.33-PM-300x279.png 300w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-7.17.33-PM-768x715.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot;/&gt;System Preferences is not responding
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea System Preferences was even running. It wasn’t visible in the Dock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I had to sign in to iCloud again (a few times) after upgrading. A day later, this popped up while I was using TextMate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1418&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48E8023F-8E4E-4889-88C9-5F946E4AEDE8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Can't connect to FaceTime&quot; width=&quot;1064&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48E8023F-8E4E-4889-88C9-5F946E4AEDE8.jpeg 1064w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48E8023F-8E4E-4889-88C9-5F946E4AEDE8-300x151.jpeg 300w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48E8023F-8E4E-4889-88C9-5F946E4AEDE8-768x387.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/48E8023F-8E4E-4889-88C9-5F946E4AEDE8-1024x516.jpeg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1064px) 100vw, 1064px&quot;/&gt;Can't connect to FaceTime
&lt;p&gt;🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After upgrading to Catalina, macOS made me reauthorize every app that wanted to send me notifications. Ironically, the following alert appears &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; I reboot despite always dismissing it using the most definitive option Apple provides and never giving whatever-process-is-showing-it permission to notify me of anything in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1419&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-7.19.47-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Welcome to macOS Catalina. You're in for a treat!&quot; width=&quot;764&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-7.19.47-PM.png 764w, https://cdn.tyler.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-7.19.47-PM-300x79.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px&quot;/&gt;Welcome to macOS Catalina. You're in for a treat!
&lt;h2&gt;Anyway…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the Mac and everything its software and hardware stand for. The iMac Pro and new Mac mini are phenomenal. The revamped Mac Pro (six years? really?) is a damn beast. And, honestly, I don’t even mind USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the keyboards, the literally hundreds if not thousands of predatory scams on the Mac App Store, whatever the fuck is going on with Messages.app on macOS, iCloud Drive, the boneheaded, arrogant, literally-put-on-the-consumer-facing-marketing-website claim that iPad-to-Mac with Catalyst was merely a checkbox, all the dumb, stupid little bugs I mentioned above, and the truckload of other paper-cuts I’m sure to run into once I’m on Catalina for more than 48 hours…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely clear that the Mac is far outside of what the upper-ranks of Apple is focusing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to throw Engineering under the bus. I’m friends with many wonderful, talented, hard-working, and caring Apple developers who want the Mac to &lt;em&gt;fucking thrive&lt;/em&gt;. What I am doing is explicitly shitting on management and blaming the executive team for allowing all of the above to ship.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Since deep learning regained prominence in 2012, many machine learning frameworks have clamored to become the new favorite among researchers and industry practitioners. From the early academic outputs Caffe and Theano to the massive industry-backed PyTorch and TensorFlow, this deluge of options makes it difficult to keep track of what the most popular frameworks actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only browsed Reddit, you might assume that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/b6wgmo/d_tensorflow_is_dead_long_live_tensorflow/&quot;&gt;everyone’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7ziagd/d_discussion_on_pytorch_vs_tensorflow/&quot;&gt;switching&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/bo0nxh/d_what_are_you_using_tensorflow_vs_pytorch/&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/9kys38/r_frameworks_mentioned_iclr_20182019_tensorflow/&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;. Judging instead by Francois Chollet’s Twitter, TensorFlow/Keras may appear as the dominant framework while PyTorch’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1047983588761788416&quot;&gt;momentum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1029844660733136896&quot;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1047570406570307584&quot;&gt;stalling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, &lt;strong&gt;the war for ML frameworks has two remaining main contenders: PyTorch and TensorFlow&lt;/strong&gt;. My analysis suggests that researchers are abandoning TensorFlow and flocking to PyTorch in droves. Meanwhile in industry, Tensorflow is currently the platform of choice, but that may not be true for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine the data. The graph below shows the ratio between PyTorch papers and papers that use either Tensorflow or PyTorch at each of the top research conferences over time. All the lines &lt;strong&gt;slope upward&lt;/strong&gt;, and every major conference in 2019 has had a &lt;strong&gt;majority of papers&lt;/strong&gt; implemented in PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/10/ratio_medium-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;ratio_medium-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;Conference legend CVPR, ICCV, ECCV - computer vision conferences&lt;br/&gt;NAACL, ACL, EMNLP - NLP conferences&lt;br/&gt;ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS - general ML conferences&lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;Details on the data collection process This graph was generated by scraping every paper published in a major ML conference over the last few years. Papers were categorized based on whether they mention PyTorch or TensorFlow, excluding papers with authors affiliated with either Google or Facebook, as well as those that mention both Tensorflow and PyTorch. An ablation of these factors can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/p/cef6dd26-f952-4265-a2bc-f8bfb9eb1efb/&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactive versions of these figures can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://chillee.github.io/pytorch-vs-tensorflow/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need more evidence of how fast PyTorch has gained traction in the research community, here's a graph of the raw counts of PyTorch vs. TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ACL&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ICLR&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-1.9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ICML&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;69&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32.5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 2018, PyTorch was a minority. Now, it is an overwhelming majority&lt;/strong&gt;, with 69% of CVPR using PyTorch, 75+% of both NAACL and ACL, and 50+% of ICLR and ICML. While PyTorch’s dominance is strongest at vision and language conferences (outnumbering TensorFlow by 2:1 and 3:1 respectively), PyTorch is also more popular than TensorFlow at general machine learning conferences like ICLR and ICML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some believe that PyTorch is still an upstart framework trying to carve out a niche in a TensorFlow-dominated world, the data tells a different story. At no conference except ICML has the growth of TensorFlow even &lt;em&gt;kept up&lt;/em&gt; with the overall paper growth. At NAACL, ICLR, and ACL, TensorFlow actually has &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; papers this year than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not PyTorch that needs to be afraid of its future, it’s TensorFlow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whydoresearcherslovepytorch&quot;&gt;Why do researchers love PyTorch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s similar to numpy, very pythonic, and integrates easily with the rest of the Python ecosystem. For example, you can simply throw in a pdb breakpoint anywhere into your PyTorch model and it’ll work. In TensorFlow, debugging the model requires an active session and ends up being much trickier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great API.&lt;/strong&gt; Most researchers prefer PyTorch’s API to TensorFlow’s API. This is partially because PyTorch is better designed and partially because TensorFlow has handicapped itself by switching APIs so many times (e.g. ‘layers’ -&amp;gt; ‘slim’ -&amp;gt; ‘estimators’ -&amp;gt; ‘tf.keras’).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite the fact that PyTorch’s dynamic graphs give strictly less opportunity for optimization, there have been many anecdotal reports that PyTorch is as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/cvcbu6/d_why_is_pytorch_as_fast_as_and_sometimes_faster/&quot;&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt; if not &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07249&quot;&gt;faster&lt;/a&gt; than TensorFlow. It's not clear if this is really true, but at the very least, TensorFlow hasn't gained a decisive advantage in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;whatdoesthefutureholdfortensorflowinresearch&quot;&gt;What does the future hold for TensorFlow in research?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if TensorFlow has reached parity with PyTorch functionality-wise, PyTorch has already reached a majority of the community. That means that PyTorch implementations will be easier to find, that authors will be more incentivized to publish code in PyTorch (so people will use it), and that your collaborators will be most likely prefer PyTorch. Thus, any migration back to TensorFlow 2.0 is likely to be slow, if it occurs at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TensorFlow will always have a captive audience within Google/DeepMind, but I wonder whether Google will eventually relax this. Even now, many of the researchers that Google wants to recruit will already prefer PyTorch at varying levels, and I’ve heard grumblings that many researchers inside Google would like to use a framework other than TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, PyTorch’s dominance might start to cut off Google researchers from the rest of the research community. Not only will they have a harder time building on top of outside research, outside researchers will also be less likely to build on top of code published by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether TensorFlow 2.0 will allow TensorFlow to recover some of its research audience. Although eager mode will certainly be appealing, the same can’t be said about the Keras API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although PyTorch is now dominant in research, a quick glance at industry shows that TensorFlow is still the dominant framework. For example, based on data  from 2018 to 2019, TensorFlow had 1541 new job listings vs. 1437 job listings for PyTorch on public job boards, 3230 new TensorFlow Medium articles vs. 1200 PyTorch, 13.7k new GitHub stars for TensorFlow vs 7.2k for PyTorch, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if PyTorch has become so popular for researchers, why hasn’t it seen the same success in industry? An obvious first answer is simply inertia. TensorFlow came out years before PyTorch, and industry is slower to adopt new technologies than researchers. The other reason is that TensorFlow has been better than PyTorch for production. But what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that, we need to know how the needs of researchers and industry differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers care about how fast they can iterate on their research, which is typically on relatively small datasets (datasets that can fit on one machine) and run on &amp;lt;8 GPUs. This is not typically gated heavily by performance considerations, but by their ability to quickly implement new ideas. On the other hand, industry considers performance to be of the utmost priority. While 10% faster runtime means nothing to a researcher, that could directly translate to millions of savings for a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difference is deployment. Researchers will run experiments on their own machines or on a server cluster somewhere that’s dedicated for running research jobs. On the other hand, industry has a litany of restrictions/requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Python.&lt;/strong&gt; Some companies will run servers for which the overhead of the Python runtime is too much to take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile.&lt;/strong&gt; You can’t embed a Python interpreter in your mobile binary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving.&lt;/strong&gt; A catch-all for features like no-downtime updates of models, switching between models seamlessly, batching at prediction time, and etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;TensorFlow was built specifically around these requirements, and has solutions for all these issues: the graph format and execution engine natively has no need for Python, and TensorFlow Lite and TensorFlow Serving address mobile and serving considerations respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, PyTorch has fallen short in catering to these considerations, and as a result most companies are currently using TensorFlow in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;frameworkconvergence&quot;&gt;Framework “Convergence”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of 2018, two major events threw a wrench into the story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;PyTorch introduced the JIT compiler and “TorchScript,” thus introducing graph-based features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TensorFlow announced they were moving to eager mode by default in 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, these were moves attempting to address their respective weaknesses. So what exactly are these features, and what do they have to offer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pytorchtorchscript&quot;&gt;PyTorch TorchScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyTorch JIT is an intermediate representation (IR) for PyTorch called TorchScript. TorchScript is the “graph” representation of PyTorch. You can turn a regular PyTorch model into TorchScript by using either tracing or script mode. Tracing takes a function and an input, records the operations that were executed with that input, and constructs the IR. Although straightforward, tracing has its downsides. For example, it can’t capture control flow that didn’t execute. For example, it can’t capture the false block of a conditional if it executed the true block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Script mode takes a function/class, reinterprets the Python code and directly outputs the TorchScript IR. This allows it to support arbitrary code, however it essentially needs to reinterpret Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/10/pasted-image-0--6-.png&quot; alt=&quot;pasted-image-0--6-&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your PyTorch model is in this IR, we gain all the benefits of graph mode. We can &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html&quot;&gt;deploy PyTorch models in C++&lt;/a&gt; without a Python dependency , or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/blog/optimizing-cuda-rnn-with-torchscript/&quot;&gt;optimize it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tensorfloweager&quot;&gt;Tensorflow Eager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the API level, TensorFlow eager mode is essentially identical to PyTorch’s eager mode, originally made popular by Chainer. This gives TensorFlow most of the advantages of PyTorch’s eager mode (ease of use, debuggability, and etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this also gives TensorFlow the same disadvantages. TensorFlow eager models can’t be exported to a non-Python environment, they can’t be optimized, they can’t run on mobile, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts TensorFlow in the same position as PyTorch, and they resolve it in essentially the same way - you can trace your code (tf.function) or reinterpret the Python code (Autograph).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/10/pasted-image-0--7-.png&quot; alt=&quot;pasted-image-0--7-&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, TensorFlow’s eager mode does not truly give you the “best of both worlds”. Although it’s true that you can turn your eager code into a static graph with tf.function annotations, this is never going to be a seamless process (PyTorch’s TorchScript has a similar issue). Tracing is fundamentally limited, and reinterpreting Python code essentially requires rewriting much of the Python compiler. Of course, the scope is massively simplified by restricting to the subset of Python that’s used in deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In enabling Eager mode by default, TensorFlow forces a choice onto their users - use eager execution for ease of use and require a rewrite for deployment, or don’t use eager execution at all. While this is the same situation that PyTorch is in, the opt-in nature of PyTorch’s TorchScript is likely to be more palatable than TensorFlow’s “Eager by default”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;currentstateofmlframeworks&quot;&gt;Current State of ML Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus we arrive at the current state of ML frameworks. PyTorch has the research market, and is trying to extend this success to industry. TensorFlow is trying to stem its losses in the research community without sacrificing too much of its production capabilities. It will certainly take a long time before PyTorch can make a meaningful impact in industry - TensorFlow is too entrenched and industry moves slowly. However, the transition from TensorFlow 1.0 to 2.0 will be difficult and provides a natural point for companies to evaluate PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future will come down to who can best answer the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much will researcher preference affect industry?&lt;/strong&gt; As the current crop of PhD’s starts to graduate, they’ll bring PyTorch with them. Is this preference strong enough that companies will choose PyTorch for hiring purposes? Will graduates start startups that are built on top of PyTorch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can TensorFlow’s eager mode catch up to PyTorch in usability?&lt;/strong&gt; My impression from issue trackers and online communities is that TensorFlow Eager suffers heavily from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/30596&quot;&gt;performance/memory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6XcP4JOHmk&amp;amp;t=1h12m46s&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and that Autograph has its own share of issues. Google will be spending a large amount of engineering effort, but TensorFlow is encumbered with historical baggage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How fast can PyTorch get to a production state?&lt;/strong&gt; There are still many fundamental issues that PyTorch hasn’t addressed - no good quantization story, no mobile, serving, and etc. Until these are resolved, PyTorch won’t even be an option for many companies. Can PyTorch offer a compelling enough story for companies to make the switch? &lt;em&gt;Note: The day this article was released, PyTorch announced support for both quantization and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/mobile/home/&quot;&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt;. Both are still experimental, but represent significant progress on this front for PyTorch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Google’s isolation in industry hurt it?&lt;/strong&gt; One of the primary reasons Google pushes for TensorFlow is to help its burgeoning cloud service. Since Google is trying to own the entire ML vertical, this incentivizes the companies Google is competing with (Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia) to support the only alternative machine learning framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps under appreciated how much machine learning frameworks shape ML research. They don’t just enable machine learning research, they &lt;em&gt;enable and restrict the ideas that researchers are able to easily explore&lt;/em&gt;. How many nascent ideas are crushed simply because there is no easy way to express them in a framework? PyTorch may have reached the local minima for research, but it is worth examining what other frameworks offer, and what research opportunities they may expose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;higherorderdifferentiation&quot;&gt;Higher Order Differentiation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their core, PyTorch and Tensorflow are auto-differentiation frameworks. That is, they allow one to take the derivative of some function. However, there are many ways to enable auto-differentiation, and the particular implementation that most modern ML frameworks choose is called “reverse-mode auto-differentiation”, more commonly known as “backpropagation”. This implementation turns out to be extremely efficient for taking the derivative of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things change for computing higher order derivatives (Hessian/Hessian Vector Products). Computing these efficiently requires what’s known as “forward-mode auto-differentiation”. Without this capability, computing Hessian Vector Products can be orders of magnitude slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Jax. Jax is built by the same people who built the original Autograd, and features both forward- and reverse-mode auto-differentiation. This allows computation of higher order derivatives orders of magnitude faster than what PyTorch/TensorFlow can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jax offers more than just higher order derivatives, however. The Jax developers view Jax as a framework for composing arbitrary functional transformations, including &lt;code&gt;vmap&lt;/code&gt; (for automatic batching) or &lt;code&gt;pmap&lt;/code&gt; (for automatic parallelization).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original autograd had its devoted followers (11 papers at ICML used it despite having no GPU support), and it’s likely that Jax will soon pick up a similar devoted community, using it for all sorts of n-th order derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;codegeneration&quot;&gt;Code Generation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run a PyTorch/TensorFlow model, most of the work isn’t actually being done in the framework itself, but rather by third party kernels. These kernels are often provided by the hardware vendor, and consist of operator libraries that higher-level frameworks can take advantage of. These are things like MKLDNN (for CPU) or cuDNN (for Nvidia GPUs). Higher-level frameworks break their computational graphs into chunks, which can then call these computational libraries. These libraries represent thousands of man hours of effort, and are often optimized for the architecture and application to yield the best performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, recent interest in non-standard hardware, sparse/quantized tensors, and new operators have exposed a major flaw in relying on these operator libraries: they’re inflexible. What if you want to use a new operator in your research like capsule networks? What if you want to run your model on a new hardware accelerator that ML frameworks don’t have good support for? Existing solutions often fall short. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3321441&quot;&gt;this paper recently pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, existing implementations of Capsule Networks on GPUs are 2 orders of magnitude slower than an optimal implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each new hardware architecture, category of tensor, or operator, greatly increases the difficulty of this problem. There have been a number of tools that tackle different aspects (Halide, TVM, PlaidML, Tensor Comprehensions, XLA, Taco, etc), but the correct approach still remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without more work put into solving this problem, we run the risk of overfitting our ML research to the tools we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are exciting times for the future of TensorFlow and PyTorch. Their designs have converged to such a point that neither framework will have a decisive win by virtue of its design. Each have their respective territories marked out -- one side owns research, the other side owns industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, between PyTorch and TensorFlow, I’d give the edge to PyTorch. Machine learning is still a research driven field. Industry can’t afford to ignore research output, and as long as PyTorch dominates research, that will pressure companies to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it isn't merely the frameworks that move fast. Machine learning research itself is also in a massive state of flux. Not only do the frameworks change - the models/hardware/paradigms used in 5 years may look drastically different than the ones we have today. Perhaps the battle between PyTorch and TensorFlow will become irrelevant as another computing model becomes dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of all these conflicting interests, and all the money thrown around machine learning, it's nice to take a step back. Most of us don't work on machine learning software for the money or to assist in our company's strategic plans. &lt;strong&gt;We work in machine learning because we care&lt;/strong&gt; - about advancing machine learning research, about democratizing AI, or maybe just about building cool stuff. Whether you prefer TensorFlow or PyTorch, we're all just trying to make machine learning software the best it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'd like to thank Isay Katsman, Zaibo Wang, and Rishi Bommasani for their feedback on the data collection process. Also thanks to Adithya Ganesh, Hugh Zhang, Steven Ban, and Grace Lin for their editing advice. Finally, I'd like to thank both the PyTorch team and the TensorFlow team for doing so much to advance ML research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;System76&lt;/span&gt;, the Denver-based &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/span&gt; PC manufacturer and developer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/07/17/these-windows-10-vs-pop-os-benchmarks-reveal-a-surprising-truth-about-linux-gaming-performance/#32fa9b5b5e74&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Pop OS&lt;/a&gt;, has some stellar news for those of us who prefer our laptops a little more open. Later this month the company will begin shipping two of their laptop models with its Coreboot-powered open source firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d9ee75d67dd830006a31931/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;The Darter Pro laptop&quot; data-height=&quot;669&quot; data-width=&quot;1319&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;The Darter Pro laptop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;System76&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning today, System76 will start taking pre-orders for both the Galago Pro and Darter Pro laptops. The systems will ship out later in October, and include the company’s Coreboot-based open source firmware which was previously teased at the 2019 Open Source &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;Firmware&lt;/span&gt; Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Coreboot, formerly known as LinuxBIOS, is a &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;software project&lt;/span&gt; aimed at replacing proprietary firmware found in most computers with a lightweight firmware designed to perform only the minimum number of tasks necessary to load and run a modern 32-bit or 64-bit &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;operating system&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s so great about ripping out the proprietary firmware included in machines like this and replacing it with an open alternative? To begin with, it’s leaner. System76 claims that users can boot from power off to the desktop 29% faster with its Coreboot-based firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d9f438f6f22b20007ac4904/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Open Source Firmware is now available on these System76 laptops&quot; data-height=&quot;658&quot; data-width=&quot;1401&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Open Source Firmware is now available on these System76 laptops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;small&gt;System76&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also been stripped of unnecessary features like execution environments, resulting in firmware – and by extension an entire system – that is less vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;embed-base quote-embed embed-3 bg-accent color-base font-accent&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source firmware was the last spark to power our journey towards creating entirely free and open technology. Like the universe, we are ever-expanding into an open source future with ongoing progress in hardware, software, and firmware, and we’re excited to see where our journey goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;System76 Spokesperson&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move continues the company’s steady march toward offering &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;open source software&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; hardware (see: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/11/01/system76-debuts-thelio-open-hardware-pc-but-what-does-that-mean/#38d1fbea1fbd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;Thelio daughterboard&lt;/a&gt;). It is also working on a &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;graphical &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;firmware manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to benefit more than just System76 and Pop OS users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;header class=&quot;color-base&quot;&gt;System76 Launches A Graphical Firmware Manager Compatible With LVFS, All Ubuntu And Debian Distros&lt;/header&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;color-base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;provider-name&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;author-name&quot;&gt;Jason Evangelho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Darter Pro and Galago Pro&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these laptops can be kitted out with 10th-Generation &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/span&gt; CPUs (specifically the i5-10210U and the i7-10510U), and both have glare-resistant matte 1080p IPS displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning at $949, the Galago Pro features an all-aluminum chassis, a wealth of connectivity options including HDMI, DisplayPort to USB-C and Thunderbolt, and can be configured with up to 32GB of &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; and up to 6TB of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Darter Pro, meanwhile, can be built out with 32GB of RAM and up to 2TB of storage, and features up to 10 hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’re reading this, both machines should be &lt;a href=&quot;https://system76.com/laptops&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;up for pre-order now&lt;/a&gt; with System76’s Coreboot-powered open source firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;Coreboot&lt;/span&gt; Ship On Other System76 Machines?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;Don Watkins&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://OpenSource.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-link&quot;&gt;OpenSource.com&lt;/a&gt; asked this question, and System76 responded by saying: “Yes. Long term, System76 is working to open source all aspects of the computer. &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;Thelio Io&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class=&quot;stats-entity-name&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt; board in the Thelio desktop, is both open hardware and open firmware. This is a long journey but we're picking up speed. It's been less than a year since the our open hardware Thelio desktop was released and we're now producing two laptops with System76 Open Firmware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What About A System76 Machine I Already Own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the company about the possibility of users installing the Coreboot open firmware on their existing System76 machines. Here’s the official answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At this time, open firmware will only be available on the new Galago (galp4) and Darter Pro (darp6). System76 is looking into the ability to bring open firmware to our our previous models but we do not know when or if this will be an option. Should it become available, we will update our customers on these products with a firmware update using our firmware manager to move them to open firmware.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;font-bold text-purple&quot;&gt;Can I scrape password protected stuff with Spider?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt-4 leading-normal&quot;&gt;Yes! It’s a browser extension, so as long as you log in first, you can scrape whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;font-bold text-purple&quot;&gt;Can I scrape in? Like, can I automatically scrape the product detail page from the product list page?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt-4 leading-normal&quot;&gt;Not right now, but we might implement something to do this in the future. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/iDKlQocw/spider-pro-public-board&quot;&gt;Spider Road Map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;font-bold text-purple&quot;&gt;Clicking the Next button is tedious when scraping paginated results. Why don’t you just automate it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt-4 leading-normal&quot;&gt;Our goal with the browser extension is to mimic manual use when it makes sense, while still saving of time and keeping things organized. Automating things in this way could put load on servers in a way that a manual user couldn’t, and we don’t want to enable that behavior. That being said, we would like to improve this experience in the future, so keep an eye on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/iDKlQocw/spider-pro-public-board&quot;&gt;Road Map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has removed from its App Store a smartphone app used by Hong Kong pro-democracy activists to crowdsource the location of protesters and police, after Chinese state media suggested the tech giant was aiding &quot;rioters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple initially rejected the app last week, saying that it &quot;encourages an activity that is not legal,&quot; and allows users to &quot;evade law enforcement,&quot; according to its developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res768841932&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap statichtml&quot; readability=&quot;8.4505813953488&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;10.328488372093&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&quot;Your app contains content - or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity - that is not legal ... Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; assume our user are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
— HKmap.live 全港抗爭即時地圖 (@hkmaplive) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hkmaplive/status/1179108329240424448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, HKmap.live did briefly become available in the App Store before Apple announced Wednesday that it was being removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong,&quot; Apple said in a statement. &quot;Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app, it said, &quot;has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKmap.live reportedly consolidates reports from social media and then uses the information to plot the locations of protests and such information as where police are using tear gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protesters have staged months of protests in the former British colony, demanding universal suffrage and the right to choose Hong Kong's leadership. The level of violence has grown in recent weeks, with protesters wrecking store fronts and hurling gasoline bombs. Police have responded with tear gas, batons and, in some cases, live ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, an editorial that appeared in China's official &lt;em&gt;People's Daily&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.people.cn/n3/2019/1009/c90000-9620878.html&quot;&gt;called out developers&lt;/a&gt; of HKmap.live for providing a &quot;'navigation service' for the rioters.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Apple chose to approve the app in the App Store in Hong Kong at this point,&quot; the editorial said. &quot;Does this mean Apple intended to be an accomplice to the rioters?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[P]eople have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts,&quot; it said. &quot;Apple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to Apple's decision to withdraw the app, its developers, who have not identified themselves because of security concerns, responded in a series of tweets on Thursday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3032310/about-face-apple-removes-hong-kong-protest-map-app-following-china&quot;&gt;reports The South China Morning Post&lt;/a&gt;, a Hong Kong-based English-language daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We once believed the App rejection [was] simply a bureaucratic f up but now it is clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human rights in Hong Kong,&quot; the developers said, according to the &lt;em&gt;Post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although HKmap.live has been removed from Apple's App Store, it remains available on an independent website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong unrest is a sensitive issue in Beijing and anyone seen as showing sympathy or support for the protesters has come in for sharp criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey touched off a heated controversy by tweeting support for the Hong Kong protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he quickly deleted the tweet and expressed contrition, that didn't stop the Chinese Basketball Association from suspending its business dealings with the Rockets. Tencent, a Chinese media partner with the NBA in China, also ended a streaming deal worth $1.5 billion and China's state television said it would stop airing Rockets games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 4:05 p.m. ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, doctors in the U.S. have used the powerful gene-editing technique CRISPR to try to treat a patient with a genetic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is just amazing how far things have come,&quot; says Victoria Gray, 34, of Forest, Miss. &quot;It is wonderful,&quot; she told NPR in an exclusive interview after undergoing the landmark treatment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/facts.html&quot;&gt;sickle cell disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray is the first patient ever to be publicly identified as being involved in a study testing the use of CRISPR for a genetic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I always had hoped that something will come along,&quot; she says from a hospital bed at the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, Tenn., where she received an infusion of billions of genetically modified cells. &quot;It's a good time to get healed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container medium btmbar&quot; id=&quot;con746389044&quot; previewtitle=&quot;Listen to the latest developments from Rob Stein&quot;&gt;

&lt;article id=&quot;res746403668&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap resaudio container insecure&quot; aria-label=&quot;audio-module&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;audio-module&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;audio-module-title&quot;&gt;In A 1st, Doctors In U.S. Use CRISPR Tool To Treat Patient With Genetic Disorder&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it probably will take months, if not years, of careful monitoring of Gray and other patients before doctors know whether the treatment is safe and how well it might be helping patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle cell affects millions of people around the world. About 100,000 are in the U.S., and most of them, like Gray, are African American. A genetic defect causes bone marrow to produce a defective protein that makes blood cells that are sickle-shaped, hard and sticky. The deformed cells get stuck inside blood vessels and don't carry oxygen normally, causing a host of debilitating and, often, eventually life-shortening complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's horrible,&quot; Gray says. &quot;When you can't walk or lift up a spoon to feed yourself, it gets real hard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, doctors are using cells taken from patients' own bone marrow that have been genetically modified with CRISPR to make them produce a protein that is usually only made by fetuses and by babies for a short time following birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res745720307&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage736297990&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/01/736297990/scientists-make-model-embryos-from-stem-cells-to-study-key-steps-in-human-develo&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2019\/07\/01\/736297990\/scientists-make-model-embryos-from-stem-cells-to-study-key-steps-in-human-develo&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/06/28/figure2-3-_sq-e887674963c0f156dbdc5f6db9d89e96c6769742-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/06/28/figure2-3-_sq-e887674963c0f156dbdc5f6db9d89e96c6769742-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Scientists Make Model Embryos From Stem Cells To Study Key Steps In Human Development&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is this protein will compensate for the defective protein that causes sickle cell disease and will enable patients to live normally for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's exciting to see that we might be on the cusp of a highly effective therapy for patients with sickle cell,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vrtx.com/leadership/david-altshuler-md-phd&quot;&gt;Dr. David Altshuler&lt;/a&gt;, executive vice president, global research and chief scientific officer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vrtx.com/&quot;&gt;Vertex Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; in Boston. Vertex is conducting the study with CRISPR Therapeutics of Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR Therapeutics announced the treatment of the first volunteer on Monday but did not name the patient. However, NPR got exclusive access to Gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People with sickle cell disease have been waiting a long time for therapies that just let them live a normal life,&quot; Altshuler says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a very big deal,&quot; agrees &lt;a href=&quot;https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__tristarchildrensspecialists.com_physicians_profile_Haydar-2DAdib-2DFrangoul-2DMD&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=9fZnZOgPWmHmvevlab4V4DSjtBMjorSlbQYfK_MauDg&amp;amp;r=PZuRRy00Xeju5PmG1SquClVDEVWncsxG3_XpmKHQA_Ly8uUpeDNmv7YYm-Po6T8i&amp;amp;m=w9oA09oSmqKFvF-lDRpCbyyoct5HhKuaEKZ3x1gXRgc&amp;amp;s=EqYegb0QQM0aFFJM-0CPTm14pQJ5CIV79vOsRo3pIi8&amp;amp;e=&quot;&gt;Dr. Haydar Frangoul&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of pediatric hematology/oncology at the institute where Gray volunteered. &quot;This could benefit many patients.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frangoul's center, Sarah Cannon, is conducting the study at HCA Healthcare's TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, which is one of eight sites recruiting patients for the research in the United States, Canada and Europe. Up to 45 patients ages 18 to 35 will eventually be enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other doctors, scientists and bioethicists are also encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is an exciting moment in medicine. CRISPR promises the capacity to alter the human genome and to begin to directly address genetic diseases,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://divinity.uchicago.edu/laurie-zoloth&quot;&gt;Laurie Zoloth&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Zoloth is also cautious. She worries that this and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/16/712402435/first-u-s-patients-treated-with-crispr-as-gene-editing-human-trials-get-underway&quot;&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; starting up using CRISPR haven't gone through an extra &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1810628&quot;&gt;layer of scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; by a panel of outside experts assembled by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This a brand-new technology,&quot; Zoloth says. &quot;It seems to work really well in animals and really well in culture dishes. It's completely unknown how it works in actual human beings. So there are a lot of unknowns. It might make you sicker.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frangoul acknowledges there are always risks with experimental treatments. But he says the research will go very slowly and carefully with close review by the Food and Drug Administration and other advisory panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are very cautious about how we do this trial in a very systematic way to monitor the patients carefully for any complications related to the therapy,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her part, Gray says she understands there are risks. She also says that she knows the study is a first step and that other patients might only see benefits years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This gives me hope if it gives me nothing else,&quot; Gray says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will probably take several months before doctors detect the first signs of whether the genetically edited cells are producing helpful levels of the protein and even longer to know whether the cells are improving patients' health. And it will likely take many years to know whether the benefits last a lifetime, as hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray, who is married and has four children, was diagnosed with sickle cell disease when she was an infant and started crying during a bath. One major symptom is agonizing, debilitating pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many sickle cell patients, her symptoms have prevented her from living a full life. She couldn't play like other children, was afraid to travel and had to give up her dreams of becoming a doctor or a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sometimes it feels like lightning strikes in my chest and real sharp pains all over,&quot; Gray says. &quot;Sometimes, I will be just balled up and crying, not able to do anything for myself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defective blood cells also increase the risk for infections and damage to vital organs such as the heart. They also can cause life-threatening strokes. Many people with sickle cell disease don't live past their 40s. Gray's heart has already suffered damage. And that is taking an additional psychological toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's scary,&quot; she says, describing how her disease has affected her oldest son, 12-year-old Jamarius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He's older, so he understands. So he started acting out in school. And his teacher told me, 'I believe Jamarius is acting out because he really believes you're going to die,' &quot; Gray says, choking back tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients can get bone marrow transplants, but those procedures are grueling and can be dangerous if the immune system cells produced by the transplanted bone marrow attack their bodies. And most sickle cell patients either don't have or don't find a suitable donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's real hard,&quot; Gray says. &quot;It was just my religion that just kept me going.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was considering a bone marrow transplant, she heard about the CRISPR trial and jumped at the chance to volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I always knew something had to come along and that God had something important in store for me,&quot; Gray says. &quot;It felt like this was meant to be. It was kinda fate. That was an amazing feeling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR enables scientists to make very precise changes in DNA, raising hopes it will lead to new ways to prevent and treat many diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;CRISPR technology has a lot of potential use in the future, not only in blood disorders,&quot; Frangoul says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors have already started using it to try treat cancer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/02/21/585336506/doctors-in-china-lead-race-to-treat-cancer-by-editing-genes&quot;&gt;mostly in China&lt;/a&gt;. At least two patients in the U.S. have been treated for cancer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03399448?cond=crispr&amp;amp;draw=2&amp;amp;rank=3&quot;&gt;in a study at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this year, doctors in Boston &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03872479?cond=crispr&amp;amp;draw=2&amp;amp;rank=15&quot;&gt;are planning to use CRISPR to edit cells in patients' retinas&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes of restoring vision in patients with an inherited form of blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

She was considering a bone marrow transplant when she heard about the CRISPR study and jumped at the chance to volunteer. &lt;strong class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Meredith Rizzo/NPR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;hide-caption&quot;&gt;hide caption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Meredith Rizzo/NPR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies sponsoring the sickle cell study &lt;a href=&quot;http://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-and-vertex-announce-progress-clinical&quot;&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that they had used CRISPR to treat the first patient with a similar blood disorder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beta-thalassemia&quot;&gt;beta thalassemia&lt;/a&gt;, in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, CRISPR Therapeutics also revealed the first hint that the approach might be working for beta thalassemia. The beta thalassemia patient's edited cells have started functioning in the bone marrow, according to the company's press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, that patient has not required a blood transfusion for more than four months, the company says. Beta thalassemia patients normally require regular transfusions to treat their condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease are both caused by genetic defects that cause problems with a protein called hemoglobin. Healthy red blood cells use hemoglobin to carry oxygen throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle cell patients' red blood cells carry defective hemoglobin that deform the cells and don't transport enough oxygen. The hope is that another form of hemoglobin, known as fetal hemoglobin, will compensate for the defective protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fetal hemoglobin is produced by fetuses in the womb to provide oxygen. In most people, fetal hemoglobin production stops shortly after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once a baby is born, a switch will flip on,&quot; Frangoul says. &quot;It's a gene that tells the red blood cell — the bone marrow cells that produce red cells — to stop making fetal hemoglobin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This CRISPR treatment starts with doctors extracting bone marrow cells from patients' blood. Company scientists then use CRISPR to edit a gene in the cells to make the cells produce fetal hemoglobin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That will help the cells make more fetal hemoglobin and make them happier and healthier,&quot; Frangoul says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Meredith Rizzo/NPR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients then undergo the same kind of grueling chemotherapy administered as part of a standard bone marrow transplant. That wipes out the existing cells that are carrying the genetic defect. But instead of receiving new cells from a donor, the patients get billions of their own cells that have been edited with CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that it will provide a treatment option for all patients, including those who can't find a matched donor. The approach hopefully will be safer because the cells come from patients' own bone marrow. So they shouldn't attack patients' bodies, Frangoul says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This opens the door for many patients to potentially be treated and to have their disease modified to be mild&quot; and to avoid the &quot;horrible, horrible long-term side effects of sickle cell disease,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Gray, the process was sometimes long and demanding. It required repeated trips from her home to Nashville for some lengthy stays in the hospital. The chemotherapy was especially rough, leaving her with mouth and throat sores that made it difficult to eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was really hard and painful for me,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Gray was surprised by the discomfort she felt at the moment earlier this month when Frangoul pushed the plunger on a large syringe to infuse more than 2 billion of the edited cells into her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a little scary, tough moment for me,&quot; she says. &quot;But after that, I cried. But it was happy tears.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was thrilled to finally have what she calls her &quot;supercells&quot; inside her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's what all of this is about — the edited cells. It's the supercells that's what's going to make the difference between me having the sickle cell pain crises and not having them,&quot; Gray says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hopes it works and imagines a life without sickle cell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Being able to wake up and not be in pain. And to just be tired because I've done something — and not just tired for no reason. And just to be outside, and jump on the trampoline with my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And go to graduations and weddings. And see them grow up. That means the world to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Has Removed a Mapping App That Let Protesters in Hong Kong Track Police</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/apple-hkmaplive-hong-kong-police-china</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/apple-hkmaplive-hong-kong-police-china</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;61&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple removed from its App Store on Wednesday a popular crowdsourced mapping app called HKmap.live, which let people in Hong Kong track police during the country’s ongoing pro-democracy protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal has sparked outrage from critics who have accused the company of kowtowing to the Chinese government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple removed the app days after the company was criticized in Chinese state media for aiding “rioters” in Hong Kong. An editorial in People’s Daily, a government-run newspaper, said: “Letting poisonous software have its ways is a betrayal of Chinese people’s feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement late on Wednesday, Apple said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong. Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it. The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau [CSTCB] that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the developers of HKmap.live tweeted that there was “0 evidence to support CSTCB’s accusation” and added that “HKmap App never solicits, promotes, or encourages criminal activity. HKmap App consolidates information from user and public sources, e.g. live news stream, Facebook and Telegram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;54.950342465753&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is Apple’s second-most important market after the United States. The company generated $52 billion — a fifth of its sales — from Chinese customers in the last year alone, and it also manufactures most of its products in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, Apple has responded to Chinese pressure. It has &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-pulls-new-york-times-app-from-china-store-1483576379?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deleted&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of apps from its App Store in China, including the New York Times in 2017, for violating local regulations. This week, the company &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://qz.com/1723334/apple-removes-taiwan-flag-emoji-in-hong-kong-macau-in-ios-13-1-1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the Taiwan flag emoji for users in Hong Kong who updated to its latest iPhone operating system, iOS 13, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20907228/apple-quartz-app-store-china-removal-hong-kong-protests-censorship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the app of news outlet Quartz from the Chinese App Store over Quartz’s coverage of the Hong Kong protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s government has put pressure on American companies in the last few weeks for supporting the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, which Chinese authorities say are a separatist movement that threatens the stability of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, China’s state broadcaster CCTV and other Chinese partners said they would stop cooperation with the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/hong-kong-nba-fans-signs-protests&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NBA's Houston Rockets&lt;/a&gt; after the team’s general manager Daryl Morey supported the Hong Kong protests in a tweet, which he since deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance discovery, made by Diego K. Kersting from the Freie University of Berlin and the University of Barcelona during diving expeditions in the Spanish Mediterranean, was reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kersting and co-author Cristina Linares have been carrying out long-term monitoring of 243 colonies of the endangered reef-builder coral Cladocora caespitosa since 2002, allowing them to describe in previous papers recurring warming-related mass mortalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At some point, we saw living polyps in these colonies, which we thought were completely dead,&quot; Kersting told AFP, adding it was a &quot;big surprise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coral are made up of hundreds to thousands of tiny creatures called polyps that secrete a hard outer skeleton of calcium carbonate (limestone) and attach themselves to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/ocean+floor/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;ocean floor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat waves kill these animals—by either essentially roasting them alive or causing them to eject the symbiotic algae that live within them and provide them nutrients, thus leading to coral bleaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter of the coral cover of Spain's Columbretes Islands was lost to a particularly extreme heat wave in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time running out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researchers found that in 38 percent of the impacted colonies, the polyps had devised a survival strategy: shrinking their dimensions, partly abandoning their original skeleton, and gradually, over a period of several years, growing back and starting a new skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were then able to gradually re-colonize dead areas through budding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be sure the polyps were in fact the same animals staging a comeback, rather than new coral created through sexual reproduction, the team used 3D computer imaging to confirm the old, abandoned skeleton was connected to the new structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of &quot;rejuvenescence&quot; was known to exist in the fossil record but had never before been observed in coral colonies that exist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kersting said the finding opens up the intriguing possibility that other modern corals around the world—such as those in Australia's dying Great Barrier Reef—might be applying similar survival strategies, though further investigation is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also meant that there was a narrow window of opportunity to prevent coral reefs, vital ecosystem engineers that provide shelter for hundreds of species of fish and plants, from going extinct as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;For sure, it's good news, but what we are seeing now in the Mediterranean Sea and other parts of the world is that these marine heat waves are recurrent—happening every summer or every second summer,&quot; Kersting said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These corals also grow very slowly—at a rate of about 3 millimeters a year—&quot;so if you are having every second summer a heat wave, and it's killing 10 to 15 percent of the cover, I mean, the numbers are clear,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They actually need help from us. We need to stop &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot; class=&quot;textTag&quot;&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;, because it's not going to be enough.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
