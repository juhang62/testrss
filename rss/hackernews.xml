<title>H.264 Is Magic (2016)</title>
<link>https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a video compression codec standard. It is ubiquitous - internet video, Blu-ray, phones, security cameras, drones, everything. Everything uses H.264 now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a remarkable piece of technology. It is the result of 30+ years of work with one single goal: To reduce the bandwidth required for transmission of full-motion video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, it is very interesting. This post will give insight into some of the details at a high level - I hope to not bore you too much with the intricacies. Also note that many of the concepts explained here apply to video compression in general, and not just H.264.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why even compress anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple uncompressed video file will contain an array of 2D buffers containing pixel data for each frame. So it's a 3D (2 spatial dimensions and 1 temporal) array of bytes. Each pixel takes 3 bytes to store - one byte each for the three primary colors (red, green and blue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1080p @ 60 Hz = 1920x1080x60x3 =&amp;gt; ~&lt;strong&gt;370 MB/sec&lt;/strong&gt; of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is next to impossible to deal with. A 50GB Blu-ray disk will only hold ~2 mins. You can't move it anywhere fast. Even SSDs have trouble dumping this straight from RAM to Disk&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. We need compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;H.264&lt;/em&gt; compression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I will answer this. But first let me show you something. Here is the Apple Homepage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/HomePage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I captured the screen of this home page and produced two files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eh. What? Those file sizes look switched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they're right. The H.264 video, 300 frames long is 175KB. A single frame of that video in PNG is 1015KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like we're storing 300 times the amount of data in the video. But the file size is a fifth. So H.264 would seem to be 1500x as efficient as PNG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this even possible? All right, what's the trick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very many tricks! H.264 uses all the tricks you can think of (and tons you can't think of). Let's go through the important ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;sheddingweight&quot;&gt;Shedding weight&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're building a car for street racing. You need to go faster. What is the first thing you do? You shed some weight. Your car weighs 3000 lbs. You throw away stuff you don't need. Those back seats? pfft. Chuck those. That subwoofer? Gone. No music for you. Air Conditioning? Yeah, ditch it. Transmission? Ye..no. Wait! We're gonna need that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You remove everything except the things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept of throwing away bits you don't need to save space is called &lt;strong&gt;lossy&lt;/strong&gt; compression. H.264 is a lossy codec - it throws away less important bits and only keeps the important bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PNG is a &lt;strong&gt;lossless&lt;/strong&gt; codec. It means that nothing is thrown away. Bit for bit, the original source image can be recovered from a PNG encoded image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important bits? How does the algorithm know what bits in my frame are important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few obvious ways to trim out images. Maybe the top right quadrant is useless all the time. So maybe we can zero out those pixels and discard that quadrant. We would use only 3/4th of the space we need. ~2200 lbs now. Or maybe we can crop out a thick border around the edges of the frame, the important stuff is in the middle anyway. Yes, you could do these. But H.264 doesn't do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does H.264 actually do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.264, like other lossy image algorithms, discards detail information. Here is a close-up of the original compared with the image post-discard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/CompressedImage-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how the compressed one does not show the holes in the speaker grills in the MacBook Pro? If you don't zoom in, you would even notice the difference. The image on the right weighs in at &lt;strong&gt;7%&lt;/strong&gt; the size of the original - and we haven't even compressed the image in the traditional sense. Imagine your car weighed just 200 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7% wow! How do you discard detail information like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this we need a quick math lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;informationentropy&quot;&gt;Information Entropy&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're getting to the juicy bits! Ha puns! If you took an information theory class, you might remember information entropy. Information entropy is the number of bits required to represent some information. Note that it is not simply the size of some dataset. It is minimum number of bits that must be used to represent all the information contained in a dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if your dataset is the result of a single coin toss, you need 1 bit of entropy. If you have record two coin tosses, you'll need 2 bits. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have some strange coin - you've tossed it 10 times, and every time it lands on heads. How would you describe this information to someone? You wouldn't say HHHHHHHHH. You would just say &quot;10 tosses, all heads&quot; - bam! You've just compressed some data! Easy. I saved you hours of mindfuck lectures. This is obviously an oversimplification, but you've transformed some data into another shorter representation of the same information. You've reduced data &lt;strong&gt;redundancy&lt;/strong&gt;. The information entropy in this dataset has not changed - you've just converted between representations. This type of encoder is called an &lt;strong&gt;entropy encoder&lt;/strong&gt; - it's a general-purpose lossless encoder that works for any type of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;frequencydomain&quot;&gt;Frequency Domain&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand information entropy, let's move on to transformations of data. You can represent data in some fundamental units. If you use binary, you have 0 and 1. If you use hex, you have 16 characters. You can easily transform between the two systems. They are essentially equivalent. So far so good? Ok!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some imagination! Imagine you can transform any dataset that varies over space(or time) - something like the brightness value of an image, into a different coordinate space. So instead of x-y coordinates, let's say we have frequency coordinates. freqX and freqY are the axes now. This is called a &lt;strong&gt;frequency domain&lt;/strong&gt; representation. There is another mindfuck mathematical theorem&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that states that you can do this for any data and you can achieve a perfect lossless transformation as long as freqX and freqY are high enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, but what the freq are freqX and freqY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freqX and freqY are some other set of basis units. Just like when we switch from binary to hex, we have a different fundamental unit, we're switching from the familiar X-Y to freqX and freqY. Hex 'A' looks different from binary '1010'. Both mean the same thing, but &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; different. So here is what our image looks like in the frequency domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/BasicFFT-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine grill on that MacBook pro has a high information content in the higher frequency components of that image. Finely varying content = high frequency components. Any sort of gradual variation in the color and brightness - such as gradients are low frequency components of that image. Anything in between falls in between. So fine details = high freq. Gentle gradients = low freq. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the frequency domain representation, the low frequency components are near the center of that image. The higher frequency components are towards of the edges of the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Kinda makes sense. But why do all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because now, you can take that frequency domain image and then mask out the edges - discard information which will contain the information with high frequency components. Now if you convert back to your regular x-y coordinates, you'll find that the resulting image looks similar to the original but has lost some of the fine details. But now, the image only occupies a fraction of the space. By controlling how big your mask is, you can now tune precisely how detailed you want your output images to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the close-up of the laptop in the home page again. Except now, there is a circular border mask that's been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sidbala.com/content/images/2016/11/QuantizationHorizontalWithMasks-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers represent the information entropy of that image as a fraction of the original. Even at 2%, you won't notice the difference unless you're at this zoom level. 2%! - your car now weighs 60 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's how you shed weight. This process in lossy compression is called &lt;strong&gt;quantization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Impressive, I guess. What else you got?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;chromasubsampling&quot;&gt;Chroma Subsampling.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human/eye brain system is not very good at resolving finer details in color. It can detect minor variations in brightness very easily but not color. So there must be some way to discard color information to shed even more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a TV signal, R+G+B color data gets transformed to Y+Cb+Cr. The Y is the luminance (essentially black and white brightness) and the Cb and Cr are the chrominance (color) components. RGB and YCbCr are equivalent in terms of information entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why unnecessarily complicate? RGB not good enough for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back before we had color TV, we only had the Y signal. And when color TVs just started coming along, engineers had to figure out a way to transmit RGB color along with Y. Instead of using two separate data streams, they wisely decided to encode the color information into Cb and Cr and transmit that along with the Y information. That way, BW TVs would only look at the Y component. Color TVs will, in addition, look at the chrominance components and convert to RGB internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But check out the trick: the Y component gets encoded at full resolution. The C components only at a quarter resolution. Since the eye/brain is terrible at detecting color variations, you can get away with this. By doing this, you reduce total bandwidth by one half, with very little visual difference. Half! Your car now weighs 30 lbs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of discarding some of the color information is called &lt;strong&gt;Chroma Subsampling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/#fn:4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While not specific to H.264 and has been around for decades itself, it is used almost universally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the big weight shedders for lossy compression. Our frames are now tiny - since we discarded most of the detail information and half of the color information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. That's it? Can we do something more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Weight shedding is only the first step. So far we're only looking at the spatial domains within a single frame. Now it's time to explore temporal compression - where we look at a group of frames across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;motioncompensation&quot;&gt;Motion compensation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H.264 is a motion compensation compression standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motion compensation? What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're watching a tennis match. The camera is fixed at a certain angle. The only thing moving is the ball back and forth. How would you encode this information? You do what you always do, right? You have a 3D array of pixels, two dimensions in space and one in time. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah. Why would you? Most of the image is the same anyway. The court, the net, the crowds, all are static. The only real action is the ball moving. What if you could just have one static image of everything in the background, and then one moving image of just the ball? Wouldn't that save a lot of space? You see where I am going with this? Get it? See where I am going? Motion estimation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lame jokes aside, this is exactly what H.264 does. H.264 splits up the image into macro-blocks - typically 16x16 pixel blocks that it will use for motion estimation. It encodes one static image - typically called an &lt;strong&gt;I-frame&lt;/strong&gt;(Intra frame). This is a full frame - containing all the bits it required to construct that frame. And then subsequent frames are either &lt;strong&gt;P-frames&lt;/strong&gt;(predicted) or &lt;strong&gt;B-frames&lt;/strong&gt;(bi-directionally predicted). P-frames are frames that will encode a motion vector for each of the macro-blocks from the previous frame. So a P-frame has to be constructed by the decoder based on previous frames. It starts with the last I-frame in the video stream and then walks through every subsequent frame - adding up the motion vector deltas as it goes along until it arrives at the current frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B-frames are even more interesting, where the prediction happens bi-directionally, both from past frames and from future frames. So you can imagine now why that Apple home page video is so well compressed. Because it's really just three I-frames in which the macro blocks are being panned around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you've been playing a video on YouTube. You missed the last few seconds of dialog, so you scrub back a few seconds. Have you noticed that it doesn't instantly start playing from that timecode you just selected. It pauses for a few moments and then plays. It's already buffered those frames from the network, since you just played it, so why that pause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah that annoys the shit out of me. Why does it do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you've asked the decoder to jump to some arbitrary frame, the decoder has to redo all the calculations - starting from the nearest I-frames and adding up the motion vector deltas to the frame you're on - and this is computationally expensive, and hence the brief pause. Hopefully you'll be less annoyed now, knowing it's actually doing hard work and not just sitting around just to annoy you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you're only encoding motion vectors deltas, this technique is extremely space-efficient for any video with motion, at the cost of some computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we've covered both spatial and temporal compression! So far we have a shitton of space saved in Quantization. Chroma subsampling further halved the space required. On top of that, we have motion compensation that stores only 3 actual frames for the ~300 that we had in that video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty good to me. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we wrap up and seal the deal. We use a traditional lossless entropy encoder. Because why not? Let's just slap that on there for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;entropycoder&quot;&gt;Entropy Coder&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The I-frames, after the lossy steps, contain redundant information. The motion vectors for each of the macro blocks in the P and B-frames - there are entire groups of them with the same values - since several macro blocks move by the same amount when the image pans in our test video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entropy encoder will take care of this redundancy. And since it is a general purpose lossless encoder, we don't have to worry about what tradeoffs it's making. We can recover all the data that goes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we're done! At the core of it, this is how video compression codecs like H.264 work. These are its tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok great! But I am curious to know how much our car weighs now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original video was captured at an odd resolution of 1232x1154. If we apply the math here, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 secs @ 60 fps = 1232x1154x60x3x5 =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;1.2 GB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compressed video =&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;175 KB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we apply the same ratio to our 3000 lb car, we get &lt;strong&gt;0.4 lbs&lt;/strong&gt; as the final weight. 6.5 ounces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. It's magic!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I am massively oversimplifying several decades of intense research in this field. If you want to know more, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Page&lt;/a&gt; is pretty descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/05/firefox-brings-you-smooth-video-playback-with-the-worlds-fastest-av1-decoder/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/05/21/latest-firefox-release-is-faster-than-ever/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;release of Firefox 67&lt;/a&gt; brought a number of performance enhancing features that make this our fastest browser ever.  Among these is the high performance, royalty free AV1 video decoder &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;dav1d&lt;/a&gt;, now enabled by default on all desktop platforms (Windows, OSX and Linux) for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With files more than 30% smaller than today’s most popular web codec VP9 [1], and nearly 50% smaller than its widely deployed predecessor H.264 [2], AV1 allows high-quality video experiences with a lot less network usage, and has the potential to transform how and where we watch video on the Internet. However, because AV1 is brand new and more sophisticated, some experts had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multichannel.com/news/hardware-support-big-step-ahead-av1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that market adoption would wait until 2020 when high-performance hardware decoders are expected.  Dav1d in the browser upends these predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aomedia.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alliance for Open Media&lt;/a&gt;, dav1d is a joint effort between the French non-profit VideoLAN and the greater FFmpeg open source audio/video community.  Some of the leading minds in open source multimedia joined forces to release the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2018/First-release-of-dav1d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; version of dav1d last fall, already 2x to 5x faster than &lt;a href=&quot;https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/&quot;&gt;libaom&lt;/a&gt;, the reference decoder published by AOMedia as part of the AV1 standards effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33514&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-500x267.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;970&quot; height=&quot;518&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-500x267.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-250x134.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-v-aomdec-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then the dav1d developers have squeezed out even more performance by profiling and rewriting critical sections in highly-parallelized SIMD assembly. And this shows in the benchmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33521&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-500x268.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;694&quot; height=&quot;372&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-500x268.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-250x134.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/dav1d-SIMD-1-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher performance and greater efficiency means smooth playback of AV1 video in the browser with significantly less CPU utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AV1 already seeing adoption on the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing dav1d in Firefox could not have happened at a better time.  In just the past few months we’ve seen remarkable growth in the use of AV1, with our latest figures showing that 11.8% of video playback in Firefox Beta used AV1, up from 3% in March and 0.85% in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-33518&quot; src=&quot;https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-500x310.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;987&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; srcset=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-500x310.png 500w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-250x155.png 250w, https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2019/05/firefox-av1-proportion-2-768x476.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that desktop Firefox contains dav1d, we expect even more websites will take advantage of this next-generation, royalty-free video codec AV1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mozilla investing in the AV1 future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art decoders like dav1d are great for video playback, but best-in-class, free and open source software &lt;em&gt;en&lt;/em&gt;coders are equally important to a healthy AV1 community.  The AOMedia reference encoder was developed with the goal of creating the AV1 standard, not a production encoder.  Thus, Mozilla and Xiph.Org are jointly developing a clean-room encoder named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xiph/rav1e&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rav1e&lt;/a&gt; (the Rust AV1 Encoder) to increase encoding gains over the reference encoder and allow software encoding fast enough for real-time applications like WebRTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good encoders make heavy use of psychovisual models to allocate bits for what humans perceive as good visual quality (not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;PSNR&lt;/a&gt;).  With rav1e we are applying the perceptual analysis expertise from our earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.xiph.org/index.php?title=Daala&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Daala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Theora&lt;/a&gt; codec development efforts to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~jm/daala/pvq_demo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;activity masking&lt;/a&gt;, better &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/barrbrain/9d541d809d1d664460b5ce5c00a57948/Chroma%20quantizer%20balance.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;color balancing&lt;/a&gt;, improved &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/theora/demo8.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rate control&lt;/a&gt; and perceptual distortion metrics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/av1/demo2.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;CDEF&lt;/a&gt; that bring new, improved quality to AV1 encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also investing considerable research to improve encoder speed, optimizing new techniques that appear for the first time in AV1.  It’s not enough to rewrite existing code from the initial reference encoder in SIMD assembly and make it four times faster. Rav1e is developing ways to make AV1 encoding tools 1000x faster by finding new algorithms rather than simply optimizing existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rav1e is getting better all the time.  Active development continues at a rapid pace, landing major new improvements weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join the conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once-per-game feedback requests or release threads are OK, but a considerable history of participation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev&quot;&gt;/r/gamedev&lt;/a&gt; is required. Must be a Text Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devlogs&lt;/strong&gt; that do not have a focus on being useful to other developers. Do not talk about what advancements occurred on your game this week. That is what Feedback Friday, Screenshot Saturday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/devblogs&quot;&gt;/r/devblogs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedevscreens&quot;&gt;/r/gamedevscreens&lt;/a&gt; are for.&lt;/p&gt;

The focus should be on providing info to the community, not promoting yourself. Be sure to include your education and years of experience to provide some context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not use [tags]&lt;/strong&gt;, assign flair to your post after it's created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question posts...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;should include what you've already tried and why it was inadequate. Be sure to check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/wiki/faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Announcing Rust 1.35.0</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/05/23/Rust-1.35.0.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/05/23/Rust-1.35.0.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.35.0. Rust is a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.35.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot;&gt;$ rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1350-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.35.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in 1.35.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of this release is the implementation of the &lt;code&gt;FnOnce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FnMut&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; closure traits for &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnMut&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Additionally, closures may now be coerced to unsafe function pointers. The &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; macro introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/01/17/Rust-1.32.0.html#the-dbg-macro&quot;&gt;Rust 1.32.0&lt;/a&gt; can now also be called without arguments. Moreover, there were a number of standard library stabilizations. Read on for a few highlights, or see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1350-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fn*&lt;/code&gt; closure traits implemented for &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn*&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.35.0, the &lt;code&gt;FnOnce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FnMut&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; traits &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55431&quot;&gt;are now implemented&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnMut&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, if you wanted to call the function stored in a boxed closure, you had to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.34.0/std/boxed/trait.FnBox.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FnBox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This was because instances of &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and friends did not implement the respective &lt;code&gt;Fn*&lt;/code&gt; traits. This also meant that it was not possible to pass boxed functions to code expecting an implementor of a &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; trait, and you had to create temporary closures to pass them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was ultimately due to a limitation in the compiler's ability to reason about such implementations, which has since been fixed with the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/unsized-locals.html&quot;&gt;unsized locals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release, you can now use boxed functions in places that expect items implementing a function trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code now works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn foo(x: Box&amp;lt;dyn Fn(u8) -&amp;gt; u8&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt; {
    vec![1, 2, 3, 4].into_iter().map(x).collect()
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, you can now directly call &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn foo(x: Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce()&amp;gt;) {
    x()
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coercing closures to &lt;code&gt;unsafe fn&lt;/code&gt; pointers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/07/20/Rust-1.19.html&quot;&gt;Rust 1.19.0&lt;/a&gt;, it has been possible to coerce closures that do not capture from their environment into function pointers. For example, you may write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn twice(x: u8, f: fn(u8) -&amp;gt; u8) -&amp;gt; u8 {
    f(f(x))
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(42, twice(0, |x| x + 21));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has however not extended to &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; function pointers. With this release of Rust, you may now do so. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;/// The safety invariants are those of the `unsafe fn` pointer passed.
unsafe fn call_unsafe_fn_ptr(f: unsafe fn()) {
    f()
}

fn main() {
    // SAFETY: There are no invariants.
    // The closure is statically prevented from doing unsafe things.
    unsafe {
        call_unsafe_fn_ptr(|| {
            dbg!();
        });
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calling &lt;code&gt;dbg!()&lt;/code&gt; with no argument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of all the occasional and frequent &quot;print debuggers&quot; out there, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/01/17/Rust-1.32.0.html#the-dbg-macro&quot;&gt;Rust 1.32.0&lt;/a&gt; saw the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; macro&lt;/a&gt;. To recap, the macro allows you to quickly inspect the value of some expression with context. For example, when running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    let mut x = 0;

    if dbg!(x == 1) {
        x += 1;
    }

    dbg!(x);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...you would see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[src/main.rs:4] x == 1 = false
[src/main.rs:8] x = 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen in the previous section, where the higher order function &lt;code&gt;call_unsafe_fn_ptr&lt;/code&gt; is called, you may now also call &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; without passing any arguments. This is useful when tracing what branches your application takes. For example, with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    if condition {
        dbg!();
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...you would see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[src/main.rs:5]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Library stabilizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1.35.0, a number of APIs have become stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, some implementations were added and other changes occured as well. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1350-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Copy the sign of a floating point number onto another&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release, new methods &lt;code&gt;copysign&lt;/code&gt; have been added to the floating point primitive types &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f32&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, you can use these to copy the sign of one number onto another. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    assert_eq!(3.5_f32.copysign(-0.42), -3.5);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Check whether a &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;contains&lt;/code&gt; a value&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust 1.35.0 contains a few freshly minted methods on the &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these, you can easily check whether a given value exists in a range. For example, you may write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    if (0..=10).contains(&amp;amp;5) {
        println!(&quot;Five is included in zero to ten.&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Map and split a borrowed &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt; value in two&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Rust 1.35.0, you can now map and split the borrowed value of a &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt; into multiple borrows for different components of the borrowed data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Replace the value of a &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt; through a closure&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release introduces a convenience method &lt;code&gt;replace_with&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;RefCell&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With it, you can more ergonomically map and replace the current value of the cell and get back the old value as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hash a pointer or reference by address, not value&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this release, we have introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function takes a raw pointer and hashes it. Using &lt;code&gt;ptr::hash&lt;/code&gt;, you can avoid hashing the pointed-to value of a reference and instead hash the address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Copy the contents of an &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;&amp;amp;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning with Rust 1.0.0, the methods &lt;code&gt;Option::cloned&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;&amp;amp;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Option&amp;lt;&amp;amp;mut T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; have allowed you to clone the contents in case of &lt;code&gt;Some(_)&lt;/code&gt;. However, cloning can sometimes be an expensive operation and the methods &lt;code&gt;opt.cloned()&lt;/code&gt; provided no hints to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release of Rust, we introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionality of &lt;code&gt;opt.copied()&lt;/code&gt; is the same as for &lt;code&gt;opt.cloned()&lt;/code&gt;. However, calling the method requires that &lt;code&gt;T: Copy&lt;/code&gt;. Using this method, you can make sure that code stops compiling should &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; no longer implements &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changes in Clippy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this release of Rust, Clippy (a collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code) added a new lint &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#drop_bounds&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop_bounds&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This lint triggers when you add a bound &lt;code&gt;T: Drop&lt;/code&gt; to a generic function. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn foo&amp;lt;T: Drop&amp;gt;(x: T) {}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a bound &lt;code&gt;T: Drop&lt;/code&gt; is almost always a mistake as it excludes types, such as &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt;, which have trivial drop-glues. Moreover, &lt;code&gt;T: Drop&lt;/code&gt; does not account for types like &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; not having interesting destructor behavior directly but rather as a result of embedding types, such as &lt;code&gt;Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, that do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#drop_bounds&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop_bounds&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this release of Clippy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/4101&quot;&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; the lint&lt;code&gt;redundant_closure&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;redundant_closure&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redundant_closure_for_method_calls&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#rust-135-beta&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for Clippy&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changes in Cargo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#cargo-135-2019-05-23&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for Cargo&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributors to 1.35.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.35.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.35.0/&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Assange Indicted Under Espionage Act, Raising First Amendment Issues</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON — Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks leader, has been indicted on 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for his role in obtaining and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents in 2010, the Justice Department announced on Thursday — a novel case that raises profound First Amendment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1037-julian-assange-espionage-act-indictment/426b4e534ab60553ba6c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new charges&lt;/a&gt; were part of an expanded indictment obtained by the Trump administration that significantly raised the stakes of the legal case against Mr. Assange, who is already fighting extradition proceedings in London based on &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/europe/julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuador-embassy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;an earlier hacking-related count&lt;/a&gt; brought by federal prosecutors in Northern Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The charges are the latest twist in a career in which Mr. Assange has morphed from a crusader for radical transparency to fugitive from a Swedish sexual assault investigation, to tool of Russia’s election interference, to criminal defendant in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Assange vaulted to global fame nearly a decade ago as a champion of openness about what government secrets do. But with this indictment, he has become the target for a case that could open the door to criminalizing activities that are crucial to American investigative journalists who write about national security matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The case has nothing to do with Russia’s election interference in 2016, when Mr. Assange’s organization published Democratic emails stolen by Russia as part of its covert efforts to help elect President Trump. Instead, it focuses on Mr. Assange’s role in the leak of hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and military files by the former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Justice Department officials did not explain why they decided to charge Mr. Assange under the Espionage Act — a step also debated within the Obama administration but ultimately not taken. Although the indictment could establish a precedent that deems actions related to obtaining, and in some cases publishing, state secrets to be criminal, the officials sought to minimize the implications for press freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/politics/assange-indictment.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Press freedoms and the case against Julian Assange, explained.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They noted that most of the new charges were related to obtaining the secret document archives, as opposed to publishing them. In the counts that deemed the publication of the files a crime, prosecutors focused on a handful of documents revealing the names of people who provided information to the United States in dangerous places like war zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Some say that Assange is a journalist and that he should be immune from prosecution for these actions,” John Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said at a briefing with reporters. “The department takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy and we thank you for it. It is not and has never been the department’s policy to target them for reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Assange, he said, was “no journalist.” Mr. Demers accused him of conspiring with Ms. Manning to obtain classified information. “No responsible actor, journalist or otherwise, would purposefully publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in a war zone, exposing them to the gravest of dangers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For the purposes of press freedoms, what matters is not who counts as a journalist, but whether journalistic activities — whether performed by a “journalist” or anyone else — can be crimes in America. The Trump administration’s move could establish a precedent used to criminalize future acts of national-security journalism, said Jameel Jaffer of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The charges rely almost entirely on conduct that investigative journalists engage in every day,” he said. “The indictment should be understood as a frontal attack on press freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Demers left the press briefing without taking questions. And a Justice Department official who stayed behind to answer questions on the condition that he would not be named would not address any about how most of the basic actions the indictment deemed felonies by Mr. Assange differed in a legally meaningful way from ordinary national-security investigative journalism — encouraging sources to provide secret information of news value, obtaining it without the government’s permission and then publishing portions of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Notably, The New York Times, among many other news organizations, obtained precisely the same archives of documents from WikiLeaks, without authorization from the government — the act that most of the charges addressed. While The Times &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/26editors-note.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;did take steps to withhold the names of informants&lt;/a&gt; in the subset of the files it published, it is not clear how that is legally different from publishing other classified information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Barry J. Pollack, a lawyer for Mr. Assange, said his client was being charged with a crime “for encouraging sources to provide him truthful information and for publishing that information.” That dramatic step, he said, removed the “fig leaf” that the case about his client was only about hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-bsn42l&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Over the years, the WikiLeaks founder has been embraced by everyone from Lady Gaga to Sean Hannity. But he’s also made enemies along the way. Our video shows how his anti-secrecy agenda has attracted, and repelled, people across the political spectrum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-cch8ym&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1dv1kvn&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;emkp2hg2 css-1nwzsjy e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andrew Testa for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These unprecedented charges demonstrate the gravity of the threat the criminal prosecution of Julian Assange poses to all journalists in their endeavor to inform the public about actions that have been taken by the U.S. government,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For most of American history, it was rare for the government to treat the leaking of its secrets to the news media as a crime. But starting in the second half of the George W. Bush administration and accelerating during the Obama administration, the Justice Department began making much more routine use of the Espionage Act to go after officials who provided information to the public through reporters, as opposed to actual spies. The World War I-era law criminalizes the disclosure of potentially damaging national security secrets to someone not authorized to receive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;On its face, the Espionage Act could also be used to prosecute reporters who publish government secrets. But many legal scholars believe that prosecuting people for acts related to receiving and publishing information would violate the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That notion has never been tested in court, however, because until now the government has never brought such charges. The closest it came was indicting two lobbyists for a pro-Israel group in 2005 who received classified information about American policy toward Iran and passed it on. But that case fell apart after several skeptical pretrial rulings by a judge, and the charges were dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though he is not a conventional journalist, much of what Mr. Assange does at WikiLeaks is difficult to distinguish in a legally meaningful way from what traditional news organizations like The Times do: seek and publish information that officials want to be secret, including classified national security matters, and take steps to protect the confidentiality of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Obama administration had also weighed charging Mr. Assange, but rejected that step out of fears that it would chill investigative journalism and could be struck down as unconstitutional. A Justice Department official declined to address whether there was any new evidence that had come to light recently or whether the Trump administration had simply decided to take a step the Obama administration had shied away from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The three charges that squarely addressed Mr. Assange’s publication of government secrets were focused on a handful of files that contained the names of people who had provided information to the United States in dangerous places like the Afghanistan and Iraq war zones, and authoritarian states like China, Iran and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The evidence laid out in the indictment against Mr. Assange mapped onto information presented by military prosecutors in the 2013 court-martial trial of Ms. Manning. Prosecutors in her case also alleged that her actions endangered the people whose names were revealed in the documents when Mr. Assange published them, though they presented no evidence that anyone was killed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A Justice Department official declined to say whether any such evidence now exists, but stressed that prosecutors would need to prove in court only what they say in the indictment: that publication put people in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison — by far the longest punishment for a leak case in American history. But in one of his last acts in office, President Barack Obama commuted most of the remainder of her sentence in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She is now back in jail again, after a judge held her in contempt for refusing to testify about her interactions with Mr. Assange before the grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia that indicted him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Manning’s disclosure via WikiLeaks was one of the most extraordinary leaks in American history — the bulk disclosure of hundreds of thousands of State Department cables that revealed many secret things about the world, dossiers about Guantánamo Bay detainees being held without trial, and logs of significant events in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars that divulged, among other things, that civilian casualties were far higher than official estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When Ms. Manning’s disclosures initially vaulted Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks to global fame, he was seen as a villain by the Obama administration and the permanent bureaucracy of law-enforcement and national-security officials, but treated as an icon by transparency and antiwar activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His image later transformed significantly when WikiLeaks published archives of Democratic emails that had been stolen and provided to him by the Russian government as part of its covert efforts to help Mr. Trump win the 2016 election. But the legal case against Mr. Assange has nothing to do with those subsequent events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Assange was indicted in March 2018 in federal court in Alexandria, Va., on a charge of conspiring to commit unlawful computer intrusion. Prosecutors accused Mr. Assange of agreeing to help Ms. Manning crack an encoded portion of a passcode that would have enabled her to log on to a classified military network under a different user name than her own, which would have masked her tracks better. That came after she had already started sending files, and they have not alleged that his efforts succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That charge was unveiled in April, when Mr. Assange was arrested in London after being dragged out of the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he had lived for years to avoid capture. The United States has asked Britain to extradite Mr. Assange, who is fighting the move, and the filing of the new charges clears the way for British courts to weigh whether it would be lawful to transfer custody of him to a place where he will face Espionage Act charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago exactly, someone began hacking Equifax. Today, it’s starting to feel some pain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breach was made possible by a software vulnerability that was already known and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/oh-man-youre-gonna-hate-what-equifax-just-admitted-abo-1809064565&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/oh-man-youre-gonna-hate-what-equifax-just-admitted-abo-1809064565', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;fixable for months&lt;/a&gt;. The intrusion into Equifax’s network began in May 2017 but wasn’t discovered until July. The credit reporting company failed catastrophically to spot the data flowing out of its coffers. By the time anyone noticed, the information of about 150 million people was compromised, though it would take them several months to realize the full tally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress has called the entire incident “&lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;entirely preventable&lt;/a&gt;” and one congressman called Equifax executives “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberscoop.com/consumer-protection-subcommittee-rails-equifax-seeks-answers-retired-ceo/?category_news=news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cyberscoop.com/consumer-protection-subcommittee-rails-equifax-seeks-answers-retired-ceo/?category_news=news', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt;.” Outside of Capitol Hill, the conversation was a lot less polite. Two years on, no one knows who stole that mountain of sensitive data or what they’ve done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is taking notice of the consequences. This week, the financial rating service Moody’s downgraded Equifax from a “stable” to a “negative” outlook due to the high level of cybersecurity spending and litigation that comes as a direct result of the 2017 breach. It’s the first time cybersecurity was cited as the reason for an outlook change, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/moodys-downgrades-equifax-outlook-to-negative-cites-cybersecurity.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/moodys-downgrades-equifax-outlook-to-negative-cites-cybersecurity.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers add up to a fortune, even for a massive corporation like Equifax. Lawsuits and investigations have cost $690 million in the first quarter of 2019 alone, which Moody’s cited as one of the reasons for its outlook downgrade. Moody’s expects $400 million more spent in each of the next two years and then a $250 million bill in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash Equifax will have to spend in relation to the cyberattack and bolstering its security are going to ding the company’s profits, according to Moodys, which explained in its report that, after next year, Equifax’s “infrastructure investments are likely to remain higher than they had been before the 2017 breach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the lawsuits will keep coming: In January, an Atlanta judge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/equifax-breach-lawsuit/equifax-must-face-lawsuits-over-massive-data-breach-ruling-idUSL1N1ZT255&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/equifax-breach-lawsuit/equifax-must-face-lawsuits-over-massive-data-breach-ruling-idUSL1N1ZT255', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; Equifax’s attempts to dismiss class-actions filed against the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax may be the first to have its outlook dinged as a result of a data breach but it is likely not the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The heightened emphasis on cybersecurity for all data oriented companies, which is especially acute for Equifax, leads us to expect that higher cybersecurity costs will continue to hurt the company’s profit and free cash flow for the foreseeable future,” Moody’s report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies are spending more on cybersecurity. Equifax, however, is playing catch up and paying a premium to do so—although anyone hoping for a solid legislative solution would say the cash price Equifax is now paying is not nearly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive home the point about Equifax’s spectacular blunder, here are the highlights from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448?_ga=2.143995702.2092165228.1558295709-2100675449.1537904885&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/equifax-breach-was-just-as-infuriating-and-dumb-as-you-1830996448?_ga=2.143995702.2092165228.1558295709-2100675449.1537904885', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;a 2018 congressional report&lt;/a&gt; on the incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entirely preventable.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax failed to fully appreciate and mitigate its cybersecurity risks. Had the company taken action to address its observable security issues, the data breach could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of accountability and management structure.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax failed to implement clear lines of authority within their internal IT management structure, leading to an execution gap between IT policy development and operation. Ultimately, the gap restricted the company’s ability to implement security initiatives in a comprehensive and timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex and outdated IT systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax’s aggressive growth strategy and accumulation of data resulted in a complex IT environment. Both the complexity and antiquated nature of Equifax’s custom-built legacy systems made IT security especially challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to implement responsible security measurements.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax allowed over 300 security certificates to expire, including 79 certificates for monitoring business critical domains. Failure to renew an expired digital certificate for 19 months left Equifax without visibility on the exfiltration of data during the time of the cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprepared to support affected consumers.&lt;/strong&gt; After Equifax informed the public of the data breach, they were unprepared to identify, alert and support affected consumers. The breach website and call centers were immediately overwhelmed, resulting in affected consumers being unable to access information necessary to protect their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cherry on top is the very nature of Equifax’s business. There is an entire industry on which Equifax sits near the top that tracks every bit of personal data they can find about you. Credit reporting companies know about your bank accounts, credit card, date of birth, Social Security number, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people make an informed decision to hand all that data over to companies like Equifax which explains the surprise of many Americans when they found out their data was likely involved in that 2017 breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are an American adult, the smart bet is that your data was stolen, too.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Notre Dame is unstable: a strong wind could make the walls collapse, report says</title>
<link>https://www.theartnewspaper.com/analysis/notre-dame-is-unstable</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;ap-content-advert-cont&quot; id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-mpu1-body&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ap-content-blocks&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-comp cb-item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-comp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-description-cont&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit-cont&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;An aerial photo of the damaged vaults of Notre Dame Cathedral&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Notre Dame is not stable and urgently needs reinforcing. That is the conclusion of an initial assessment of damage caused by the fire which destroyed its roof and spire on the night of 15 April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The collapse of a part of the vaults has severely reduced the safety of its structural system, which, in the case of a Gothic cathedral, does not rely on the heavy mass of the walls, as in classical architecture, but on discharging weight through clustered columns, external flying buttresses and counter-supports—a structural “exoskeleton” that until now has been extremely effective and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Paolo Vannucci, a mechanical engineer at the University of Versailles, has modelled the engineering of the structure and shown that the walls of Notre Dame could collapse under the pressure of wind speeds higher than 90km per hour, while before the fire they could withstand winds of up to 220km per hour, so they urgently need temporary supports. The stability of the vaults is also causing concern because the stone has been weakened by the fire and the weight of tons of water and the molten lead of the roof covering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Strengthening and restoring the structural system of Notre Dame must, therefore, be the primary goal in the rebuilding process, and it will certainly require more time than initially thought (President Macron announced the cathedral would be restored within five years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The walls need to be reinforced, and the rib vaults rebuilt and consolidated in order to allow the replacement of the roof, which itself plays an important structural role in the overall frame of the monument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;flèche&lt;/em&gt; (spire) erected by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in 1860, which collapsed in the fire, was structurally independent of the roof and walls, resting on the pillars of the crossing of nave and transept, but its weight also contributed to the stability of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-comp cb-item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mw-comp&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-description-cont&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit-cont&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;With a Gothic building, the vertical forces are discharged down the walls, while horizontal forces such as wind pressure are discharged through clustered columns, the external flying buttresses and counter-supports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The different elements of the cathedral thus form a unitary system, but the initial proposals have been for separate restoration of the main structure, the roof, and the damaged or lost decorative elements, and for the rebuilding of the spire. In fact, two days after the fire, President Macron invited architects around the world to propose ideas for a new one, as though it were an element independent of the rest of the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Whether the government now launches an architectural competition or decides to rely on the highly professional bodies in charge of French monuments (in particular, the Compagnie des Architects en Chef, to which Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of Notre Dame, belongs), it should demand an integrated project for the entire structure and not allow the design and implementation processes to be fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Notre Dame has Unesco World Heritage status, and this requires the conservation, restoration and reconstruction principles promoted by the World Heritage Convention, and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) Charters, to be taken into account. The architectural forms that have been lost should be reinstated, although this definitely does not preclude the use of modern techniques, materials, fire-prevention measures and advanced monitoring technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;On 10 May, the Assemblée nationale (parliament) adopted special legislation for the restoration and reconstruction of Notre Dame, which is expected to be passed in the senate on 27 May. This does not address technical issues, but creates a public agency in charge of managing procedures, which have been streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-comp cb-item&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Francesco Bandarin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;is an architect and former senior official at Unesco, director of its World Heritage Centre (2000-2010) and assistant director-general for culture (2010-2018).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>After 15 Years, the Pirate Bay Still Can’t Be Killed</title>
<link>https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/after-15-years-the-pirate-bay-still-cant-be-killed</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/after-15-years-the-pirate-bay-still-cant-be-killed</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a quiet corner of my high school’s study room in 2009, I booted up my busted laptop while making sure nobody could peer over my shoulder. I knew it was a risk to do this on a school Wi-Fi connection, but it sure felt safer than doing it at home. All it took was one website and a desktop app. The result was getting my hands on, well, pretty much any digital content I wanted, all for free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Little did I know that the site I was using, The Pirate Bay, was facing major legal turmoil at that time because of millions of users just like me. I also never expected that I’d still be using the same site, 10 years later, as if nothing ever changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The explosion of the internet in the early 2000s introduced me to many things: search engines, pornography, chat rooms, e-commerce. But nothing captured my attention quite like piracy, which seemed like a glorified label to give the act of illegally downloading copyrighted content. I grew up in the 1990s consuming VHS and cassettes. Now, here was an alternative — a trove of songs, TV and movies, ready for download with a few quick clicks thanks to the magic of so-called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_file_sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;peer-to-peer file-sharing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;technology. For a kid without much money to spend on CDs, this was a godsend. The problem was that so many&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;early programs came loaded with viruses, unreliable files and unstable connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then there was The Pirate Bay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every longtime user of The Pirate Bay seems to remember how they fell in love with the site, which was born in 2003 but remains an online juggernaut today. John, a 35-year-old redditor in London who asked to use a pseudonym, describes discovering The Pirate Bay as “feeling a ray of sunlight, just beckoning me to a better world of pirating without dealing with garbage user interfaces and shit files.” Alex (also a pseudonym, since he’s a practicing lawyer), a 28-year-old in L.A., says The Pirate Bay became “the clear favorite” upon first use, thanks to the organization and layout that felt “way less sketchy” than other platforms. Thomaz Paschoal, one of my college roommates, sums it up best. “It was always easy to find exactly what you wanted, not like, clicking on a link that says Batman and you get some crazy porn movie,” he tells me with a laugh. “It changed everything.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike some early&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerworld.com/article/2588287/networking-peer-to-peer-network.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;file-sharing programs, The Pirate Bay uses a system of torrent files that allows for a faster, more efficient method of downloading content. Instead of receiving a shared file from a single uploader,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossbytes.com/how-torrent-works-what-is-bittorrenting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;torrents create decentralized downloads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, meaning the data is assembled from multiple users in different places rather than the site or program itself. The more people share a file, the faster download speeds you can get.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this general advantage of torrents doesn’t explain why the internet’s love affair with The Pirate Bay remains so strong. Other competitors have succumbed to lawsuits, criminal cases and the competitive marketplace. The people who created and run The Pirate Bay have been smacked by those blows, too. Yet despite widespread legal scrutiny, blockages in multiple countries, millions of dollars in fines and beyond, the site with the iconic mahogany pirate ship logo sails on, supported by an anonymous crowd of diehard pirates who revive the site every time it seems down for good. “It’s absurd to me that this platform still works and it’s still so widely popular, given that it’s so…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;illegal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. I’m really impressed by the longevity,” Paschoal says. “I remember one time when they took down the original URL, the dot-org site, and the next day you could go on Google and find 100 identical Pirate Bay mirror sites with the same torrents.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A decade ago, the Swedish government decided to try and punish the founders of The Pirate Bay, all Swedish men, with a barrage of 34 charges based on copyright infringement. While half of the charges were quickly dropped due to a lack of evidence, the case concluded with an unprecedented result: A year of prison and roughly $3.5 million in fines for the four defendants. Legal experts at the time considered it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.se/20090417/18930&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;the most important file-sharing case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in Europe, as significant as the previous U.S. crackdown against the pioneering P2P service Napster (which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster#Shutdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;effectively died&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;as a result of that verdict).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Copyright cases brought down other legacy names like Kazaa and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/limewire-memes-millennials&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limewire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;as well as two of the biggest torrent sites in the world,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/two-years-on-alleged-kat-founder-continues-to-fight-extradition-180720/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kickass Torrents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/extratorrent-shuts-down-for-good-170517/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ExtraTorrents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Meanwhile, despite widespread concern that the Swedish case would cripple the site, The Pirate Bay lives today, still hosting torrents that have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-oldest-torrents-survived-15-years-of-turmoil-190519/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;survived for 15 years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Part of the reason for the site’s longevity may simply be because it hasn’t been caught red-handed in a jurisdiction with tougher punishments, says&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uidaho.edu/law/people/faculty/abridy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Annemarie Bridy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a professor of law at the University of Idaho with extensive expertise on online piracy issues. “But part of the problem, too, is that there’s this legacy that The Pirate Bay has, where it’s grown into something more than the people who first operated the site,” Bridy tells me. “It’s a phenomenon. And there are people who are just ideologically committed to the operation of The Pirate Bay. For as long as that’s the case, it’s going to be very, very hard to shut down.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the story of a plain-looking website that sprung from the most fertile period of the early internet, blatantly raised its middle fingers at intellectual property laws and copyright owners and lived for what is an eternity in the timeline of digital evolution. It’s thrived, growing from 25 million users to reportedly more than double that figure over the last 10 years, and shows little sign of slowing down. “It’s a testament to what an anonymous crew can do if they really believe in the cause of giving us access to these products that are so corporatized and endlessly monetized,” John says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* * * * *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prosecution of Pirate Bay began in 2006, a little past noon on May 31st, with a raid in a data center in Stockholm. While 65 police officers were enlisted for the high-profile mission, it went off without much drama:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=30HF-m_I6yYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=30HF-m_I6yY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surveillance footage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;shows the men calmly walking into the server room and searching through the aisles (and eventually, covering the cameras up).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;568&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/30HF-m_I6yY?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pirate Bay was initially established three years prior by the Swedish anti-copyright group&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piratbyr%C3%A5n&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Piratbyrån&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and its operations were managed by Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm Warg. The two coders took the ideals of a free, uncensored internet seriously, but also appeared to find some joy in the act of pissing off authorities. In 2004, they created their own internet service provider,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;dubbed PRQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, that had a “no questions asked” hosting policy — even if other ISPs and web hosts had censored a site, it could find safe harbor there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The duo were soon joined by Peter Sunde, a fellow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piratbyr%C3%A5n&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Piratbyrån&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;member, who became a third co-founder of The Pirate Bay and worked as its spokesman. It didn’t take long for the trio to attract negative attention, and in the months leading up to the May 2006 raid, Neij and Svartholm Warg noticed they were being followed and surveilled by private investigators. So Svartholm Warg wasn’t exactly shocked when he heard that police had arrived at the data center on the morning of May 31st. He immediately called Neij, urging him to get to the facility. At that point, the exact purpose of the raid wasn’t clear, but Neij paused before leaving his apartment. If the target was the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;torrent “tracker”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for The Pirate Bay, it would be safest to back up the entire website immediately, Neij thought. So he did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a move that observers now consider the “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-remains-on-top-11-years-after-the-raid-170531/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pivotal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” moment in time for The Pirate Bay’s survival. The confiscation of servers shut down the website, but the backup allowed the site to come back online within just two days (with a new logo featuring the ship&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://g0tmk.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;firing cannonballs at a Hollywood sign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, for kicks). TPB’s founders believed that the crackdown from Swedish authorities came as a result of pressure from powerful international industry trade groups, primarily the Motion Picture Association of America. They also stood defiant in the aftermath. “I’m quite sure we won’t be convicted, anyhow,” Sunde&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080114-swedish-prosecutors-dump-4000-legal-docs-on-the-pirate-bay.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARS Technica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;two years later&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, as prosecutors began assembling the case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime, the founders had work to do, too. They tried to create a physical safe haven for operations by buying the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Isle of Sealand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a human-made structure seven miles off the coast of Britain that’s not technically part of any nation. But they couldn’t raise enough money, and instead “sold” The Pirate Bay off to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/10/who-owns-the-pirate-bay-part-ii/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a shadowy company named Reservella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seychelles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seychelles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, later claiming in court that it was a legit sale despite offering zero evidence of a transaction. Sunde, Svartholm Warg and Neij were also outright arrogant about ignoring content takedown requests from industry groups and copyright holders. One such request from Dreamworks SKG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/05/sp-pirate-bay-cofounder-peter-sunde-in-prison&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;once inspired Svartholm Warg to reply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“It is the opinion of us and our lawyers that you are fucking morons, and that you should please go sodomise yourself with retractable batons.” That attitude didn’t dissipate as the actual trial kicked off in February 2009, with charges of copyright infringement against the three operators and Carl Lundström, a Swedish businessman accused of providing support for TPB.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fact that half the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence on the second day of the trial seemed auspicious, and the three founders remained confident as the examinations dragged on. At one point in the 2013 documentary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2608732/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;TPB AFK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which follows the trial, we see Neij testify to how he literally programmed an email filter to ignore and forward messages that refer to a copyright takedown request. “I get a lot of spam. Spam are emails that I haven’t requested,” Neij concludes with a straight face. (Neij also won applause across the internet for stating that he had literally tweaked Pirate Bay code and fixed a site shutdown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-lives-on-a-decade-after-operators-were-found-guilty-190420/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;while sitting in court&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;during the final trial day.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the attitude — or perhaps because of it, if allegations about the presiding judge’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.networkworld.com/article/2259165/pirate-bay-judge-cleared-of-bias-charges.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bias for pro-copyright organizations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;are to be believed — the four men got hit with guilty convictions on April 17, 2009. They were each sentenced to a year in jail, plus an initial total of about $3.5 million in fines and d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;amages. Once again, Sunde, Svartholm Warg and Neij refused to capitulate. “We can’t pay, and we wouldn’t pay,”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pirate-bay-torrent-download,7582.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sunde said at a press conference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Even if I had the money I would rather burn everything I owned, and I wouldn’t even give them the ashes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, he made a sign with a sheet of paper, reading “I OWE U 31,000,000 SEK,” referring to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Swedish Krona currency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “That’s as close as you’re going to get,” Sunde continued. “We have seen that some people that we don’t know have started collecting donations for us, so we can pay those silly fines. We firmly ask you NOT to do this. Do not gather or send any money. We do not want them since we will not pay any fines!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They may have taken it in stride, with mocking smiles, but the incident divided the trio. Neij immediately bolted from Sweden for Malaysia and migrated into Laos, where he spent much of the next three years and even ended up marrying a Thai woman. He was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/04/pirate-bay-founder-fredrik-neij-arrested-thailand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;arrested in November 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;while crossing into Thailand, and was taken to Sweden to serve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-was-worth-doing-prison-time-for-co-founder-says-160705/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;10 months in jail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Thai officials at the time said&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/fredrik-neij-pirate-bay-co-founder-arrested-in-thailand-1.2822840&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a “U.S.-based movie association,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Swedish&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;government authorities, had hired a lawyer in Thailand to raise flags about Neij’s Interpol warrant with local immigration police and find him. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikileaks.org/sony/emails/emailid/106071&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leaked emails from Sony Pictures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;show MPAA leadership, including Executive Vice President Jan Van Voorn and anti-piracy head Mike Robinson, celebrating Neij’s arrest; Sony attorney Aimee Wolfson adds it’s a “huge win.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Svartholm Warg also went down a similar path, fleeing Sweden for Cambodia, where he would live peacefully until being tracked down and deported in 2012. He served his shortened sentence in Sweden but ended up back in jail on unrelated hacking charges in Denmark, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/pirate-bay-co-founder-released-prison-378055&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ultimately became a free man in 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, cracking jokes about being imprisoned the entire way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sunde, meanwhile, managed to hide out in southern Sweden for two years before being&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/05/sp-pirate-bay-cofounder-peter-sunde-in-prison&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;caught and serving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;his own shortened sentence. “People ask if I would have done anything different if I could,” he told the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Guardian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;while behind bars. “The answer is no. This has been nothing more than five months of wasted time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* * * * *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since their respective releases from jail, the three co-founders have remained fairly low-key. Sunde has been the most visible, creating (and selling) the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;microtransaction app Flattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and being involved in socialist politics, even running for a seat in the European Parliament as the representative of Finland’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pirate Party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Svartholm Warg is reportedly getting back into IT work, albeit behind the scenes. And Neij is back in Southeast Asia, raising a family with his wife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each of the founders say they’re no longer involved in The Pirate Bay. There’s no real way to prove that, but it’s accepted by experts that TPB operates via&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-king-torrents-160814/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an anonymous staff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Three iconoclastic men have been replaced, in other words, by an obscured network of hardcore supporters. What remains is the trio’s vision: that a free and open internet is paramount, that the institution of copyright should be challenged and that running a technologically complex project like TPB is, in the words of Neij,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/eTOKXCEwo_8?t=1140&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“great fun.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;That legacy is hard to fade. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Pirate Bay was operated by a very vocal group of people that didn’t mind confronting copyright holders. They were unique in that sense,” says Ernesto Van der Sar, who uses a pseudonym as editor and founder of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;TorrentFreak.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which covers the industry closely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pirate Bay is no longer the gleaming standard for decentralized file-sharing on the internet, he adds, and it’s easy to find complaints that it’s not as reliable, or feature-rich, as some newer platforms like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2019/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;YTS or 1337x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. But the current proliferation of torrenting, and the evolution of other technologies used for pirating digital content, is directly tied to the experience The Pirate Bay created 15 years ago. Ironically, the raid and trial helped boost its appeal higher than ever — the operators reported that traffic doubled practically overnight after the 2006 raid shut the site down for a day, for starters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Van der Sar notes, though, that even if the site is still up, the 2009 prosecution did shatter the myth that legislators and law enforcement couldn’t actually levy concrete punishments to people who run decentralized file-sharing sites. While the death of Napster had shown the danger of running a file-sharing program that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/questions/617264/difference-between-bittorrent-and-p2p-services-like-napster-limewire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;directly connected people to copyrighted material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the clever tech behind torrents were supposed to create plausible deniability. “So to many people, the site appeared to be invincible, but the prosecution showed that this wasn’t the case. It was a turning point,” he adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps that created a silver lining, of sorts. The Pirate Bay has since been more mobile and flexible than ever, with staffers relocating operations to “the cloud” rather than a physical location, among other savvy moves. Even a massive 2014 raid, which led to a two-month shutter for TPB, didn’t kill the original site. It seems Sunde was right when,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/187iwo/i_am_peter_sunde_cofounder_of_tpb_ama/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;in a Reddit AMA in 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, he wrote, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;TPB being blocked in a country has, in every single attempt, given more traffic to it. It’s like trying to shoot a black hole with a bow and arrow.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Naturally, the site’s biggest fans are relieved for now, but are unsure about how prosecuting tactics will adapt in coming years. Alex says that he has always supported the site as a kind of “Robin Hood” figure, providing content to the masses without unfair price tags. He’s also worried that the political climate around copyright and piracy hasn’t changed much, even with a number of studies that show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;illegal downloads don’t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://entertainment.time.com/2013/03/21/illegal-music-downloads-not-hurting-industry-study-claims/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/how-piracy-benefits-companies-even-if-they-dont-admit-1649353452&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bottom-line revenues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for artists and creators. “The Pirate Bay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;came back, again and again. I don’t know the future, but it’s still standing. But the problem of the system is still there, the persistent pursuit of the government against people who advocate for something like The Pirate Bay,” Alex says. “That hasn’t changed at all.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bridy, the legal expert, agrees that anti-piracy efforts remain a focus of industry groups like the MPAA or the Recording Industry Association of America. She says it’s worth keeping an eye on the decision to extradite the operator of Kickass Torrents,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/two-years-on-alleged-kat-founder-continues-to-fight-extradition-180720/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Artem Vaulin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, to the U.S. for trial. But a critical distinction, she adds, is that torrent sites like The Pirate Bay are no longer the white whales for prosecution. “Most civil efforts are targeted at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8508821/us-trade-rep-stream-ripping-notorious-markets-special-country-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;illegal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;streaming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;services and sites&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;now. They’re more popular in 2019 than ever. So yeah, they’ll keep going after stream rippers and other cases the industry thinks it can win, and where it’s good PR for them,” Bridy tells me. “There is this whole seamy underbelly that’s suing peer-to-peer file-sharing sites, but they’re mostly pornography suits. The trade groups aren’t about that anymore.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I admit I still log onto The Pirate Bay every once in a while, but the evolution of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;legal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;streaming sites like Netflix, Hulu and Spotify has taken a big edge off my piracy appetite. Like Alex, Bridy is quick to observe that affordably priced content remains the “No. 1 fix to piracy.” But we’re also seeing the splitting of streaming services, with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/g00/news/disney-plus-shows-movies-price-release-date-shows-movies-avengers-endgame-hulu/?i10c.ua=1&amp;amp;i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&amp;amp;i10c.dv=19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disney pulling out of Netflix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for its own site and other major networks planning similar platforms. To my eyes, this feels like a consumer threat —&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;now I’m going to have to pay for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;sites to get a similar amount of content?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s a question many people are mulling as they consider the value of their entertainment in 2019. And it’s a question that makes me think The Pirate Bay still has a long journey ahead, even if Sunde has recently been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjpbd/pirate-bay-founder-peter-sunde-i-have-given-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;deeply cynical about TPB and the “lost war”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for a free internet. It also reminds me of a scene in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;TPB AFK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, when the three men were far more idealistic about the world and their role in it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Sunde and Svartholm Warg are at a press conference, where a moderator asks what will happen to The Pirate Bay if the operators are found guilty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Nothing,” Sunde says. He looks at Svartholm Warg, who nods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What are they going to do about it?” the latter adds. “They already tried shutting it down once. They’re welcome to come and fail again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-item__teaser-text serif&quot;&gt;Super-high-speed camera produces a film consisting of 60 consecutive frames.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-item__body serif&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new ultra-fast camera can generate a film of dozens of frames at trillions of frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-speed cameras capture frames on light sensors composed of semiconductors. Such cameras typically save each frame of a sequence on a separate area of the sensor. But inherent limits on the sensor’s size can limit the length of a film to just a few shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feng Chen of Xi’an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi, China, Lidai Wang at the City University of Hong Kong and their colleagues instead expose each frame on separate but overlapping areas of the camera sensor. Each successive frame is imprinted with a random tag before it reaches the sensor. These tags allow the image captured by the sensor to be teased apart into distinct frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this technique, the camera could generate a sequence of up to 60 shots at a rate of almost 4 trillion frames per second. This allowed the team to film a light pulse as it travelled through a material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed intensity--high&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;figure__image&quot; alt=&quot;A 33-picosecond clip produced showing a light pulse travelling through a transparent solid.&quot; data-src=&quot;//media.nature.com/w800/magazine-assets/d41586-019-01625-5/d41586-019-01625-5_16737810.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;figure__caption sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mr10&quot;&gt;The imaging system captures a light pulse (in a slowed video) as it passes through a material, exits the material (at the dashed yellow line) and bounces off a mirror (solid yellow line) back into the material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Y. Lu &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Phys. Rev. Lett.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach could be used to watch high-speed processes — such as the interaction between light and biological tissue in laser surgery — unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>BigInt Shipping in Firefox</title>
<link>https://wingolog.org/archives/2019/05/23/bigint-shipping-in-firefox</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wingolog.org/archives/2019/05/23/bigint-shipping-in-firefox</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to share with folks the results of a project I have been helping out on for the last few months: implementation of &quot;BigInt&quot; in Firefox, which is finally shipping in Firefox 68 (beta).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what's a bigint?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BigInts are a new kind of JavaScript primitive value, like numbers or strings. A BigInt is a true integer: it can take on the value of any finite integer (subject to some arbitrarily large implementation-defined limits, such as the amount of memory in your machine). This contrasts with JavaScript number values, which have the well-known property of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER&quot;&gt;only being able to precisely represent integers between -2&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BigInts are written like &quot;normal&quot; integers, but with an &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; suffix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
var a = 1n;
var b = a + 42n;
b &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 64n
// result: 793209995169510719488n
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the bigint proposal, the usual mathematical operations (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;**&lt;/tt&gt;, and the comparison operators) are extended to operate on bigint values. As a new kind of primitive value, bigint values have their own &lt;tt&gt;typeof&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
typeof 1n
// result: 'bigint'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides allowing for more kinds of math to be easily and efficiently expressed, BigInt also allows for better interoperability with systems that use 64-bit numbers, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20220&quot;&gt;&quot;inodes&quot; in file systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sauleau.com/notes/wasm-bigint.html&quot;&gt;WebAssembly i64 values&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_hrtime_bigint&quot;&gt;high-precision timers&lt;/a&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt&quot;&gt;read more about the BigInt feature over on MDN&lt;/a&gt;, as usual. You might also like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/bigint&quot;&gt;short article on BigInt basics&lt;/a&gt; that V8 engineer Mathias Bynens wrote when Chrome shipped support for BigInt last year. There is an accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/bigint&quot;&gt;language implementation&lt;/a&gt; article as well, for those of y'all that enjoy the nitties and the gritties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can i ship it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try out BigInt in Firefox, simply download a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/&quot;&gt;Firefox Beta&lt;/a&gt;. This version of Firefox will be fully released to the public in a few weeks, on July 9th. If you're reading this in the future, I'm talking about Firefox 68.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BigInt is also shipping already in V8 and Chrome, and my colleague Caio Lima has an project in progress to implement it in JavaScriptCore / WebKit / Safari. Depending on your target audience, BigInt might be deployable already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thanks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must mention that my role in the BigInt work was relatively small; my Igalia colleague Robin Templeton did the bulk of the BigInt implementation work in Firefox, so large ups to them. Hearty thanks also to Mozilla's Jan de Mooij and Jeff Walden for their patient and detailed code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks as well to the V8 engineers for their open source implementation of BigInt fundamental algorithms, as we used many of them in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I need to make one big thank-you, and I hope that you will join me in expressing it. The road to ship anything in a web browser is long; besides the &quot;simple matter of programming&quot; that it is to implement a feature, you need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;specification with buy-in from implementors and web standards people&lt;/a&gt;, you need a good working relationship with a browser vendor, you need willing technical reviewers, you need to follow up on the inevitable security bugs that any browser change causes, and all of this takes time. It's all predicated on having the backing of an organization that's foresighted enough to invest in this kind of long-term, high-reward platform engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard I think all people that work on the web platform should send a big shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techatbloomberg.com&quot;&gt;Tech at Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; for making BigInt possible by underwriting all of &lt;a href=&quot;https://igalia.com/&quot;&gt;Igalia&lt;/a&gt;'s work in this area. Thank you, Bloomberg, and happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;
