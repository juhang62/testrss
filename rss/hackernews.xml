<title>Alphabet’s Chief Legal Officer Stepping Down Amid Investigation</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — David Drummond, the chief legal officer of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and one of its most senior executives, is leaving the internet giant amid an investigation into his relationships with women who worked at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an email sent to employees at Google and Alphabet, Mr. Drummond, who joined Google in 2002, said he planned to leave Alphabet at the end of the month. He said that it was the “right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders” in light of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/google-larry-page-sergey-br.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders&lt;/a&gt;, stepping back from day-to-day roles at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;His resignation comes more than a year after 20,000 Google employees protested &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the company’s handling of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; and inappropriate workplace relationships. The protests were a public reckoning for a permissive work culture that had existed since the company’s early days — exemplified by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;generous exit packages for senior executives&lt;/a&gt; even after they were accused of sexual misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In recent months, Mr. Drummond had come to symbolize how — despite the company’s assertions that it would no longer tolerate such actions — some powerful men in the technology world accused of inappropriate behavior often weathered the storm, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/tech-men-accused-sexual-misconduct-new-jobs-metoo&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;landing new jobs&lt;/a&gt; or keeping their old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some employees inside Google were dismayed that Mr. Drummond was not forced to leave after the details of an extramarital relationship he had with a woman who worked for him became public. The concerns about Mr. Drummond’s workplace romances took on new life when he recently married another woman from Google’s legal department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The departure of Mr. Drummond, who could not be reached for comment on Friday, signals a changing of the guard for Alphabet. He was one of the longest-serving and influential executives at the company. As an outside lawyer for the Silicon Valley firm Wilson Sonsini, he helped draft the original incorporation papers for Google and later became the company’s first general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He was instrumental in many of the company’s prominent and sometimes controversial moves, including the decision to pull out of the Chinese market in 2010 and the legal battle with media companies over copyright claims on YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last month, in announcing that Mr. Page and Mr. Brin planned to step down from executive roles at the company, Alphabet announced that Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, would also lead the parent company. When Google in 2015 created the holding company called Alphabet and became one of its subsidiaries, Mr. Drummond was one of the few executives who was tapped to work for the parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Drummond also oversaw two of Alphabet’s investment arms, GV and CapitalG. At one point, he also served as a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/technology/uber-and-alphabets-rivalry-heats-up-as-director-chooses-sides.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;board member at Uber&lt;/a&gt; after an investment from GV, then called Google Ventures. He stepped down from the Uber board after it became apparent that Uber’s plans for a self-driving car would come into conflict with Google’s own driverless car ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After the departure of Eric Schmidt, Google’s former chief executive, from Alphabet’s board last year, Mr. Drummond was seen as one of the last major links to its past culture problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Jenn Kaiser, an Alphabet spokeswoman, said Mr. Drummond did not receive an exit package. However, his departure had been telegraphed in the last few months as he sold off most of his shares in Alphabet, unloading about $222 million worth of company stock since November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Based on public securities filings, Google has disclosed that it has paid Mr. Drummond at least $258 million, including stock options and grants, since 2006, according to Equilar, an executive compensation consulting firm. That does not include what Mr. Drummond was paid before the company’s lucrative initial public offering in 2004 and excludes some years when his compensation was not public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last year, a committee of independent directors from Alphabet’s board hired a law firm to investigate its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate relationships by current and former executives as part of its legal defense against shareholder lawsuits over its handling of the matters, according to documents viewed by The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The shareholder lawsuits accused the board of enabling the misconduct of Alphabet executives. Among the subjects in the inquiry were Mr. Drummond’s relationships with women at the company, according to the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Drummond faced additional scrutiny in August when Jennifer Blakely, a former senior contracts manager in Google’s legal department, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jennifer.blakely/my-time-at-google-and-after-b0af688ec3ab&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published an essay on Medium&lt;/a&gt; about her relationship with him. She wrote that Google forced her out of the legal department after the birth of their son made it impossible to the hide the relationship. Ms. Blakely was part of the Times article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Her essay also said that Mr. Drummond had other extramarital relationships with women at the company after they split. At the time, Mr. Drummond said he had never started a relationship with “anyone else who was working at Google or Alphabet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In his farewell note, Mr. Drummond did not mention any of the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I know this company is in the best of hands, and I am excited for what the future holds for Google, for Alphabet and for me,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>I almost sold Baremetrics for $5M</title>
<link>https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-almost-sold-baremetrics-for-5m?ck_subscriber_id=1673362</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-almost-sold-baremetrics-for-5m?ck_subscriber_id=1673362</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr In the past 6 months I turned down multiple $3-5m offers and failed to close a $5m sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past six years of Baremetrics’ existence, I’ve received dozens upon dozens of emails from folks interested in acquiring Baremetrics. When you’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://demo.baremetrics.com/&quot;&gt;running a transparent company&lt;/a&gt; that’s growing, it just comes with the territory. Generally these conversations quickly fizzle once they realize I’m not even remotely interested in some quick, 1x revenue sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this past April someone reached out that was capable and interested in spending more, so I started exploring that. I began reaching out for input from friends, investors and advisors and word got out that I had an offer, which ultimately resulted in even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; buyers reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By mid-May I had four different &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofintent.asp&quot;&gt;LOIs&lt;/a&gt; in front of me, with offers ranging from $3-5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, mere weeks prior it wasn’t even remotely on my mind to sell Baremetrics. And now all of the sudden I’m being offered millions of dollars. My brain was spinning. I’ve always sort of assumed that the sale of Baremetrics would one day mean I make a decent chunk of money, but now it was “Hey Josh, you could be a millionaire in a matter of weeks!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There’s always a price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still very torn on the idea. Baremetrics was (and is) still growing and the roadmap we’ve got has some huge things coming. It almost felt like I was selling (pun intended) the company short by taking any of these offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will tell you, especially when things are going well, that they’re not interested in selling their company. But the thing is, there’s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a price. Sure, the price may be some obscenely huge multiple of revenue, but &lt;em&gt;there’s a price&lt;/em&gt;. And that price could fluctuate based on any number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this came at a time where, personally, life was…draining. Outside of work I wasn’t in a great place mentally. I was dealing with some family issues that were consuming every ounce of my mental energy. I was depressed, anxious and the most stressed I’ve ever been and the prospect of being able to sell the company and give myself and my brain a break was very appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I accepted the top offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A long trip down a dead end road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the thing with an LOI is that it isn’t a purchase agreement. It’s just a way for an interested buyer to formally say, “We’re interested at $X amount.” After you accept an LOI, you begin the painfully tedious due diligence process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In due diligence, you’re essentially asked to pull together every single legal and financial document you or your team has &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; interacted with over the existence of your business. For even the most organized person, this is a completely overwhelming task and takes many weeks, if not months, to properly do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I accepted an offer for $4.95m, ~3.75x our revenue at the time, and it was off to the races on pulling together all of those due diligence documents. We’d planned on closing in mid-August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attorneys got to work. I was having regular calls with our CPA and my financial advisor to figure out what all this meant for myself and our team. I was working on making sure everyone on our team would be taken care of and have jobs available to them as part of the transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time I was also having weekly calls with the buyer, checking in as they did their own research and (theoretically) had their lawyers looking over things while we did our work with diligence documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then things started to get a bit…odd. The buyer kept hesitating to give us intros to their legal counsel. They’d opted to let our counsel write the Stock Purchase Agreement (which is very atypical because we’d obviously write it in our favor). They missed their own deadlines and started accusing us that we were holding the process up when we were getting them the things they asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper we got in to this, the worse I was feeling about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a matter of days before the planned closing date, they ghosted us completely. As in stopped answering emails, stopped answering calls. Just…fell off the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d spent nearly $20,000 on legal fees and months of time gathering all the docs for proper due diligence, and they just disappeared. It was crushing. I was (and still am) furious with them. They wasted an epic amount of our time and money and then crawled in to a hole when they realized they couldn’t do the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, it turns out they’d misrepresented their funding situation at the beginning. They claimed that they had the funds available when they made their offer. That’s key, because I wasn’t interested in doing a deal with someone who was going to have to go out and raise money to do it. But that’s exactly the situation we found ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the deal progressed we realized they actually &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; have the funding but were “working hard to get their investors on board”. We were so far in that it seemed we might as well see it through. But, surprise, they couldn’t do it and so they bailed in the most cowardly way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I went back to the drawing board to try and salvage all the work that’d been done with other interested buyers, but at the end of the day, none of the other offers (which were anywhere from $1m to $4.5m) made economic, logistical or cultural sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after 6 months of what was one the greatest emotional rollercoaster of my existence, I didn’t sell Baremetrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Absorbing insanity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, I feel like my job as CEO and Founder is to absorb all of the insane parts of running a business so my team can focus on building, learning and enjoying their jobs. They didn’t sign up to get on the rollercoaster. I did. I hated keeping all of this from the team, but in hindsight I’m very glad they didn’t get pulled in to all of it, especially as things started to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not one to drag things out. Once I know if a desired outcome is or isn’t possible, I make decisions instantly and move on. That’s how I felt with this. Once I realized we didn’t have any offers that I was happy with, I pouted for a day, then immediately jumped back in to running the company and planning out the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, I feel an immense sense of relief to have this season over with. I’m as excited as ever to be able to have my focus back on building Baremetrics as both a product and a company. We’re hiring multiple new roles and we’ve got some pretty great things in the pipeline. On top of that I get to keep working with the amazing people on our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just wrapped up our fifth company retreat and 2020 will be the biggest year yet for us!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>War Is a Racket (1933)</title>
<link>https://www.wanttoknow.info/warisaracket</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wanttoknow.info/warisaracket</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That war is a racket has been told us by many, but rarely by one of this stature. Though he died in 1940, the highly decorated &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smedley_Butler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;General Butler&lt;/a&gt; (two esteemed Medals of Honor) deserves to be heralded for his timeless message, which rings true today more than ever. His riveting 1935 book &lt;em&gt;War is a Racket&lt;/em&gt; merits inclusion as required reading for every high school student, and for every member of our armed forces today. Below is a ten-page summary of the best of this powerful exposé. For a concise, two-page version, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.WantToKnow.info/war/war-corruption&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excerpt from a speech delivered in 1933 by General Smedley Butler, USMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War is just a racket. There are only two things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights. War for any other reason is simply a racket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem odd for me, a military man to adopt such a comparison. Truthfulness compels me to. I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I helped make Mexico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER ONE: War Is A Racket &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small &quot;inside&quot; group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the World War [I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. &lt;strong&gt;At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War.&lt;/strong&gt; That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows. &lt;em&gt;[Please note these are 1935 U.S. dollars. To adjust for inflation, multiply all figures &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;X 15 or more&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of these war millionaires shouldered a rifle? How many of them dug a trench? How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat-infested dug-out? How many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights, ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets? How many of them were wounded or killed in battle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of war nations acquire additional territory, if they are victorious. They just take it. This newly acquired territory promptly is exploited by the few – the selfsame few who wrung dollars out of blood in the war. The general public shoulders the bill. And what is this bill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bill renders a horrible accounting. Newly placed gravestones. Mangled bodies. Shattered minds. Broken hearts and homes. Economic instability. Depression and all its attendant miseries. Back-breaking taxation for generations and generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a great many years, as a soldier, I had a suspicion that war was a racket; not until I retired to civil life did I fully realize it. Now that I see the international war clouds gathering, as they are today, I must face it and speak out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Again they are choosing sides. France and Russia met and agreed to stand side by side. Italy and Austria hurried to make a similar agreement. Poland and Germany cast sheep's eyes at each other. All of them are looking ahead to war. Not the people – not those who fight and pay and die – only those who foment wars and remain safely at home to profit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 40,000,000 men under arms in the world today, and our statesmen and diplomats have the temerity to say that war is not in the making. Hell's bells! Are these 40,000,000 men being trained to be dancers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in Italy, to be sure. Premier Mussolini knows what they are being trained for. He, at least, is frank enough to speak out. The publication of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said:  &quot;And above all, Fascism… believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace…War alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly Mussolini means exactly what he says. His well-trained army, his great fleet of planes, and even his navy are ready for war. His recent stand at the side of Hungary in the latter's dispute with Yugoslavia showed that. And the hurried mobilization of his troops on the Austrian border after the assassination of Dollfuss showed it too. There are others in Europe too whose sabre rattling presages war, sooner or later. Herr Hitler, with his rearming Germany and his constant demands for more and more arms, is an equal if not greater menace to peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, all over, nations are camping in their arms. The mad dogs of Europe are on the loose. The trend is to poison us against the Japanese. What does the &quot;open door&quot; policy to China mean to us? Our trade with China is about $90,000,000 a year. Or the Philippine Islands? We have spent about $600,000,000 in the Philippines in thirty-five years and we (our bankers and industrialists and speculators) have private investments there of less than $200,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to save that China trade of about $90,000,000, or to protect these private investments of less than $200,000,000 in the Philippines, we would be all stirred up to hate Japan and go to war – a war that might well cost us tens of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of lives of Americans, and many more hundreds of thousands of physically maimed and mentally unbalanced men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, for this loss, there would be a compensating profit – fortunes would be made. Millions and billions of dollars would be piled up. By a few. Munitions makers. Bankers. Ship builders. Manufacturers. Meat packers. Speculators. They would fare well. Yes, they are getting ready for another war. Why shouldn't they? It pays high dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does it profit the men who are killed? What does it profit their mothers and sisters, their wives and their sweethearts? What does it profit their children? What does it profit anyone except the very few to whom war means huge profits? Yes, and what does it profit the nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take our own case. Until 1898 we didn't own a bit of territory outside the mainland of North America. At that time our national debt was a little more than $1,000,000,000. Then we became &quot;internationally minded.&quot; We forgot, or shunted aside, George Washington's warning about &quot;entangling alliances.&quot; We went to war. We acquired outside territory. At the end of the World War period, as a direct result of our fiddling in international affairs, our national debt had jumped to over $25,000,000,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been far cheaper (not to say safer) for the average American who pays the bills to stay out of foreign entanglements. For a very few this racket, like bootlegging and other underworld rackets, brings fancy profits, but the cost of operations is always transferred to the people – who do not profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER TWO: Who Makes The Profits? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World War cost the United States some $52,000,000,000. Figure it out. That means $400 &lt;em&gt;[over $6,000 in today's dollars]&lt;/em&gt; to every American man, woman, and child. And we haven't paid the debt yet. We are paying it, our children will pay it, and our children's children probably still will be paying the cost of that war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The normal profits of a business concern in the United States are 6, 8, 10, and sometimes 12%. But war-time profits – ah! that is another matter – 20, 60, 100, 300, and even 1,800% – the sky is the limit. All that traffic will bear. Uncle Sam has the money. Let's get it. Of course, it isn't put that crudely in war time. It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and &quot;we must all put our shoulders to the wheel,&quot; but the profits jump and leap and skyrocket – and are safely pocketed. Let's just take a few examples.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take our friends the du Ponts, the powder people – didn't one of them testify before a Senate committee recently that their powder won the war? Or saved the world for democracy? How did they do in the war? Well, the average earnings of the du Ponts for the period 1910 to 1914 were $6,000,000 a year. It wasn't much, but the du Ponts managed to get along on it. Now let's look at their average yearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918. Fifty-eight million dollars a year profit we find! Nearly ten times that of normal times, and the profits of normal times were pretty good. An increase in profits of more than 950 per cent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take one of our little steel companies that patriotically shunted aside the making of rails and girders and bridges to manufacture war materials. Well, their 1910 - 1914 yearly earnings averaged $6,000,000. Then came the war. And, like loyal citizens, Bethlehem Steel promptly turned to munitions making. Did their profits jump – or did they let Uncle Sam in for a bargain? Well, their 1914 - 1918 average was $49,000,000 a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, let's take United States Steel. The normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105,000,000 a year. Not bad. Then along came the war and up went the profits. The average yearly profit for the period 1914 - 1918 was $240,000,000. Not bad. There you have some of the steel and powder earnings. Let's look at something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little copper, perhaps. That always does well in war times. Anaconda, for instance. Average yearly earnings during the pre-war years 1910 - 1914 of $10,000,000. During the war years 1914 - 1918 profits leaped to $34,000,000 per year. Or Utah Copper. Average of $5,000,000 per year during the 1910 - 1914 period. Jumped to an average of $21,000,000 yearly profits for the war period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's group these five, with three smaller companies. The total yearly average profits of the pre-war period 1910 - 1914 were $137,480,000. Then along came the war. The average yearly profits for this group skyrocketed to $408,300,000. A little increase in profits of approximately 200 per cent. Does war pay? It paid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they aren't the only ones. There are still others. Let's take leather. For the three-year period before the war the total profits of Central Leather Company were $3,500,000. That was approximately $1,167,000 a year. Well, in 1916 Central Leather returned a profit of $15,000,000, a small increase of 1,100 per cent. That's all. The General Chemical Company averaged a profit for the three years before the war of a little over $800,000 a year. Came the war, and the profits jumped to $12,000,000 – a leap of 1,400 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Nickel Company – and you can't have a war without nickel – showed an increase in profits from a mere average of $4,000,000 a year to $73,000,000 yearly. Not bad? An increase of more than 1,700 per cent. American Sugar Refining Company averaged $2,000,000 a year for the three years before the war. In 1916 a profit of $6,000,000 was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to Senate Document No. 259. The Sixty-Fifth Congress, reporting on corporate earnings and government revenues. Considering the profits of 122 meat packers, 153 cotton manufacturers, 299 garment makers, 49 steel plants, and 340 coal producers during the war. Profits under 25 per cent were exceptional. For instance the coal companies made between 100 per cent and 7,856 per cent on their capital stock during the war. The Chicago packers doubled and tripled their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And let us not forget the bankers who financed the great war. If anyone had the cream of the profits it was the bankers. Being partnerships rather than incorporated organizations, they do not have to report to stockholders. And their profits were as secret as they were immense. How the bankers made their millions and their billions I do not know, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.WantToKnow.info/financialbankingcoverup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;those little secrets&lt;/a&gt; never become public – even before a Senate investigatory body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how other patriotic industrialists and speculators chiseled their way into war profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the shoe people. They like war. It brings business with abnormal profits. They made huge profits on sales abroad to our allies. Perhaps, like the munitions manufacturers and armament makers, they also sold to the enemy. For a dollar is a dollar whether it comes from Germany or from France. But they did well by Uncle Sam too. &lt;strong&gt;They sold Uncle Sam 35,000,000 pairs of hobnailed service shoes. There were 4,000,000 soldiers. Eight pairs, and more, to a soldier. My regiment during the war had only one pair to a soldier. Some of these shoes probably are still in existence. They were good shoes. But when the war was over Uncle Sam has a matter of 25,000,000 pairs left over. Bought – and paid for. Profits recorded and pocketed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was still lots of leather left. So the leather people sold your Uncle Sam hundreds of thousands of McClellan saddles for the cavalry. But there wasn't any American cavalry overseas! Somebody had to get rid of this leather, however. Somebody had to make a profit in it – so we had a lot of McClellan saddles. And we probably have those yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also somebody had a lot of mosquito netting. They sold your Uncle Sam 20,000,000 mosquito nets for the use of the soldiers overseas. I suppose the boys were expected to put it over them as they tried to sleep in muddy trenches – one hand scratching cooties on their backs and the other making passes at scurrying rats. Well, not one of these mosquito nets ever got to France!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, these thoughtful manufacturers wanted to make sure that no soldier would be without his mosquito net, so 40,000,000 additional yards of mosquito netting were sold to Uncle Sam. There were pretty good profits in mosquito netting in those days, even if there were no mosquitoes in France. I suppose, if the war had lasted just a little longer, the enterprising mosquito netting manufacturers would have sold your Uncle Sam a couple of consignments of mosquitoes to plant in France so that more mosquito netting would be in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airplane and engine manufacturers felt they, too, should get their just profits out of this war. Why not? Everybody else was getting theirs. So $1,000,000,000 – count them if you live long enough – was spent by Uncle Sam in building airplane engines that never left the ground! Not one plane, or motor, out of the billion dollars worth ordered, ever got into a battle in France. Just the same the manufacturers made their little profit of 30, 100, or perhaps 300%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undershirts for soldiers cost 14¢ [cents] to make and uncle Sam paid 30¢ to 40¢ each for them – a nice little profit for the undershirt manufacturer. And the stocking manufacturer and the uniform manufacturers and the cap manufacturers and the steel helmet manufacturers – all got theirs. When the war was over some 4,000,000 sets of equipment – knapsacks and the things that go to fill them – crammed warehouses on this side. Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have changed the contents. But the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them – and they will do it all over again the next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were lots of brilliant ideas for profit making during the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One very versatile patriot sold Uncle Sam twelve dozen 48-inch wrenches. Oh, they were very nice wrenches. The only trouble was that there was only one nut ever made that was large enough for these wrenches. That is the one that holds the turbines at Niagara Falls.&lt;/strong&gt; Well, after Uncle Sam had bought them and the manufacturer had pocketed the profit, the wrenches were put on freight cars and shunted all around the United States in an effort to find a use for them. When the Armistice was signed it was indeed a sad blow to the wrench manufacturer. He was just about to make some nuts to fit the wrenches. Then he planned to sell these, too, to your Uncle Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipbuilders felt they should come in on some of it, too. They built a lot of ships that made a lot of profit. More than $3,000,000,000 worth. Some of the ships were all right. But $635,000,000 worth of them were made of wood and wouldn't float! The seams opened up – and they sank. We paid for them, though. And somebody pocketed the profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been estimated by statisticians and economists and researchers that the war cost your Uncle Sam $52,000,000,000. Of this sum, $39,000,000,000 was expended in the actual war itself. This expenditure yielded $16,000,000,000 in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way. This $16,000,000,000 profits is not to be sneezed at. It is quite a tidy sum. And it went to a very few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate committee probe of the munitions industry and its wartime profits, despite its sensational disclosures, hardly has scratched the surface. Even so, it has had some effect. The State Department has been studying &quot;for some time&quot; methods of keeping out of war. The War Department suddenly decides it has a wonderful plan to spring. The Administration names a committee – with the War and Navy Departments ably represented under the chairmanship of a Wall Street speculator – to limit profits in war time. To what extent isn't suggested. Hmmm. Possibly the profits of 300 and 600 and 1,600 per cent of those who turned blood into gold in the World War would be limited to some smaller figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, however, the plan does not call for any limitation of losses – that is, the losses of those who fight the war. As far as I have been able to ascertain there is nothing in the scheme to limit a soldier to the loss of but one eye, or one arm, or to limit his wounds to one or two or three. Or to limit the loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in this scheme, apparently, that says not more than 12 per cent of a regiment shall be wounded in battle, or that not more than 7 per cent in a division shall be killed. Of course, the committee cannot be bothered with such trifling matters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER THREE: Who Pays The Bills? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who provides the profits – these nice little profits of 20, 100, 300, 1,500 and 1,800 per cent? We all pay them – in taxation. We paid the bankers their profits when we bought Liberty Bonds at $100.00 and sold them back at $84 or $86 to the bankers. These bankers collected $100 plus.&lt;/strong&gt; It was a simple manipulation. The bankers control the security marts. It was easy for them to depress the price of these bonds. Then all of us – the people – got frightened and sold the bonds at $84 or $86. The bankers bought them. Then these same bankers stimulated a boom and government bonds went to par – and above. Then the bankers collected their profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't believe this, visit the American cemeteries on the battlefields abroad. Or visit any of the veteran's hospitals in the United States. On a tour of the country, in the midst of which I am at the time of this writing, &lt;strong&gt;I have visited eighteen government hospitals for veterans. In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men – men who were the pick of the nation eighteen years ago.&lt;/strong&gt; The very able chief surgeon at the government hospital; at Milwaukee, where there are 3,800 of the living dead, told me that mortality among veterans is three times as great as among those who stayed at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the fields and offices and factories and classrooms and put into the ranks. There they were remolded; they were made over; they were made to &quot;about face&quot; to regard murder as the order of the day. They were put shoulder to shoulder and, through mass psychology, they were entirely changed. We used them for a couple of years and trained them to think nothing at all of killing or of being killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, suddenly, we discharged them and told them to make another &quot;about face&quot;! This time they had to do their own readjustment, sans [&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;] mass psychology, sans officers' aid and advice and sans nation-wide propaganda. We didn't need them any more. So we scattered them about without any &quot;three-minute&quot; or &quot;Liberty Loan&quot; speeches or parades. Many, too many, of these fine young boys are eventually destroyed, mentally, because they could not make that final &quot;about face&quot; alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the government hospital in Marion, Indiana, 1,800 of these boys are in pens! Five hundred of them in a barracks with steel bars and wires all around outside the buildings and on the porches. These already have been mentally destroyed. These boys don't even look like human beings. Oh, the looks on their faces! Physically, they are in good shape; mentally, they are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands and thousands of these cases, and more and more are coming in all the time. The tremendous excitement of the war, the sudden cutting off of that excitement – the young boys couldn't stand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a part of the bill. So much for the dead – they have paid their part of the war profits. So much for the mentally and physically wounded – they are paying now their share of the war profits. But the others paid, too – they paid with heartbreaks when they tore themselves away from their firesides and their families to don the uniform of Uncle Sam – on which a profit had been made. They paid another part in the training camps where they were regimented and drilled while others took their jobs and their places in the lives of their communities. The paid for it in the trenches where they shot and were shot; where they were hungry for days at a time; where they slept in the mud and the cold and in the rain – with the moans and shrieks of the dying for a horrible lullaby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't forget – the soldier paid part of the dollars and cents bill too. Up to and including the Spanish-American War, we had a prize system, and soldiers and sailors fought for money. During the Civil War they were paid bonuses, in many instances, before they went into service. The government, or states, paid as high as $1,200 for an enlistment. In the Spanish-American War they gave prize money. When we captured any vessels, the soldiers all got their share – at least, they were supposed to. Then it was found that we could reduce the cost of wars by taking all the prize money and keeping it, but conscripting [&lt;em&gt;drafting&lt;/em&gt;] the soldier anyway. Then soldiers couldn't bargain for their labor, Everyone else could bargain, but the soldier couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napoleon once said, &quot;All men are enamored of decorations... They positively hunger for them.&quot; So by developing the Napoleonic system – the medal business – the government learned it could get soldiers for less money, because the boys liked to be decorated. Until the Civil War there were no medals. Then the Congressional Medal of Honor was handed out. It made enlistments easier. After the Civil War no new medals were issued until the Spanish-American War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the World War, we used propaganda to make the boys accept conscription. They were made to feel ashamed if they didn't join the army. So vicious was this war propaganda that even God was brought into it.&lt;/strong&gt; With few exceptions our clergymen joined in the clamor to kill, kill, kill. To kill the Germans. God is on our side. It is His will that the Germans be killed. And in Germany, the good pastors called upon the Germans to kill the allies ... to please the same God. That was a part of the propaganda, built up to make people war conscious and murder conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. This was the &quot;war to end all wars.&quot; This was the &quot;war to make the world safe for democracy.&quot; No one mentioned to them, as they marched away, that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here. No one told them that the ships on which they were going to cross might be torpedoed by submarines built with United States patents. They were just told it was to be a &quot;glorious adventure.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, having stuffed patriotism down their throats, it was decided to make them help pay for the war, too. So, we gave them the large salary of $30 a month. All they had to do for this munificent sum was to leave their dear ones behind, give up their jobs, lie in swampy trenches, eat canned willy (when they could get it) and kill and kill and kill ... and be killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! Half of that wage (just a little more than a riveter in a shipyard or a laborer in a munitions factory safe at home made in a day) was promptly taken from him to support his dependents, so that they would not become a charge upon his community. Then we made him pay what amounted to accident insurance – something the employer pays for in an enlightened state – and that cost him $6 a month. He had less than $9 a month left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the most crowning insolence of all – he was virtually blackjacked into paying for his own ammunition, clothing, and food by being made to buy Liberty Bonds. Most soldiers got no money at all on pay days. We made them buy Liberty Bonds at $100 and then we bought them back – when they came back from the war and couldn't find work – at $84 and $86. And the soldiers bought about $2,000,000,000 worth of these bonds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the soldier pays the greater part of the bill. His family pays too. They pay it in the same heart-break that he does. As he suffers, they suffer. At nights, as he lay in the trenches and watched shrapnel burst about him, they lay home in their beds and tossed sleeplessly – his father, his mother, his wife, his sisters, his brothers, his sons, and his daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he returned home minus an eye, or minus a leg or with his mind broken, they suffered too – as much as and even sometimes more than he. Yes, and they, too, contributed their dollars to the profits of the munitions makers and bankers and shipbuilders and the manufacturers and the speculators made. They, too, bought Liberty Bonds and contributed to the profit of the bankers after the Armistice in the hocus-pocus of manipulated Liberty Bond prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even now the families of the wounded men and of the mentally broken and those who never were able to readjust themselves are still suffering and still paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER FOUR: How To Smash This Racket! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's a racket, all right. A few profit – and the many pay. But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by disarmament conferences. You can't eliminate it by peace parleys at Geneva. Well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions. &lt;strong&gt;It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labor before the nations manhood can be conscripted. One month before the Government can conscript the young men of the nation – it must conscript capital and industry and labor. &lt;strong&gt;Let the officers and the directors and the high-powered executives of our armament factories and our munitions makers and our shipbuilders and our airplane builders and the manufacturers of all the other things that provide profit in war time as well as the bankers and the speculators, be conscripted – to get $30 a month, the same wage as the lads in the trenches get.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the workers in these plants get the same wages – all the workers, all presidents, all executives, all directors, all managers, all bankers – yes, and all generals and all admirals and all officers and all politicians and all government office holders – everyone in the nation be restricted to a total monthly income not to exceed that paid to the soldier in the trenches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let all these kings and tycoons and masters of business and all those workers in industry and all our senators and governors and majors pay half of their monthly $30 wage to their families and pay war risk insurance and buy Liberty Bonds. Why shouldn't they? They aren't running any risk of being killed or of having their bodies mangled or their minds shattered. They aren't sleeping in muddy trenches. They aren't hungry. The soldiers are! Give capital and industry and labor thirty days to think it over and you will find, by that time, there will be no war. That will smash the war racket – that and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am a little too optimistic. Capital still has some say. So capital won't permit the taking of the profit out of war until the people – those who do the suffering and still pay the price – make up their minds that those they elect to office shall do their bidding, and not that of the profiteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another step necessary in this fight to smash the war racket is the limited plebiscite to determine whether a war should be declared. A plebiscite not of all the voters but merely of those who would be called upon to do the fighting and dying. There wouldn't be very much sense in having a 76-year-old president of a munitions factory or the flat-footed head of an international banking firm or the cross-eyed manager of a uniform manufacturing plant – all of whom see visions of tremendous profits in the event of war – voting on whether the nation should go to war or not. They never would be called upon to shoulder arms – to sleep in a trench and to be shot. Only those who would be called upon to risk their lives for their country should have the privilege of voting to determine whether the nation should go to war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a simple matter each year for the men coming of military age to register in their communities as they did in the draft during the World War and be examined physically. Those who could pass and who would therefore be called upon to bear arms in the event of war would be eligible to vote in a limited plebiscite. They should be the ones to have the power to decide – and not a Congress few of whose members are within the age limit and fewer still of whom are in physical condition to bear arms. Only those who must suffer should have the right to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A third step in this business of smashing the war racket is to make certain that our military forces are truly forces for defense only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each session of Congress the question of further naval appropriations comes up. The swivel-chair admirals of Washington (and there are always a lot of them) are very adroit lobbyists. And they are smart. They don't shout that &quot;We need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation.&quot; Oh no. First of all, they let it be known that America is menaced by a great naval power. Almost any day, these admirals will tell you, the great fleet of this supposed enemy will strike suddenly and annihilate 125,000,000 people. Just like that. Then they begin to cry for a larger navy. For what? To fight the enemy? Oh my, no. Oh, no. For defense purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, incidentally, they announce maneuvers in the Pacific. For defense. Uh, huh. The Pacific is a great big ocean. We have a tremendous coastline on the Pacific. Will the maneuvers be off the coast, two or three hundred miles? Oh, no. The maneuvers will be two thousand, yes, perhaps even thirty-five hundred miles, off the coast. The Japanese, a proud people, of course will be pleased beyond expression to see the United States fleet so close to Nippon's shores. Even as pleased as would be the residents of California were they to dimly discern through the morning mist, the Japanese fleet playing at war games off Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ships of our navy, it can be seen, should be specifically limited, by law, to within 200 miles of our coastline. Had that been the law in 1898 the Maine would never have gone to Havana Harbor. She never would have been blown up. There would have been no war with Spain with its attendant loss of life.&lt;/strong&gt; Two hundred miles is ample, in the opinion of experts, for defense purposes. Our nation cannot start an offensive war if its ships can't go further than 200 miles from the coastline. Planes might be permitted to go as far as 500 miles from the coast for purposes of reconnaissance. And the army should never leave the territorial limits of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarize: Three steps must be taken to smash the war racket: 1.) We must take the profit out of war; 2.) We must permit the youth of the land who would bear arms to decide whether or not there should be war; 3.) We must limit our military forces to home defense purposes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTER FIVE : To Hell With War!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a fool as to believe that war is a thing of the past. I know the people do not want war, but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another war. Looking back, &lt;strong&gt;Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform that he had &quot;kept us out of war&quot; and on the implied promise that he would &quot;keep us out of war.&quot; Yet, five months later he asked Congress to declare war on Germany.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that five-month interval the people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds. The 4,000,000 young men who put on uniforms and marched or sailed away were not asked whether they wanted to go forth to suffer and die. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An allied commission, it may be recalled, came over shortly before the war declaration and called on the President. The President summoned a group of advisers. The head of the commission spoke. Stripped of its diplomatic language, this is what he told the President and his group: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;There is no use kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the allies is lost. We now owe you (American bankers, munitions makers, American manufacturers, speculators, American exporters) five or six billion dollars. If we lose (and without the help of the United States we must lose) we, England, France and Italy, cannot pay back this money ... and Germany won't. So.....&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations were concerned, and had the press been invited to be present at that conference, or had radio been available to broadcast the proceedings, America never would have entered the World War.&lt;/strong&gt; But this conference, like all war discussions, was shrouded in utmost secrecy. When our boys were sent off to war they were told it was a &quot;war to make the world safe for democracy&quot; and a &quot;war to end all wars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, eighteen years after, the world has less of democracy than it had then. Besides, what business is it of ours whether Russia or Germany or England or France or Italy or Austria live under democracies or monarchies? Whether they are Fascists or Communists? Our problem is to preserve our own democracy. And very little, if anything, has been accomplished to assure us that the World War was really the war to end all wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we have had disarmament conferences and limitations of arms conferences. They don't mean a thing. One has just failed; the results of another have been nullified. We send our professional soldiers and our sailors and our politicians and our diplomats to these conferences. And what happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional soldiers and sailors don't want to disarm. No admiral wants to be without a ship. No general wants to be without a command. Both mean men without jobs. They are not for disarmament. They cannot be for limitations of arms. &lt;strong&gt;And at all these conferences, lurking in the background but all-powerful, just the same, are the sinister agents of those who profit by war. They see to it that these conferences do not disarm or seriously limit armaments. &lt;/strong&gt;The chief aim of any power at any of these conferences has not been to achieve disarmament to prevent war but rather to get more armament for itself and less for any potential foe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one way to disarm with any semblance of practicability. That is for all nations to get together and scrap every ship, every gun, every rifle, every tank, every war plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So ... I say, TO HELL WITH WAR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine if we took General Butler's advice and in wartime forced corporations to join our soldiers in making sacrifices for their country. &lt;strong&gt;We could pass laws which guarantee that corporate profits decrease during war rather than increase.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you think that wars would still drag on for years as in Vietnam and Iraq? Please help to make this a reality by sending this information to your friends and colleagues and contacting your government representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Was Google’s Head of International Relations. Here’s Why I Left</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil.” Things have changed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4500/1*ULFWasfUdIjKAfVtAF3d3w.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ross LaJeunesse, Democratic Candidate for U.S. Senate in Maine.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I walked out the door on my last day as Google’s Head of International Relations**, **I couldn’t help but think of my first day at the company. I had exchanged a wood-paneled office, a suit and tie, and the job of wrestling California’s bureaucracy as Governor Schwarzenegger’s deputy chief of staff for a laptop, jeans, and a promise that I’d be making the world better and more equal, under the simple but powerful guidance “Don’t be evil.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined Google in 2008, when those words still mattered. I saw them used to guide product designs that put the company’s success above a user’s privacy, such as during the development of Google’s ill-fated social network, Buzz. I used those words myself in 2010 as Head of Public Policy for Asia Pacific, when I executed the company’s landmark** **decision to stop censoring Search results in China, putting human rights ahead of the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had first entered the Chinese market in 2006. At the time, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin said that Google would only stay if the company’s presence was doing more good than harm — that users were getting more information than before, even if there was censorship of some topics. But over the years, the list of items that the Chinese government demanded we censor grew significantly, and after the Chinese government attempted to hack into the Gmail accounts of human rights advocates in 2009, Larry and Sergey decided it was time to re-assess the 2006 decision. After a series of intense discussions with other executives, they decided that the only way to continue providing Search in China while adhering to the “Don’t be evil” mantra was to cease cooperation with the government’s censorship requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew this would cause a very public confrontation with the government, although we were never sure how bad it would get. In China, the government not only demands full access to a company’s user data and infrastructure, it also expects the full cooperation of companies to ensure that Chinese users see only content that is in line with government standards. For example, on a Maps product, the government requires that all geographic labels and information be approved by the government in advance, and that any user-generated content be strictly controlled by the company to avoid publication of anything the government deems “problematic,” which can be difficult to define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 2010 decision to stop cooperating with Chinese government censorship on Search results was the first time a non-Chinese corporation stood up to the Chinese government. In doing so, Google put everything on the line — its future in the world’s fastest-growing internet market, billions of dollars in profit, even the safety of our Chinese employees. At one point, I began planning for a possible mass evacuation of all our Google employees based in China, as well as their families. Although difficult, I was intensely proud of the principled approach the company took in making this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the decision infuriated not only the Chinese government, but also frustrated some Google product executives eyeing the huge market and its accompanying profits. In fact, within a year of the 2010 decision, executives for the Maps and Android products began pushing to launch their products in China. I argued strenuously against these plans, knowing that a complete turn-around in our approach would make us complicit in human rights violations, and cause outrage among civil society and the many western governments which had applauded our 2010 decision. I also explained that none of these plans would move forward because the Chinese government was furious with us, and would refuse to meet with us to even discuss these projects. In fact, over the next two years, the Chinese government only agreed to meet with us once, when relatively low-level staff at the Ministry of Land and Resources politely listened as we asked about launching a Maps product. When we affirmed that our Maps product would also not comply with censorship requirements, they stopped responding to additional requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After close to three years in Asia, the company asked me to be Head of International Relations in late 2012, a role responsible for Google’s relationships with diplomats, civil society and international organizations like the UN, and for global issues like trade, internet governance and free expression. As I was growing in seniority and responsibility, the company was growing rapidly in size and revenue — from an already large and successful company to a tech behemoth that intersects with the daily lives of billions of people across the globe. The number of employees was also growing quickly, with new staff and executives being hired to develop products and pursue new lines of business, such as Cloud computing, in every corner of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my new role, my team and I continued to engage with product executives who were increasingly frustrated by the phenomenal growth in the Chinese market and pushed hard for our re-entry into China. I was alarmed when I learned in 2017 that the company had begun moving forward with the development of a new version of a censored Search product for China, codenamed “Dragonfly.” But Dragonfly was only one of several developments that concerned those of us who still believed in the mantra of “Don’t be evil.” I was also concerned that Cloud executives were actively pursuing deals with the Saudi government, given its horrible record of human rights abuses. Cloud executives made no secret of the fact that they wanted to hire their own policy team, which would effectively block any review of their contracts by my team. Finally, in December 2017, Google announced the establishment of the Google Center for Artificial Intelligence in Beijing — something that completely surprised me, and made it clear to me that I no longer had the ability to influence the numerous product developments and deals being pursued by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to advocate for the adoption of a company-wide, formal Human Rights Program that would publicly commit Google to adhere to human rights principles found in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, provide a mechanism for product and engineering teams to seek internal review of product design elements, and formalize the use of Human Rights Impact Assessments for all major product launches and market entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But each time I recommended a Human Rights Program, senior executives came up with an excuse to say no. At first, they said human rights issues were better handled within the product teams, rather than starting a separate program. But the product teams weren’t trained to address human rights as part of their work. When I went back to senior executives to again argue for a program, they then claimed to be worried about increasing the company’s legal liability. We provided the opinion of outside experts who re-confirmed that these fears were unfounded. At this point, a colleague was suddenly re-assigned to lead the policy team discussions for Dragonfly. As someone who had consistently advocated for a human rights-based approach, I was being sidelined from the on-going conversations on whether to launch Dragonfly. I then realized that the company had never intended to incorporate human rights principles into its business and product decisions. Just when Google needed to double down on a commitment to human rights, it decided to instead chase bigger profits and an even higher stock price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no different in the workplace culture. Senior colleagues bullied and screamed at young women, causing them to cry at their desks. At an all-hands meeting, my boss said, “Now you Asians come to the microphone too. I know you don’t like to ask questions.” At a different all-hands meeting, the entire policy team was separated into various rooms and told to participate in a “diversity exercise” that placed me in a group labeled “homos” while participants shouted out stereotypes such as “effeminate” and “promiscuous.” Colleagues of color were forced to join groups called “Asians” and “Brown people” in other rooms nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these cases, I brought these issues to HR and senior executives and was assured the problems would be handled. Yet in each case, there was no follow up to address the concerns — until the day I was accidentally copied on an email from a senior HR director. In the email, the HR director told a colleague that I seemed to raise concerns like these a lot, and instructed her to “do some digging” on me instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, despite being rated and widely known as one of the best people managers at the company, despite 11 years of glowing performance reviews and near-perfect scores on Google’s 360-performance evaluations, and despite being a member of the elite Foundation Program reserved for Google’s “most critical talent” who are “key to Google’s current and future success,” I was told there was no longer a job for me as a result of a “reorganization,” despite 90 positions on the policy team being vacant at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hired counsel, Google assured me that there had been a misunderstanding, and I was offered a small role in exchange for my acquiescence and silence. But for me, the choice was as clear as the situation. I left. Standing up for women, for the LGBTQ community, for colleagues of color, and for human rights — had cost me my career. To me, no additional evidence was needed that “Don’t be evil” was no longer a true reflection of the company’s values; it was now nothing more than just another corporate marketing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asked many times since returning home, “What changed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the people. The founders and visionaries behind the company, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, disengaged and left management in the hands of new senior executives. A new CEO was hired to lead Google Cloud and a new CFO was hired from Wall Street, and beating earnings expectations every quarter became the key priority. Every year, thousands of new employees join the company, overwhelming everyone who fought to preserve the company’s original values and culture. When I joined the company there were under 10,000 Googlers and by the time I left, there were over 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the products. Some will say that Google was always a bad corporate actor, with less than transparent privacy practices. But there is a significant difference between serving ads based on a Google search and working with the Chinese government on artificial intelligence or hosting the applications of the Saudi government, including Absher, an application that allows men to track and control the movement of their female family members. Executives hell-bent on capturing cloud computing revenue from Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon had little patience for those of us arguing for some form of principled debate before agreeing to host the applications and data of any client willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the important question is what does it mean when one of America’s marque’ companies changes so dramatically. Is it the inevitable outcome of a corporate culture that rewards growth and profits over social impact and responsibility? Is it in some way related to the corruption that has gripped our federal government? Is this part of the global trend toward “strong man” leaders who are coming to power around the globe, where questions of “right” and “wrong” are ignored in favor of self-interest and self-dealing? Finally, what are the implications for all of us when that once-great American company controls so much data about billions of users across the globe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the causes and the implications are worth debating, I am certain of the appropriate response. No longer can massive tech companies like Google be permitted to operate relatively free from government oversight. As soon as Google executives were asked by Congress about Project Dragonfly and Google’s commitment to free expression and human rights, they assured Congress that the project was exploratory and it was subsequently shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of these companies in our daily lives, from how we run our elections to how we entertain and educate our children, is just too great to leave in the hands of executives who are accountable only to their controlling shareholders who — in the case of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Snap — happen to be fellow company insiders and founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after leaving Google, I returned home to Maine. It’s where I was born and raised, and where I was taught basic values like the importance of working hard, standing up for what is right, and speaking the truth. Sharing my story with my neighbors and my family has helped me understand why I was so often in conflict with the company’s leaders as Google changed. There are many people here in Maine and throughout the country who live by the credo “Don’t be evil.” We may not use that language, and we don’t have billion dollar marketing budgets to convince the world of our goodness. But, we live by those words every day, and we expect our government and our corporations to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>VVVVVV’s source code is now public, 10 year anniversary jam happening now</title>
<link>http://distractionware.com/blog/2020/01/vvvvvv-is-now-open-source/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://distractionware.com/blog/2020/01/vvvvvv-is-now-open-source/</guid>
<description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ending10year.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Today is the 10th anniversary of VVVVVV’s release!
&lt;p&gt;Or possibly tomorrow is, depending on who you ask – technically, the game first went live at 3am GMT on the 11th January 2010, after a very, very long day of fixing every last bug I could, &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2010/01/conundrum/&quot;&gt;making last minute builds&lt;/a&gt;, and trying to slowly upload everything on an extremely unreliable internet connection that kept cutting out. But I’ve always gone by “&lt;em&gt;it’s not tomorrow until you wake up&lt;/em&gt;” rules, so I still think of January the 10th as the real launch day &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gosh, ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VVVVVV is such an important game to me, I barely even know where to start. I wanted to do something special to mark the occasion: so, as of today, I’m releasing the game’s source code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/vvvvvv&quot;&gt;[VVVVVV Source Code on github]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repo contains two versions – the desktop version, &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2011/07/vvvvvv-version-2-0-launches-in-the-new-humble-indie-bundle/&quot;&gt;ported to C++ by Simon Roth in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2014/03/wanted-coder-for-vvvvvv-maintenance/&quot;&gt;updated and maintained by Ethan Lee&lt;/a&gt; – and the mobile version, written in Actionscript for Adobe AIR, based on the original v1.0 flash version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanna give a big big thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flibitijibibo.com/&quot;&gt;Ethan Lee&lt;/a&gt;, who helped a lot to prepare for this, including getting the repo ready for the public, and organising the reveal on AGDQ (hi speedrunners!)! Thanks Ethan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/nearelephant.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quick overview of the source code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think a fair question to ask here is: &lt;em&gt;“What’s interesting about the VVVVVV source code?”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think even a peek of the source code will quickly reveal that VVVVVV is not a technically sophisticated game! Even by the standards of self taught indie devs, it’s kind of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some possibly interesting notes/explanations of why things are they way they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s a lot of weird stuff in the C++ version that only really makes sense when you remember that this was made in flash first, and directly ported, warts and all. For example, maybe my worst programming habit is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV/blob/master/desktop_version/src/Map.h#L95&quot;&gt;declaring temporary variables like i, j and k as members of each class&lt;/a&gt;, so that I didn’t have to declare them inside functions (which is annoying to do in flash for boring reasons). This led to some &lt;strong&gt;nasty&lt;/strong&gt; and difficult to track down bugs, to say the least. In entity collision in particular, several functions will share the same &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; variable. Infinite loops are possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re looking for the game’s text, that’s mainly (but not entirely) in the &lt;em&gt;Scripts.cpp&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;TerminalScripts.cpp&lt;/em&gt; classes. These functions basically load data into a very simple script parser that controls cutscene logic. Fun fact: modders reverse engineered this “&lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=1089.0&quot;&gt;internal scripting&lt;/a&gt;” years later to do amazing things with custom levels that I didn’t even know were possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhere along the road, I picked up that it was a good habit to separate your code into input, logic and render, and boy did I take that to heart. Most of the critical game code is in three files – &lt;em&gt;input.ccp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;logic.cpp&lt;/em&gt;, and the incorrectly named &lt;em&gt;titlerender.cpp&lt;/em&gt;. Every state in the game is packed into these three files, under functions called things like “&lt;em&gt;teleporterrender&lt;/em&gt;” and “&lt;em&gt;towerlogic&lt;/em&gt;“. There’s a lot of copy and pasting going on here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the actual &lt;em&gt;levels&lt;/em&gt; in the game are hardcoded in huge arrays that I generated with my own map editor, which exports the levels in source code that I could read in. This is just kind of how it worked when making a flash game in 2009 – accessing external data assets is hard to do, so it just made sense at the time to compile that into the game instead. All the really big files (like Spacestation2.cpp, Finalclass.cpp and so on) were made this way. I’ve uploaded the code for the editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/9wqvBGuD&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for completeness, but it’s not really useable anymore to be honest (it requires Allegro and Mingw to compile). I made a similar tool for rearranging the final level layouts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I was making this, I didn’t really understand how static classes worked, or why they were a good idea. I think I read somewhere that static classes and global variables were BAD in flash, so I tried to avoid using them at all ever. The result? Virtually every function in the game is passing around the following arguments: &lt;em&gt;“Graphics&amp;amp; dwgfx, Game&amp;amp; game, mapclass&amp;amp; map, entityclass&amp;amp; obj, UtilityClass&amp;amp; help”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VVVVVV basically has no temporary objects, and it fills all of its entity arrays (and most of its other data arrays) with hundreds of blank entries when the game is first initialised. It does this because I read somewhere that deleting objects in flash causes weird hiccups as the garbage collector takes over and slows things down, which is actually sort of true. I was still doing this weird thing in new projects until very recently – I finally broke the habit in Dicey Dungeons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One more: as well as the cutscene parser, I had another way to control game logic as you were playing – a monolithic state machine, which had gotten completely out of control by the end of the project! You can find it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV/blob/f7c0321b715ceed8e87eba2ca507ad2dc28a428d/desktop_version/src/Game.cpp#L612&quot;&gt;Game::updatestate&lt;/a&gt;, and I kinda recommend checking this out even if you don’t read anything else! This controls things like triggering the start of more complicated cutscenes, where teleporters send you, the timing of the level completion animation, and other miscellaneous things that I just wanted to kludge in quickly. The states are numbered, and it counts all the way up to 4099, with gaps. When I was developing the game, I kept a notepad nearby with the important numbers written down – 1,000 triggers the collection of a shiny trinket, 3,040 triggers one particular level completion, 3,500 triggers the ending. This dumb system is the underlying cause of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUA7i2fkGt8&quot;&gt;this amazing 50.2 second any% speedrun&lt;/a&gt; of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dunno, what can I say? I was young and more interested in getting something on the screen than implementing it properly. Maybe the best thing about VVVVVV’s source code is that is stands as proof of what you can hack together even if you’re not much of a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back through it myself all these years later, I find it really funny how much of it is basically just the same parts copy and pasted over and over, with the values changed. This basically makes it impossible to read and maintain ten years later, but back when I was in the thick of it, it made it really fast to iterate and add new things. I’ve gained better habits over the past decade, and I’m definitely a better programmer now – but it does seem to take me longer to do things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise Birthday Party!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I was getting ready to post all this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corneaga&quot;&gt;Sergio Cornaga&lt;/a&gt; announced a 10th anniversary game jam for VVVVVV over on glorious trainwrecks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/11759&quot;&gt;VVVVVV’s 10th birthday eVVVVVVent!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; excited about this, haha – and I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; glorious trainwrecks, which hosted the regular Klik of the Month jams that I did regularly around the time I was making VVVVVV. This feels like a perfect home for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really, really excited to see what people come up with – once the jam ends, I’ll do a big round up post here on this blog, in the style of the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/category/vvvvvv-levels/&quot;&gt;VVVVVV player level posts&lt;/a&gt; I used to write &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before I released the game’s source code the game, I made the tools to make and play VVVVVV levels available for free in the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2014/06/outer-space/&quot;&gt;Make and Play&lt;/a&gt;” edition back in 2014! &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2014/06/outer-space/&quot;&gt;You can download that from here!&lt;/a&gt; If you’re interested in making levels in the VVVVVV editor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/forum/index.php?topic=322.0&quot;&gt;this thread is a good place to start&lt;/a&gt;! Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sad_Elephant_room_in_the_game_vvvvvv.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mushy stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhhhh so I’ve talked about how I feel about VVVVVV a little before – just before the first anniversary, I posted about how things were going for me when the game first came out, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2011/01/stop-and-reflect/&quot;&gt;how its success changed my life&lt;/a&gt;. Then on its firth anniversary, I posted about &lt;a href=&quot;http://distractionware.com/blog/2015/01/forgot-and-never-brought-to-mind/&quot;&gt;how VVVVVV felt like a once in a lifetime project&lt;/a&gt; – that nothing before or after could come close to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade on, I still feel the same way. I’m incredibly proud of VVVVVV, and grateful for everything. I want to thank everyone who helped me along the way – Magnus for his incredible soundtrack, Ethan and Simon for all their work to bring the game to more people, Bennett for naming the rooms, Stephen for helping me get that mac build out late in launch day. This game is special to me – thank you to everyone who played it and supported me over the past ten years. It’s meant so much. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Did you ever need to run a piece of C# code on Windows 3.11?</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;6/7 Glad you asked. In 1992 Microsoft shipped an addition to Windows 3.11 called Win32s. This let people run *some* 32-bit apps on the otherwise 16-bit system. Not all Win32 APIs were available, but surprisingly many apps still worked with it. Like Office 95.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Unison language</title>
<link>https://www.unisonweb.org/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.unisonweb.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Unison’s core idea is that code is immutable and identified by its content. This lets us reimagine many aspects of how a programming language works. We simplify codebase management — Unison has no builds, no dependency conflicts, and renaming things is trivial. The same core idea forms the basis for a runtime that robustly supports dynamic code deployment, allowing a single Unison program to describe entire elastic distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though a lot of the work on Unison is still experimental and ongoing, we’re sharing an early alpha release of the language for you to test out. We’ll make a more finished release generally available soon. In the meantime, anyone is welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unisonweb.org/docs&quot;&gt;help with alpha testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Benchmarking DNS response times of TLDs</title>
<link>https://bunnycdn.com/blog/is-your-fancy-new-domain-hurting-your-performance-gtld-benchmark/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bunnycdn.com/blog/is-your-fancy-new-domain-hurting-your-performance-gtld-benchmark/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As a CDN we're constantly trying to squeeze every last millisecond of load time. We recently had a user come to us with a list of performance tests on their site, reporting DNS responses often taking over 150 ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a couple of checks, it turned out that the problem actually lied with the .xyz top-level domain itself which took over 100 ms just to resolve the nameserver data for their domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this came as a bit of a surprise, similar issues in the past were actually the reason why we switched from using a .zone domain to .net for our shared domain. With so many new top-level domains recently popping up, we decided to check how well they actually performed and how much of an actual impact they can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-wait-how-can-the-domain-itself-increase-the-load-time&quot;&gt;But wait, how can the domain itself increase the load time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain, we first need to look deeper into how DNS functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When resolving a domain such as test.xyz, the DNS resolver will first need to contact the top-level DNS servers from .xyz to get the list of nameservers responsible for the domain. While this might be already cached by the resolver such as your ISP, it might not always be the case depending on the popularity of your domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only once the resolver has this information, it can actually query the received nameservers to get the final address for test.xyz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if the DNS for the top-level domain is slow, it can actually delay the DNS resolution for the domain itself and in a very unlikely worst case scenario even cause an outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;benchmarking-time&quot;&gt;Benchmarking Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, benchmarking the performance is fairly easy. Since we run a global network, it allowed us to monitor the performance worldwide from over 50 locations and networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each top-level domain, our system picked a random nameserver published for each of the top-level domains and queried a random domain name that we picked for it. We then grouped the results by region and logged the data every 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested 42 of some of the most popular top-level domains and aggregated the results into a global median average and a 85 percentile aggregation (meaning 15% of the responses were slower than this time). The real world results might vary slightly since all of these tests were performed from our network only, but they should offer a good general overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, some of the results were quite surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunnycdn.com/blog/content/images/2019/12/gtld-dns-resolution-time-6.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest shockers were the .info and .org domains that showed really poor performance especially in the 85 percentile range, despite being one of the oldest and well established top-level domains with millions of registered domains each. After some further investigation it appears 4 out of 6 of their nameservers are performing extremely poorly which is the reason for the poor results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .net and .com were very slightly slower than we expected in Europe and North America, but otherwise offer great and stable performance across all regions as we can see in the global median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing to see was the performance for .co, .biz and .in domains that ended up way ahead of the rest. The .net and .com have much larger networks, but these might be a very interesting choice if you're looking to get the absolute maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our suspicions about some of the cool and shiny new domains that have begun popping up recently were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were delighted to see some of the new top-level domains performing really well such as the .live, .email, .news, etc. which are all run by the same company, we also saw a very large performance drop in many other cases. Some of the domains performed multiple times slower than average and showed average query times well over 100 ms. Many of them also had a big performance drop-off in regions outside of Europe and North America, making the issue even worse there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested 42 of some of the most popular top-level domains out of 600+ available, so we could assume many of those might not perform much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-conclusion&quot;&gt;The Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, does this mean you should immediately cancel all of your domains and go for a .co or .biz domain to increase performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most definitely not. In many cases, the DNS responses are heavily cached and especially for very popular websites the resolvers might not need to hit the top-level nameservers much at all. Choosing a domain that fits your brand is in most cases much more important than gaining those extra 50 milliseconds of load time for the first page load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are trying to squeeze absolutely every last bit of performance and ensure great reliability in a system where every last millisecond matters, then you might want to think twice before choosing your domain. The differences aren't huge, but if you're aiming to hit that one second loading time, then things do add up, in some cases even as much as 200 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is your fancy new domain hurting your performance? It actually might be, but probably not enough to worry about that too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article was updated on 20th of December with more domains and a median + 85 percentile aggregation instead of averaging the results for more accurate representation of the performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Towards a Rust Foundation</title>
<link>http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2020/01/09/towards-a-rust-foundation/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2020/01/09/towards-a-rust-foundation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/12/02/rust-2020/&quot;&gt;my #rust2020 blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned rather off-handedly that I think the time has come for us to talk about forming a Rust foundation. I wanted to come back to this topic and talk in more detail about what I think a Rust foundation might look like. And, since I don’t claim to have the final answer to that question by any means, I’d also like to talk about &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; I think we should have this conversation going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hat-tip&quot;&gt;Hat tip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, I want to say that most of the ideas in this post arose from conversations with others. In particular, Florian Gilcher, Ryan Levick, Josh Triplett, Ashley Williams, and I have been chatting pretty reguarly, and this blog post generally reflects the consensus that we seemed to be arriving at (though perhaps they will correct me). Thanks also to Yehuda Katz and Till Schneidereit for lots of detailed discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-we-want-a-rust-foundation&quot;&gt;Why do we want a Rust foundation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is in many ways the most important question for us to answer: what is it that we hope to achieve by creating a Rust foundation, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, there are two key goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;to help clarify Rust’s status as an independent project, and thus encourage investment from more companies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to alleviate some practical problems caused by Rust not having a “legal entity” nor a dedicated bank account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also some anti-goals. Most notably:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the foundation should not replace the existing Rust teams as a decision-making apparatus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of the foundation is to complement the teams and to help us in achieving our goals. It is not to set the goals themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-small-and-iterate&quot;&gt;Start small and iterate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that I’ve outlined a fairly narrow role for the foundation. This is no accident. When designing a foundation, just as when designing many other things, I think it makes sense for us to move carefully, a step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should try to address immediate problems that we are facing and then give those changes some time to “sink in”. We should also take time to experiment with some of the various funding possibilities that are out there (some of which I’ll discuss later on). Once we’ve had some more experience, it should be easier for us to see which next steps make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason to start small is being able to move more quickly. I’d like to see us setup a foundation like the one I am discussing as soon as this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;goal-1-clarifying-rusts-status-as-an-independent-project&quot;&gt;Goal #1: Clarifying Rust’s status as an independent project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s talk a bit more about the two goals that I set forth for a Rust foundation. The first was to clarify Rust’s status as an independent project. In some sense, this is nothing new. Mozilla has from the get-go attempted to create an independent governance structure and to solicit involvement from other companies, because we know this makes Rust a better language for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is sometimes a lingering perception that Mozilla “owns” Rust, which can discourage companies from getting invested, or create the perception that there is no need to support Rust since Mozilla is footing the bill. Establishing a foundation will make official what has been true in practice for a long time: that Rust is an independent project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also heard a few times from companies, large and small, who would like to support Rust financially, but right now there is no clear way to do that. Creating a foundation creates a place where that support can be directed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mozilla-wants-to-support-rust-just-not-alone&quot;&gt;Mozilla wants to support Rust… just not alone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, establishing a Rust foundation doesn’t mean that Mozilla plans to step back. After all, Mozilla has a lot riding on Rust, and Rust is playing an increasingly important role in how Mozilla builds our products. What we really want is a scenario where other companies join Mozilla in supporting Rust, letting us do much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, this has already started to happen. For example, just this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/update-on-the-ci-investigation/10056/9?u=nikomatsakis&quot;&gt;Microsoft started sponsoring Rust’s CI costs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-sponsorship-of-the-rust-project/&quot;&gt;Amazon is paying Rust’s S3 bills&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we recently added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/sponsors&quot;&gt;corporate sponsors&lt;/a&gt; page to the Rust web site to acknowledge the many companies that are starting to support Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;goal-2-alleviating-some-practical-difficulties&quot;&gt;Goal #2: Alleviating some practical difficulties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Rust project has its own governance system, it has never had its own distinct legal entity. That role has always been played by Mozilla. For example, Mozilla owns the Rust trademarks, and Mozilla is the legal operator for services like crates.io. This means that Mozilla is (in turn) responsible for ensuring that DMCA requests against those services are properly managed and so forth. For a long time, this arrangement worked out quite well for Rust. Mozilla Legal, for example, provided excellent help in drafting Rust’s trademark agreements and coached us through how to handle DMCA takedown requests (which thankfully have arisen quite infrequently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, though, the Rust project has started to hit the limits of what Mozilla can reasonably support. One common example that arises is the need to have some entity that can legally sign contracts “for the Rust project”. For example, we wished recently to sign up for Github’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/partnerships/token-scanning/&quot;&gt;Token Scanning&lt;/a&gt; program, but we weren’t able to figure out who ought to sign the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is token scanning by itself a burning problem? No. We could probably work out a solution for it, and for other similar cases that have arisen, such as deciding who should sign Rust binaries. But it might be a sign that it is time for the Rust project to have its own legal entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;another-practical-difficulty-rust-has-no-bank-account&quot;&gt;Another practical difficulty: Rust has no bank account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of a “practical difficulty” that we’ve encountered is that Rust has no bank account. This makes it harder for us to arrange for joint sponsorship and support of events and other programs that the Rust program would like to run. The most recent example is the Rust All Hands. Whereas in the past Mozilla has paid for the venue, catering, and much of the airfare by itself, this year we are trying to “share the load” and have multiple companies provide sponsorship. However, this requires a bank account to collect and pool funds. We have solved the problem for this year, but it would be easier if the Rust organization had a bank account of its own. I imagine we would also make use of a bank account to fund other sorts of programs, such as Increasing Rust’s Reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-paying-people-and-contracting&quot;&gt;On paying people and contracting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where I think we should move slowly is on the topic of employing people and hiring contractors. As a practical matter, the foundation is probably going to want to employ some people. For example, I suspect we need an “operations manager” to help us keep the wheels turning (this is already a challenge for the core team, and it’s only going to get worse as the project grows). We may also want to do some limited amount of contracting for specific purposes (e.g., to pay for someone to run a program like Increasing Rust’s Reach, or to help do data crunching on the Rust survey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rust-foundation-should-not-hire-developers-at-least-to-start&quot;&gt;The Rust foundation should not hire developers, at least to start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think the Rust foundation should do anything like hiring full-time developers, at least not to start. I would also avoid trying to manage larger contracts to hack on rustc. There are a few reasons for this, but the biggest one is simply that it is &lt;strong&gt;expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Funding that amount of work will require a significant budget, which will require significant fund-raising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing a large budget, as well as employees, will also require more superstructure. If we hire developers, who decides what they should work on? Who decides when it’s time to hire? Who decides when it’s time to &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit difficult: on the one hand, I think there is a strong need for more people to get paid for their work on Rust. On the other hand, I am not sure a foundation is the right institution to be paying them; even if it were, it seems clear that we don’t have enough experience to know how to answer the sorts of difficult questions that will arise as a result. Therefore, I think it makes sense to fall back on the approach to “start small and iterate” here. Let’s create a foundation with a limited scope and see what difference it makes before we make any further decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-other-things-the-foundation-wouldnt-do&quot;&gt;Some other things the foundation wouldn’t do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are a variety of other things that a hypothetical foundation should not do, at least not to start. For example, I think the foundation should not pay for local meetups nor sponsor Rust conferences. Why? Well, for one thing, it’ll be hard for us to come up with criteria on when to supply funds and when not to. For another, both meetups and conferences I think will do best if they can forge strong relationships with companies directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even if there are things that the Rust foundation wouldn’t fund or do directly, I think it makes a lot of sense to collect a list of the kinds of things it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; do. If nothing else, we can try to offer suggestions for where to find funding or obtain support, or perhaps offer some lightweight “match-making” role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-should-strive-to-have-many-kinds-of-rust-sponsorship&quot;&gt;We should strive to have many kinds of Rust sponsorship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am nervous about a situation in which a Rust Foundation comes to have a kind of “monopoly” on supporting the Rust project or Rust-flavored events. I think it’d be great if we can encourage a wider variety of setups. First and foremost, I’d like to see more companies that use Rust hiring people whose job description is to support the Rust project itself (at least in part). But I think it could also work to create “trade associations” where multiple companies pool funds to hire Rust developers. If nothing else, it is worth experimenting with these sorts of setups to help gain experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-should-create-a-project-group-to-figure-this-out&quot;&gt;We should create a “project group” to figure this out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a foundation is a complex task. In this blog post, I’ve just tried to sketch the “high-level view” of what responsiblities I think a foundation might take on and why (and which I think we should avoid or defer). But I left out a lot of interesting details: for example, should the Foundation be a 501(c)(3) (a non-profit, in other words) or not? Should we join an umbrella organization and – if so – which one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional way that the Rust project makes decisions, of course, is through RFCs, and I think that a decision to create a foundation should be no exception. In fact, I do plan to open an RFC about creating a foundation soon. However, I &lt;strong&gt;don’t&lt;/strong&gt; expect this RFC to try to spell out all the details of how a foundation would work. Rather, I plan to propose creating a &lt;strong&gt;project group&lt;/strong&gt; with the goal of answering those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I think the core team should select some set of folks who will explore the best design for a foundation. Along the way, we’ll keep the community updated with the latest ideas and take feedback, and – in the end – we’ll submit an RFC (or perhaps a series of RFCs) with a final plan for the core team to approve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, well, enough about what I think. I’m very curious (and a bit scared, I won’t lie) to hear what people think about the contents of this post. To collect feedback, I’ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/blog-post-towards-a-rust-foundation/11601&quot;&gt;thread on internals&lt;/a&gt;. As ever, I’ll read all the responses, and I’ll do my best to respond where I can. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
