<title>Four-day week trial: study finds lower stress but no cut in output</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/19/four-day-week-trial-study-finds-lower-stress-but-no-cut-in-output</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/feb/19/four-day-week-trial-study-finds-lower-stress-but-no-cut-in-output</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Analysis of one of the biggest trials yet of the four-day working week has revealed no fall in output, decreases in stress and increased staff engagement, fuelling hopes that a better work-life-balance for millions could finally be in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perpetual Guardian, a New Zealand financial services company, switched its 240 staff from a five-day week to a four-day week last November and maintained their pay. Productivity increased in the four days they worked so there was no drop in the total amount of work done, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.4dayweek.co.nz/access-white-paper&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;a study of the trial&lt;/a&gt; released on Tuesday has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial was monitored by academics at the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology. Among the Perpetual Guardian staff they found scores given by workers about leadership, stimulation, empowerment and commitment all increased compared with a 2017 survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Andrew Barnes, managing director of Perpetual Guardian.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd212a9bee7a25bab4f2746ee1845f7057a84a1b/470_454_2098_2623/master/2098.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=0356362423b20b0eb7fd6d5bb10dc0ac&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest increases were in commitment and empowerment. Staff stress levels were down from 45% to 38%. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-life-balance&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Work-life balance&lt;/a&gt; scores increased from 54% to 78%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been treated like adults and I think as a result everyone is behaving like adults,” said Tammy Barker, a branch manager who was part of the trial that cut the working week from from 37.5 hours to 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight-week experiment was closely watched by employers and policymakers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jan/18/tgi-thursday-major-uk-employer-mulls-four-day-week&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Wellcome Trust science funding body is considering switching&lt;/a&gt; its 800 head office staff to a four-day week, and Perpetual Guardian has been inundated with more than 350 requests for information about the trial from 28 countries. Most have come from organisations in the UK, followed by Australia, the US and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labour party has commissioned a study of the possibilities of a four-day week. However, early research points to the complexity of achieving productivity gains in major industries like retail, where being present is a key part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, average working hours have been increasing since the financial crisis, and questions have been raised about how far people working in frontline occupations such as nursing or the police could cut their hours without reducing the public service they provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller companies experimenting with the four-day week have found performance has been better in the first few weeks as excitement about the project took hold, before falling slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The biggest concern from an employer point of view is ensuring that the full-time introduction of the policy doesn’t lead to complacency, with the risk that people’s productivity will slip back,” Barker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To guard against this happening we’ve spent a lot of time making sure every person in every team has their own plan as to how they’re going to maintain and even improve their productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Shopper in Karangahape in Auckland city, New Zealand&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9df379c2429b02fe1399ecd4e76c9a8c55d9786/0_154_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=1b470e18b567600f6b63728290b1b0ce&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she said that she had personally found that working less increased her focus on tasks, and she was no longer jumping from one thing to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was actually finishing projects before moving on to the next one, and by the end of the day found I was accomplishing more than trying to multitask everything,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did find that my productivity increased purely by being more aware of my work processes and thinking about how I was doing things and why I was doing them. At the same time, I didn’t feel any more stressed at work probably because I was really focussing on the tasks at hand and because I had the extra day off to compensate for the increased work rate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People used the additional day off for some of the same leisure activity they would have done at the weekend, such as golf or watching Netflix, but new activities emerged too, according to Jarrod Haar, professor of human resource management at the Auckland University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These included “spending time with parents”, “spending much-needed time studying”, and “cleaning the house on a Wednesday and then having the weekend free”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Managers reported their teams were more creative after the trial,” he said. “It involved them finding solutions to doing their work in four days, so this reflected well. Importantly, they rated their teams as giving better customer service – they were more engaging and focussed when clients and customers called.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said significantly lower job stress and burnout was reported, with work-life balance levels achieving record highs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beyond wellbeing, employees reported their teams were stronger and functioned better together, more satisfied with their jobs, more engaged and they felt their work had greater meaning,” he said. “They also reported being more committed to the organisation and less likely to look elsewhere for a job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perpetual Guardian’s founder and chief executive, Andrew Barnes, said: “Having implemented the four-day week on an opt-in basis we are continuing to identify ways to raise productivity and improve engagement, wellbeing and job satisfaction within this groundbreaking model of flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple’s Latest Macs Have a Serious Audio Glitching Bug</title>
<link>http://cdm.link/2019/02/apple-2018-glitch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://cdm.link/2019/02/apple-2018-glitch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple has a serious, apparently unresolved bug that causes issues with all audio performance with external devices across all its latest Macs, thanks to the company’s own software and custom security chip.&lt;span id=&quot;more-91277&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following bug reports online, the impacted machines are all the newest computers – those with Apple’s own T2 security chip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;iMac Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac mini models introduced in 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook Air models introduced in 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook Pro models introduced in 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The T2 in Apple’s words “is Apple’s second-generation, custom silicon for Mac. By redesigning and integrating several controllers found in other Mac computers—such as the System Management Controller, image signal processor, audio controller, and SSD controller—the T2 chip delivers new capabilities to your Mac.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, it appears that this new chip has introduced glitches on a wide variety of external audio hardware from across the pro audio industry, thanks to a bug in Apple’s software. Issues with the way the new chip synchronizes timing causes dropouts and glitches in the audio stream. (It seems basically all USB 2.0 audio interfaces will be impacted. This of course unfortunately leads users to blame their interface manufacturer, but the fault lies with Apple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching off “Set date and time automatically” in System Preferences will reduce, but not resolve the issue. &lt;a href=&quot;%E2%80%9Chttp://nebulae.com%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;Nebulae&lt;/a&gt; aka Abid Hussain, an Apple Certified trainer, writes in comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unchecking the time sync only reduces the dropouts. You need to also uncheck the location sync in the Time Zone tab, but even then you’re only reducing the dropouts. Any time the T2 chip tries to sync, it will overload the USB2.0 bus, causing dropouts. There is no way any musician should go on stage with a 2018 [Mac] and a USB2.0 audio interface directly connected to it. The only solutions are 1) Get a Thunderbolt or USB3.0 audio interface, or 2) Use a Certified Thunderbolt 3 powered hub (not a bus-powered or cheap non-certified hub) – Cable Matters has a solution for $169 on Amazon, but most of those hubs are at least $200-300. Using a certified TB3 hub creates a separate external USB2.0 hub in which you can run your USB2.0 audio interface. The cheap hubs do not work because they don’t work on TB3, and therefore they don’t create their own separate USB bus, which means you’re going to get dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To clarify:&lt;/strong&gt; all T2-based Macs, that is all Mac models from the 2018 generation, are evidently unusable with USB 2.0 audio interfaces, irrespective of vendor. Audio interfaces using FireWire or Thunderbolt are reportedly unaffected by this particular bug, but USB 2.0 is for the moment the most popular bus for audio devices, so nearly all owners of the new machines are encountering the issue. (There are also some reports that USB3 devices are unaffected, but I can’t confirm that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This of course has led some users to simply buy a new Thunderbolt 3 audio interface. But this situation is unacceptable – plenty of standard, inexpensive PCs have no such issues with Thunderbolt and USB audio hardware. Apple has shipped their entire computer line with buggy firmware that renders those machines unusable for the majority of people working with sound (so music, video, and audio production), and have lagged in finding a solution for months after shipping these expensive machines. Not only that, but is anyone clear on what problem the T2 security chip even solves? Apple now loves crowing about its “custom silicon” often without even explaining to us why anyone needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for now that’s the set of choices, until Apple ships a comprehensive, tested fix:&lt;br/&gt;1. Mac users on older machines should postpone upgrading.&lt;br/&gt;2. Mac users in the market purchasing a new machine right now should consider a comparable Windows machine.&lt;br/&gt;3. Users stuck with these models should use a Thunderbolt 3 audio interface, adapter, or hub, or attempt to return the computer in favor of an older Mac or new PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This represents another serious quality control fumble from Apple. The value proposition with Apple always been that the company’s control over its own hardware, software, and industrial engineering meant a more predictable product. But when Apple botches the quality of its own products and doesn’t test creative audio and video use cases, that value case quickly flips. You’re sacrificing choice and paying a higher price for a product that’s actually worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a cause for concern that here it appears Apple may have lacked a test regimen that includes, say, USB audio interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s recent Mac line have also come under fire for charging a premium price while sacrificing things users want (like NVIDIA graphics cards, affordable internal storage, or extra ports). And on the new thin MacBook and MacBook Pro lines, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2018/06/23/apple-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-broken-free-repair/&quot;&gt;keyboard reliability issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those mainstream PC vendors do now test with third-party pro audio hardware (I’ve talked to Razer about this, for instance). And that’s to say nothing of vendors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcaudiolabs.com/&quot;&gt;pcaudiolabs&lt;/a&gt; who custom-configure each machine for the actual DAWs. Apple clearly has the resources to do the same, and they make a DAW of their own (Logic Pro). This appears to be an issue they could possibly have reproduced and corrected before shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultofmac.com/595330/ipad-pro-bug-music-apps-stutter/&quot;&gt;2018 iPad Pro also suffered from audio issues&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be software related. This seems not to have any direct relation to the issue with the Mac line, but is further evidence of some quality control and testing issues involving real-time audio performance and Apple firmware and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do have one of these machines, let us know if you’ve been having trouble with this issue and if this workaround (hopefully) solves your problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 21 million people worldwide suffer from schizophrenia, a profound mental illness that interrupts thinking, language and perception. Quite a few schizophrenic people experience delusions and hear voices. Many of the disease’s symptoms stem from faulty communication between brain cells. And, for decades, scientists have searched for a cure in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now researchers say they’ve discovered that the way to heal schizophrenia might be through the gut. There’s an ecosystem of bacteria and microbes that live in our digestive tracts, known as the gut microbiome. And these may lead to some features of schizophrenia, an international team of scientists announced &lt;a href=&quot;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/2/eaau8317&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The discovery could revolutionize treatment options for schizophrenia.&lt;span id=&quot;more-31691&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We understand schizophrenia as a brain disease,” Ma-Ling Wong, a medical geneticist at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, who co-led the new research, said in a press briefing. “But maybe we need to re-examine this line of thinking and consider that maybe the gut has an important role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gut-Brain Connection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that the gut is connected to mental health has been gaining traction in recent years. And research is now pointing to a link between the gut microbiome and an array of mental health disorders including anxiety, memory and motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease. A separate study, published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0337-x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; connected missing gut microbes to depression. Those mounting associations extend to schizophrenia as well, where the mental illness often co-occurs with gastrointestinal disorders marked by atypical gut bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the connection, Wong and colleagues sequenced the genetic material in stool samples from patients with schizophrenia, as well as healthy individuals recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that patients with schizophrenia had less diverse gut microbiomes than patients without schizophrenia, the researchers report. The microbiomes from schizophrenic patients also harbored unique kinds of bacteria. They were so distinct, in fact, that the researchers were able to tell patients with schizophrenia apart from healthy controls based just on the bacteria in their guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;All-New Approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most intriguing evidence came when the researchers gave germ-free mice fecal transplants from the schizophrenic patients. They found that “the mice behaved in a way that is reminiscent of the behavior of people with schizophrenia,” said Julio Licinio, who co-led the new work with Wong, his research partner and spouse. Mice given fecal transplants from healthy controls behaved normally. “The brains of the animals given microbes from patients with schizophrenia also showed changes in glutamate, a neurotransmitter that is thought to be dysregulated in schizophrenia,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery shows how altering the gut can influence an animals behavior, and it also provides a new target for drug treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This would give us a completely new pathway toward treating schizophrenia,” Licinio said. “No treatments that we give today are based on a change of the microbes in the gut. So if you could show that would change behavior in a positive way, we would have a whole new way to approach schizophrenia.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why a Grape Turns into a Fireball in the Microwave</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/why-a-grape-turns-into-a-fireball-in-a-microwave/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/why-a-grape-turns-into-a-fireball-in-a-microwave/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;The internet is&lt;/span&gt; full of videos of thoughtful people setting things on fire. Here’s a perennial favorite: Cleave a grape in half, leaving a little skin connecting the two hemispheres. Blitz it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/microwaves/&quot;&gt;in the microwave&lt;/a&gt; for five seconds. For one glorious moment, the grape halves will produce a fireball unfit for domestic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicist Stephen Bosi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwTjsRt0Fzo&amp;amp;t=116s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried the experiment&lt;/a&gt; back in 2011 for the YouTube channel Veritasium, in the physics department’s break room at the University of Sydney. On camera, he and the show’s host whooped in the glow of the grape. “Who needs drugs?” Bosi yells in the video, as a particularly psychedelic plume erupts. Off-camera, they discovered they had burned the interior of the physics department microwave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;caption-component__credit&quot;&gt;Hamza Khattak&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;It’s a crowd pleaser, as long as you avoid melting your kitchen appliances. But it turns out, even after millions of YouTube views and probably tens of scorched microwaves, no one knew exactly why the fireball forms. Popular online explanations usually say that the grape halves act like an antenna, and they somehow direct microwaves onto the small bridge of skin to ignite the initial spark. But nobody had actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/tag/physics/&quot;&gt;done the math to prove it&lt;/a&gt;. After several summers of microwaving grape-shaped objects and simulating the microwaving of those objects—a trio of physicists in Canada may have finally figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The physicists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1818350116&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;point out that people&lt;/a&gt; have let themselves be distracted by the fireball: “exciting and memorable” but “of secondary interest,” they write in a paper that appears today in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. The fireball is merely a beautiful, hot blob of loose electrons and ions known as a plasma. The most interesting science is contained in the steps &lt;em&gt;leading up&lt;/em&gt; to the plasma, they say. The real question is how the grape got hot enough to produce the plasma in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;So they revved up their microwave, grape after grape. They made grape replicas out of plastic beads soaked in water. They figured out a way to microwave the grape and its replicas right to the brink of plasma formation, but never letting the sparks actually fly. They even replaced the door to their microwave with a more transparent mesh so they could film the grapes more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Their conclusions: The grape is less like an antenna and more like a trombone, though for microwaves instead of sound. When you play a trombone, you push vibrating air into it. The trombone will only sustain vibrations of a particular wavelength—the musical note you hear—depending on where you’ve positioned the slide. Only certain wavelengths, known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-do-you-levitate-things-with-sound/&quot;&gt;standing waves&lt;/a&gt;, fit perfectly inside the trombone. As vibrating air of various wavelengths enter the trombone, the standing waves add constructively, while other wavelengths cancel each other out. In other words, the trombone amplifies the standing waves and mutes all others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The grape, incidentally, is the perfect size for amplifying the microwaves that your kitchen machine radiates. The appliance pushes microwaves into the two grape halves, where the waves bounce around and add constructively to focus the energy to a spot on the skin. Both grape halves happen to focus the energy to the same tiny point. That intense energy jostles the atoms and molecules at that spot, heating them up so much that they can no longer hold onto their electrons, which turns them into a plasma—and boom, fireball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;A common misconception is that the microwave acts on the grape from the outside in, like frozen meat defrosting, says physicist Pablo Bianucci of Concordia University, who worked on grape simulations included in the paper. Instead, it’s important to think of the microwave interacting with the grape as a whole, with the wave entering the fruit and bouncing around its confines like an excited puppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;They also found that the shape of the two grape halves and the little bridge of skin connecting them is not important. You can make the fireball by microwaving two whole grapes sitting side by side, for example. And it doesn’t even need to be a grape. “Anything grape-sized will work, if it’s watery enough,” says physicist Hamza Khattak, a graduate student at McMaster University who did much of the microwaving. They demonstrated this point by making fireballs out of microwaved gooseberries, large blackberries, and even quail eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;But it wasn’t just snack time for these physicists. The work has more serious applications too, Bosi says. His experiments with grape balls of fire began and ended with the 2011 YouTube video, but his curiosity did not. “I’m impressed with the scientific depth of the paper,” wrote Bosi in an email. In particular, he notes that authors came up with mathematical rules for describing the grape hotspot. They could conceivably shrink these rules to a smaller scale, to create similar hotspots in nanoparticles, for example. Scientists use heated nanoparticles to make very precise sensors or to facilitate chemical reactions, says Bianucci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Still, the case isn’t completely closed. During all their microwaving, they noticed that two grapes placed side-by-side repeatedly bump into each other, back and forth. They don’t know why that happens, and they’ll be studying that next, says Bianucci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;For those studies, they’ll probably stick with the plastic grape replicas, rather than the fruit. “That's because they don’t go bad,” says Khattak. Maybe they could try raisins.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Harder programming questions do a worse job of predicting outcomes</title>
<link>https://triplebyte.com/blog/interview-questions-are-too-hard-and-too-short</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://triplebyte.com/blog/interview-questions-are-too-hard-and-too-short</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr Programming interview questions can feel unnecessarily difficult. Sometimes they actually are. And this isn't just because they make interviews excessively stressful. Our data shows that harder programming questions actually do a &lt;strong&gt;worse&lt;/strong&gt; job of predicting final outcomes than easier ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming under time pressure is difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; This is especially true during interviews. A coding exercise that would seem simple under normal circumstances somehow becomes a formidable challenge under the bright lights of an interview room. Stress hormones cloud your thinking during interviews (even though, sadly, neither fight nor flight is an effective response to a menacing programming problem). And it can almost feel like the questions are designed to be perversely difficult. I actually think this is more than just a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interview questions are designed to be hard.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the cost of hiring a bad engineer is so much higher than the cost of rejecting a good engineer, companies are incentivized to set a high bar. And for most companies that means asking hard questions. Intuitively this makes sense because harder questions seem like they should result in a more rigorous screening process. But intuition turns out to be a poor guide here. &lt;strong&gt;Our data shows that harder questions are actually less predictive than relatively easy ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard questions do filter out bad engineers, but they also filter out good engineers&lt;/strong&gt; (that is, they have a high false-negative rate). Easy questions, in contrast, produce fewer false-negatives but more false-positives (since more engineers get them right, including some bad ones). Balancing these two signals is the core problem you face when selecting the optimal difficulty level for interview questions. Companies—seeking to avoid false positives at all cost—tend to skew towards the harder end of this spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;whether or not a candidate answers a question correctly is not the only source of signal during an interview.&lt;/strong&gt; You can also evaluate their process by, for example, observing how long it takes them to finish, how clean their code is, and how much they struggle while finding a solution. Our analysis shows that this second source of signal (process) is almost as predictive as the first (correctness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there is an additional trade-off here.&lt;/strong&gt; The questions that carry the most process signal are significantly easier than the questions that carry the most correctness signal. The reason for this becomes clear when you distill process down to how much a candidate struggles while finding a solution (the aspect of process most directly related to question difficulty). If a question is hard enough to carry a strong correctness signal, then all candidates will struggle with it (even those who eventually answer it correctly). So struggle will carry no signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, questions that carry a strong process signal will be easy enough for most candidates to answer them correctly, thus having little to offer in terms of correctness signal. An optimally difficult question is one that balances process and correctness to extract the maximum signal from the combination of these two factors (which may not be the peak signal for either).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We interviewed thousands of engineers and scored their answers along multiple dimensions, including process and correctness, and compared these scores with later performance. And, after regression analysis (looking at both process and correctness signal) our data showed that the most predictive questions were actually much easier than we expected (and easier than the questions that many companies ask).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harder questions ultimately filter out too many qualified candidates to be optimal. So, if you want to make your hiring process more accurate, you should probably ask easier questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to state clearly, however, that this doesn't mean you should lower the bar and pass more people. &lt;strong&gt;Asking easier questions doesn't necessarily mean making your interviews easier.&lt;/strong&gt; The difficulty level of the questions you ask and where you set your decision-threshold are independent decisions. You can still implement an extremely rigorous hiring process by asking relatively easy questions and evaluating them demandingly. Our finding is simply that easier questions provide more signal. But what you do with that signal is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easier interview questions are also less stressful, which is an important advantage. Stress causes candidates to under-perform. But, on the other hand, when candidates are more comfortable, they perform their true best, which actually makes interviews more predictive. I think that interviewers tend to under-estimate the effects of stress on candidates while over-estimating their own abilities. When you're the one asking the questions, it's easy to forget how hard it is to get much real programming done in 30-60 minutes. To counter this bias, we've adopted a rule at Triplebyte stating that interviewers have to give candidates 3X as much time to answer a question as they think it would take to solve it themselves. Usually this works out to be the right amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easier questions are beneficial for another important reason. They allow you to fit more content into your interviews. This means you can use longer, multi-part problems which have compounding benefits in terms of prediction. You can ask questions that ramp up in difficulty over time, and these &lt;strong&gt;longer, real-world questions are more predictive than their shorter and harder cousins.&lt;sup id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog/interview-questions-are-too-hard-and-too-short#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is partly because longer questions serve as better proxies for real-life programming. Production programming involves working with a relatively large codebase over a long period of time, and longer questions just do a better job of approximating this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, longer questions allow you to offer hints when a candidate gets stuck. I think this is vital because even strong engineers can get tripped up at some point during a coding problem. Asking longer questions gives candidates the chance to recover from errors and show off their skills later on during an exercise. &lt;strong&gt;A single misstep shouldn't ruin an entire interview.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, being able to offer help makes interviews less stressful which, again, results in more accurate outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companies can get stuck in a vicious cycle when it comes to question difficulty.&lt;/strong&gt; They start out asking questions that are already too hard and too short, which leads them to make sub-optimal hiring decisions based off noisy signals. When they experience poor outcomes, they may attempt to correct by making their process even more rigorous (which generally means asking even harder questions). But this only makes their interviews less accurate. And so on. Both companies and candidates are hurt by this cycle. I see companies missing out on talent and candidates missing out on jobs—and everyone getting more stressed than they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope interviewers will embrace this finding. Not only can it make their work more accurate, but easier as well. It's much less time intensive to come up with straightforward, multi-step problems than perversely difficult short challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, here's our advice, if you actually want to make your interviews more accurate, you probably need to start asking easier programming questions. This doesn't mean lowering the bar. It just means getting a better signal so you can hire the right people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yet when the Berlin Wall fell, East Germans ditched their Vita-Cola for Coca-Cola. Poland’s Polo-Cockta and the Czech Kofola both faded away, only to be later revived out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/kofola&quot;&gt;of nostalgia&lt;/a&gt;. But in India, two underdog sodas that flourished during the country’s stint of economic isolation have remained solidly shelved next to Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Even after India’s pivot from socialism to a largely free market, Thums Up and Limca have thrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;But they weren’t always at the top of the fizzy hierarchy. After India gained independence from Britain in 1947, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ushered in a political dynasty that would oversee moderate socialist economic reforms. Pure Drinks Group introduced Coca-Cola to the newly-formed republic two years later. Pepsi followed, only to exit in 1962 due to lagging sales. Coca-Cola—and other multinational corporations—kept growing despite the Nehruvian government’s extensive regulations. Politicians were dismayed by Coca-Cola’s omnipresence from India’s bustling metropolitan centers to its rural villages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The end of Coke’s reign was sparked by political upheaval. By 1977, India was fresh off two years of the “Emergency.” Spurred by a wobbly economy and unrest, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s government suspended civil liberties, jailed rivals, and broke up protests. In early 1977, Gandhi was unseated in favor of the Janata Party, an alliance of different political groups. One member, the future industry minister George Fernandes, wanted to eject Coca-Cola from the country. He went into his reasoning later. “When I chucked out Coca-Cola in 1977, I made the point that 90 percent of India’s villages did not have safe drinking water, whereas Coke had reached every village,” the late Fernandes said in a 1992 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/world/a-revolution-transforms-india-socialism-s-out-free-market-in.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article,&lt;/a&gt; adding “Do we really need Coke? Do we need Pepsi?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;During Gandhi’s tenure as prime minister, Parliament passed a set of regulations that would trigger the chucking. The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of 1973 required many multinationals to hand over 60% of the equity in their local subsidiaries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/16/archives/ibm-to-leave-india-and-avoid-loss-of-control-disputes-with-other.html&quot;&gt;to Indian partners.&lt;/a&gt; Coca-Cola would have had to release its top-secret syrup recipe and IBM its computer codes in order to comply. Faced with an ultimatum from Fernandes, Coca-Cola—along with Mobil, Kodak, and 54 other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbesindia.com/article/independence-day-special/economic-milestone-exit-of-the-mncs-(1977)/38431/1&quot;&gt;companies—left&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;India was left with a huge void in the carbonated beverage aisle. Out of the mess sprang a cohort of local sodas to fill the Coke-shaped hole. The Mumbai-based Parle Group introduced Thums Up and RimZim, two Coca-Cola replacements, while their lemonade-like Limca and newly created Citra filled in for Sprite. Pure Drinks used its expansive distribution network to disseminate a new product, Campa Cola, which it deemed “The Great Indian Taste.” Double Seven, named after that volatile year of 1977, was the government-sanctioned substitute for Coke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The local brands met varied success. According to Samit Sinha, brand expert and managing partner at Alchemist Consulting, the already dominant lemon-lime flavor category blew up following Coke’s departure, which was good news for Limca. Limca’s success even contributed to that of Thums Up, since the Parle Group insisted that stores stock the cola if they wanted its citrus sibling. “Thums Up was the most distinct, being fizzier, spicier, and less sweet than the others,” says Sinha. Unlucky Double Seven fell out of favor two years later, along with the Janata Party government that devised it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Limca still has a lemony appeal&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-62969&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/62969/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Limca still has a lemony appeal &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jasleen_kaur/4368887093/&quot;&gt;jasleen_kaur/CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;But the days of only “Great Indian Taste” started to taper off. In the late 1980s, India began chipping away at its armor of economic isolation. After years of political rigmarole, Pepsi was let back in—with a few conditions. One was that it “Indianize” its name. The newly branded &lt;em&gt;Lehar&lt;/em&gt; Pepsi (Lehar means “wave” in Hindi) hit the market in 1990&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The Soviet Union—socialist India’s primary sponsor—collapsed a year later. Lacking support and seriously in debt, India was forced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/world/a-revolution-transforms-india-socialism-s-out-free-market-in.html&quot;&gt;fully embrace the free market&lt;/a&gt;. According to historian of South Asia and professor Benjamin Siegel, it’s not an exaggeration to say that liberalization transformed the country practically overnight. “It was a moment when you went from one state-run television channel to lots of television channels,” he explains. “You went from having very few consumer goods, including these sodas, to lots of things coming in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Amidst the commercial deluge, Pepsi and hometown champion Thums Up duked it out in a legendary brand war. Pepsi bashed Thums Up as tasting like medicine in its advertisements. Meanwhile, Thums Up’s new slogan “Taste the Thunder” cemented its identity as the edgier, more masculine soda choice. Thums Up’s thrill-seeking branding (complete with commercials featuring cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcdVRdPzm9U&quot;&gt;bungee-jumping actors&lt;/a&gt;) resonated with the main soda-drinking demographic: teenage boys. But it also appealed to consumers at large in a re-energized, post-liberalization India fizzing with possibility. It didn’t hurt that Thums Up and Old Monk whiskey, another beloved local brand, incidentally became the “Indian version of Jack Daniels and Coke,” Sinha adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Thums Up’s timely, evocative marketing not only allowed it to beat Pepsi, Sinha says, but also its local cola competition. “Thums Up’s local origins certainly did stir up some national pride against the foreign Pepsi,” Sinha says. “The opening up to the world helped Indians become more aware of their own culture, and thus arose an emotional urge to support deserving Indian brands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thums Up remains India's top cola today.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-62965&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/62965/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;Thums Up remains India’s top cola today. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/221581067&quot;&gt;Meena Kadri/CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Still, it seemed as though the daredevil soda might meet its end when Coca-Cola re-entered India in 1993 and bought Thums Up from Parle. The foreign giant quickly killed Citra, Gold Spot, and RimZim to make room for its own Sprite, Fanta and Coke. But the local sodas wouldn’t die. Even with an influx of new options, Indians kept drinking Thums Up and Limca. Their sustained popularity can be put down to specific regional tastes—the former’s pungent tingle is meant to pair well with spicy food, and the latter’s taste and distinctive cloudy look appeals to the national love for &lt;em&gt;nimbu paani,&lt;/em&gt; or lemonade. Coca-Cola, caught between competition with Pepsi on one side and Indian consumers on the other, decided to spare both local brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Despite a strong conviction by many that Coca-Cola neglects its &lt;em&gt;desi&lt;/em&gt;, or domestic, brands, today Thums Up rules the cola scene in India, only topped in the carbonated beverage arena by Sprite. Unlike most of the world, Pepsi comes in at third and Coke trails at fourth. They are followed closely by Limca, which is most popular with older demographics. Perhaps that last statistic best explains how these homegrown sodas have survived over 40 years of political and economic turbulence. It may not be so much the flavor of Thums Up or Limca that keeps them in demand, but what they evoke: comforting familiarity in the midst of an ever-changing nation.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Let us first consider the dynamics of the pendulum if it is driven in a particular simple way: a torque which does not vary with time: \begin{equation} ml^2 \ddot\theta + b\dot\theta + mgl \sin\theta = u_0. \end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
.
&lt;div data-type=&quot;example&quot; class=&quot;drake&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can experiment with this system in using&lt;/p&gt;
pendulum/torque_slider_demo.py
&lt;p&gt;(use the slider at the top to adjust the torque input).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are relatively simple differential equations, so if I give you $\theta(0)$ and $\dot\theta(0)$, then you should be able to integrate them to obtain $\theta(t)$... right? Although it is possible, integrating even the simplest case ($b = u = 0$) involves elliptic integrals of the first kind; there is relatively little intuition to be gained here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in stark contrast to the case of linear systems, where much of our understanding comes from being able to explicitly integrate the equations. For instance, for a simple linear system we have $$\dot{q} = a q \quad \rightarrow \quad q(t) = q(0) e^{at},$$ and we can immediately understand that the long-term behavior of the system is a (stable) decaying exponential if $a&amp;lt;0$, an (unstable) growing exponential if $a&amp;gt;0$, and that the system does nothing if $a=0$. Here we are with certainly one of the simplest nonlinear systems we can imagine, and we can't even solve this system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is not lost. If what we care about is the long-term behavior of the system, then there are a number of techniques we can apply. In this chapter, we will start by investigating graphical solution methods. These methods are described beautifully in a book by Steve StrogatzStrogatz94.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section data-type=&quot;sect2&quot; readability=&quot;126.69851632047&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start by studying a special case -- intuitively when $b\dot\theta \gg ml^2\ddot\theta$ -- which via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity&quot;&gt;dimensional analysis&lt;/a&gt; (using the natural frequency $\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}$ to match units) occurs when $b \sqrt\frac{l}{g} \gg ml^2$. This is the case of heavy damping, for instance if the pendulum was moving in molasses. In this case, the damping term dominates the acceleration term, and we have: $$ml^2 \ddot\theta + b\dot\theta \approx b\dot\theta = u_0 - mgl\sin\theta.$$ In other words, in the case of heavy damping, the system looks approximately first order. This is a general property of heavily damped systems, such as fluids at very low Reynolds number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to ignore one detail for a moment: the fact that $\theta$ wraps around on itself every $2\pi$. To be clear, let's write the system without the wrap-around as: \begin{equation}b\dot{x} = u_0 - mgl\sin{x}.\label{eq:overdamped_pend_ct}\end{equation} Our goal is to understand the long-term behavior of this system: to find $x(\infty)$ given $x(0)$. Let's start by plotting $\dot{x}$ vs $x$ for the case when $u_0=0$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;70%&quot; data-src=&quot;figures/pend_sinx.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to notice is that the system has a number of &lt;em&gt;fixed points&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;steady states&lt;/em&gt;, which occur whenever $\dot{x} = 0$. In this simple example, the zero-crossings are $x^* = \{..., -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi, ...\}$. When the system is in one of these states, it will never leave that state. If the initial conditions are at a fixed point, we know that $x(\infty)$ will be at the same fixed point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next let's investigate the behavior of the system in the local vicinity of the fixed points. Examining the fixed point at $x^* = \pi$, if the system starts just to the right of the fixed point, then $\dot{x}$ is positive, so the system will move away from the fixed point. If it starts to the left, then $\dot{x}$ is negative, and the system will move away in the opposite direction. We'll call fixed-points which have this property &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt;. If we look at the fixed point at $x^* = 0$, then the story is different: trajectories starting to the right or to the left will move back towards the fixed point. We will call this fixed point &lt;em&gt;locally stable&lt;/em&gt;. More specifically, we'll distinguish between three types of local stability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locally stable &lt;em&gt;in the sense of Lyapunov&lt;/em&gt; (i.s.L.). A fixed point, $x^*$ is locally stable i.s.L. if for every small $\epsilon &amp;gt; 0$, I can produce a $\delta &amp;gt; 0$ such that if $\| x(0) - x^* \| &amp;lt; \delta$ then $\forall t$ $\| x(t) - x^*\| &amp;lt; \epsilon$. In words, this means that for any ball of size $\epsilon$ around the fixed point, I can create a ball of size $\delta$ which guarantees that if the system is started inside the $\delta$ ball then it will remain inside the $\epsilon$ ball for all of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locally &lt;em&gt;asymptotically stable&lt;/em&gt;. A fixed point is locally asymptotically stable if $x(0) = x^* + \epsilon$ implies that $\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} x(t) = x^*$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locally &lt;em&gt;exponentially stable&lt;/em&gt;. A fixed point is locally exponentially stable if $x(0) = x^* + \epsilon$ implies that $\| x(t) - x^* \| &amp;lt; Ce^{-\alpha t}$, for some positive constants $C$ and $\alpha$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial condition near a fixed point that is stable in the sense of Lyapunov may never reach the fixed point (but it won't diverge), near an asymptotically stable fixed point will reach the fixed point as $t \rightarrow \infty$, and near an exponentially stable fixed point will reach the fixed point with a bounded rate. An exponentially stable fixed point is also an asymptotically stable fixed point, but the converse is not true. Asymptotic stability and Lyapunov stability, however, are distinct notions -- it is actually possible to have a system that is asymptotically stable but not stable i.s.L.†† we can't see that in one dimension so will have to hold that example for a moment.  Systems which are stable i.s.L. but not asymptotically stable are easy to construct (e.g. $\dot{x} = 0$). Interestingly, it is also possible to have nonlinear systems that converge (or diverge) in finite-time; a so-called &lt;em&gt;finite-time stability&lt;/em&gt;; we will see examples of this later in the book, but it is a difficult topic to penetrate with graphical analysis. Rigorous nonlinear system analysis is rich with subtleties and surprises. Moreover, these differences actually matter -- the code that we will write to stabilize the systems will be subtley different depending on what type of stability we want, and it can make or break the success of our methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our graph of $\dot{x}$ vs. $x$ can be used to convince ourselves of i.s.L. and asymptotic stability by visually inspecting $\dot{x}$ in the vicinity of a fixed point. Even exponential stability can be inferred if the function can be bounded away from the origin by a negatively-sloped line through the fixed point, since it implies that the nonlinear system will converge at least as fast as the linear system represented by the straight line. I will graphically illustrate unstable fixed points with open circles and stable fixed points (i.s.L.) with filled circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to consider what happens to initial conditions which begin farther from the fixed points. If we think of the dynamics of the system as a flow on the $x$-axis, then we know that anytime $\dot{x} &amp;gt; 0$, the flow is moving to the right, and $\dot{x} &amp;lt; 0$, the flow is moving to the left. If we further annotate our graph with arrows indicating the direction of the flow, then the entire (long-term) system behavior becomes clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;70%&quot; data-src=&quot;figures/pend_sinx_annotated.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, we can see that any initial condition $x(0) \in (-\pi,\pi)$ will result in $\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} x(t) = 0$. This region is called the &lt;em&gt;basin of attraction&lt;/em&gt; of the fixed point at $x^* = 0$. Basins of attraction of two fixed points cannot overlap, and the manifold separating two basins of attraction is called the &lt;em&gt;separatrix&lt;/em&gt;. Here the unstable fixed points, at $x^* = \{.., -\pi, \pi, 3\pi, ...\}$ form the separatrix between the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these plots demonstrate, the behavior of a first-order one dimensional system on a line is relatively constrained. The system will either monotonically approach a fixed-point or monotonically move toward $\pm \infty$. There are no other possibilities. Oscillations, for example, are impossible. Graphical analysis is a fantastic analysis tool for many first-order nonlinear systems (not just pendula); as illustrated by the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-type=&quot;example&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;

Consider the following system: \begin{equation} \dot{x} + x = \tanh(w x), \end{equation} which is plotted below for two values of $w$. It's convenient to note that $\tanh(z) \approx z$ for small $z$. For $w \le 1$ the system has only a single fixed point. For $w &amp;gt; 1$ the system has three fixed points : two stable and one unstable. &lt;img width=&quot;80%&quot; data-src=&quot;figures/pend_autapse.svg&quot;/&gt; These equations are not arbitrary - they are actually a model for one of the simplest neural networks, and one of the simplest model of persistent memorySeung00. In the equation $x$ models the firing rate of a single neuron, which has a feedback connection to itself. $\tanh$ is the activation (sigmoidal) function of the neuron, and $w$ is the weight of the synaptic feedback.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last piece of terminology. In the neuron example, and in many dynamical systems, the dynamics were parameterized; in this case by a single parameter, $w$. As we varied $w$, the fixed points of the system moved around. In fact, if we increase $w$ through $w=1$, something dramatic happens - the system goes from having one fixed point to having three fixed points. This is called a &lt;em&gt;bifurcation&lt;/em&gt;. This particular bifurcation is called a pitchfork bifurcation. We often draw bifurcation diagrams which plot the fixed points of the system as a function of the parameters, with solid lines indicating stable fixed points and dashed lines indicating unstable fixed points, as seen in the figure:&lt;/p&gt;
bifurcation diagram asymptotes to $x^* = 1$ &lt;img width=&quot;80%&quot; data-src=&quot;figures/pend_autapse_bifurcation.svg&quot;/&gt; Bifurcation diagram of the nonlinear autapse.
&lt;p&gt;Our pendulum equations also have a (saddle-node) bifurcation when we change the constant torque input, $u_0$.  Finally, let's return to the original equations in $\theta$, instead of in $x$. Only one point to make: because of the wrap-around, this system will &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; have oscillations. In fact, the graphical analysis reveals that the pendulum will turn forever whenever $|u_0| &amp;gt; \frac{mgl}{b}$, but now you understand that this is not an oscillation, but an instability with $\theta \rightarrow \pm \infty$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section data-type=&quot;sect2&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider again the system $$ml^2 \ddot\theta = u_0 - mgl \sin\theta - b\dot\theta,$$ this time with $b = 0$. This time the system dynamics are truly second-order. We can always think of any second-order system as (coupled) first-order system with twice as many variables. Consider a general, autonomous (not dependent on time), second-order system, $$\ddot{q} = f(q,\dot q,u).$$ This system is equivalent to the two-dimensional first-order system \begin{align*} \dot x_1 =&amp;amp; x_2 \\ \dot x_2 =&amp;amp; f(x_1,x_2,u), \end{align*} where $x_1 = q$ and $x_2 = \dot q$. Therefore, the graphical depiction of this system is not a line, but a vector field where the vectors $[\dot x_1, \dot x_2]^T$ are plotted over the domain $(x_1,x_2)$. This vector field is known as the &lt;em&gt;phase portrait&lt;/em&gt; of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we restrict ourselves to the simplest case when $u_0 = 0$. Let's sketch the phase portrait. First sketch along the $\theta$-axis. The $x$-component of the vector field here is zero, the $y$-component is $-mgl\sin\theta.$ As expected, we have fixed points at $\pm \pi, ...$ Now sketch the rest of the vector field. Can you tell me which fixed points are stable? Some of them are stable i.s.L., none are asymptotically stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;80%&quot; data-src=&quot;figures/pend_undamped_phase.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;section data-type=&quot;sect3&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder how we drew the black contour lines in the figure above. We could have obtained them by simulating the system numerically, but those lines can be easily obtained in closed-form. Directly integrating the equations of motion is difficult, but at least for the case when $u_0 = 0$, we have some additional physical insight for this problem that we can take advantage of. The kinetic energy, $T$, and potential energy, $U$, of the pendulum are given by $$T = \frac{1}{2}I\dot\theta^2, \quad U = -mgl\cos(\theta),$$ where $I=ml^2$ and the total energy is $E(\theta,\dot\theta) = T(\dot\theta)+U(\theta)$. The undamped pendulum is a conservative system: total energy is a constant over system trajectories. Using conservation of energy, we have: \begin{gather*} E(\theta(t),\dot\theta(t)) = E(\theta(0),\dot\theta(0)) = E_0 \\ \frac{1}{2} I \dot\theta^2(t) - mgl\cos(\theta(t)) = E_0 \\ \dot\theta(t) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{I}\left[E_0 + mgl\cos\left(\theta(t)\right)\right]} \end{gather*} Using this, if you tell me $\theta$ I can determine one of two possible values for $\dot\theta$, and the solution has all of the richness of the black countour lines from the plot. This equation has a real solution when $\cos(\theta) &amp;gt; \cos(\theta_{max})$, where $$\theta_{max} = \begin{cases} \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{E}{mgl} \right), &amp;amp; E &amp;lt; mgl \\ \pi, &amp;amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}$$ Of course this is just the intuitive notion that the pendulum will not swing above the height where the total energy equals the potential energy. As an exercise, you can verify that differentiating this equation with respect to time indeed results in the equations of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section data-type=&quot;sect2&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what happens if we add a constant torque? If you visualize the bifurcation diagram, you'll see that the fixed points come together, towards $q = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, ...$, until they disappear. One fixed-point is unstable, and one is stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we continue, let me now give you the promised example of a system that is asymptotically stable, but not stable i.s.L.. We can accomplish this with a very pendulum-like example (written here in polar coordinates):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-type=&quot;example&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system \[ \dot{r} = r(1-r) \\ \dot\theta = \sin^2 (\frac{\theta}{2}) \] is asymptotically stable to $x^* = [1,0]^T$, but is not stable i.s.L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute to draw the vector field of this (you can draw each coordinate independently, if it helps) to make sure you understand. Note that to wrap-around rotation is convenient but not essential -- we could have written the same dynamical system in cartesian coordinates without wrapping. And if this feel too arbitrary, we will see it happen in practice when we introduce the energy-shaping swing-up controller for the pendulum in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's add damping back. You can still add torque to move the fixed points (in the same way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With damping, the downright fixed point of the pendulum now becomes asymptotically stable (in addition to stable i.s.L.). Is it also exponentially stable? How can we tell? One technique is to linearize the system at the fixed point. A smooth, time-invariant, nonlinear system that is locally exponentially stable &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have a stable linearization; we'll discuss linearization more in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a thought exercise. If $u$ is no longer a constant, but a function $\pi(\theta,\dot{\theta})$, then how would you choose $\pi$ to stabilize the vertical position. Feedback linearization is the trivial solution, for example: $$u = \pi(\theta,\dot{\theta}) = 2mgl\sin\theta.$$ But these plots we've been making tell a different story. How would you shape the natural dynamics - at each point pick a $u$ from the stack of phase plots - to stabilize the vertical fixed point &lt;em&gt;with minimal torque effort&lt;/em&gt;? This is exactly the way that I would like you to think about control system design. And we'll give you your first solution techniques -- using dynamic programming -- in the next lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have developed a new cryptocurrency that drastically reduces the data users need to join the network and verify transactions — by up to 99 percent compared to today’s popular cryptocurrencies. This means a much more scalable network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrencies, such as the popular Bitcoin, are networks built on the blockchain, a financial ledger formatted in a sequence of individual blocks, each containing transaction data. These networks are decentralized, meaning there are no banks or organizations to manage funds and balances, so users join forces to store and verify the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But decentralization leads to a scalability problem. To join a cryptocurrency, new users must download and store all transaction data from hundreds of thousands of individual blocks. They must also store these data to use the service and help verify transactions. This makes the process slow or computationally impractical for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper being presented at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium next month, the MIT researchers introduce Vault, a cryptocurrency that lets users join the network by downloading only a fraction of the total transaction data. It also incorporates techniques that delete empty accounts that take up space, and enables verifications using only the most recent transaction data that are divided and shared across the network, minimizing an individual user’s data storage and processing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments, Vault reduced the bandwidth for joining its network by 99 percent compared to Bitcoin and 90 percent compared to Ethereum, which is considered one of today’s most efficient cryptocurrencies. Importantly, Vault still ensures that all nodes validate all transactions, providing tight security equal to its existing counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Currently there are a lot of cryptocurrencies, but they’re hitting bottlenecks related to joining the system as a new user and to storage. The broad goal here is to enable cryptocurrencies to scale well for more and more users,” says co-author Derek Leung, a graduate student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining Leung on the paper are CSAIL researchers Yossi Gilad and Nickolai Zeldovich, who is also a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS); and recent alumnus Adam Suhl ’18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaulting over blocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each block in a cryptocurrency network contains a timestamp, its location in the blockchain, and fixed-length string of numbers and letters, called a “hash,” that’s basically the block’s identification. Each new block contains the hash of the previous block in the blockchain. Blocks in Vault also contain up to 10,000 transactions — or 10 megabytes of data — that must all be verified by users. The structure of the blockchain and, in particular, the chain of hashes, ensures that an adversary cannot hack the blocks without detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New users join cryptocurrency networks, or “bootstrap,” by downloading all past transaction data to ensure they’re secure and up to date. To join Bitcoin last year, for instance, a user would download 500,000 blocks totaling about 150 gigabytes. Users must also store all account balances to help verify new users and ensure users have enough funds to complete transactions. Storage requirements are becoming substantial, as Bitcoin expands beyond 22 million accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers built their system on top of a new cryptocurrency network called Algorand — invented by Silvio Micali, the Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT — that’s secure, decentralized, and more scalable than other cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With traditional cryptocurrencies, users compete to solve equations that validate blocks, with the first to solve the equations receiving funds. As the network scales, this slows down transaction processing times. Algorand uses a “proof-of-stake” concept to more efficiently verify blocks and better enable new users join. For every block, a representative verification “committee” is selected. Users with more money — or stake — in the network have higher probability of being selected. To join the network, users verify each certificate, not every transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But each block holds some key information to validate the certificate immediately ahead of it, meaning new users must start with the first block in the chain, along with its certificate, and sequentially validate each one in order, which can be time-consuming. To speed things up, the researchers give each new certificate verification information based on a block a few hundred or 1,000 blocks behind it — called a “breadcrumb.” When a new user joins, they match the breadcrumb of an early block to a breadcrumb 1,000 blocks ahead. That breadcrumb can be matched to another breadcrumb 1,000 blocks ahead, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The paper title is a pun,” Leung says. “A vault is a place where you can store money, but the blockchain also lets you ‘vault’ over blocks when joining a network. When I’m bootstrapping, I only need a block from way in the past to verify a block way in the future. I can skip over all blocks in between, which saves us a lot of bandwidth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide and discard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce data storage requirements, the researchers designed Vault with a novel “sharding” scheme. The technique divides transaction data into smaller portions — or shards — that it shares across the network, so individual users only have to process small amounts of data to verify transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement sharing in a secure way, Vault uses a well-known data structure called a binary Merkle tree. In binary trees, a single top node branches off into two “children” nodes, and those two nodes each break into two children nodes, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Merkle trees, the top node contains a single hash, called a root hash. But the tree is constructed from the bottom, up. The tree combines each pair of children hashes along the bottom to form their parent hash. It repeats that process up the tree, assigning a parent node from each pair of children nodes, until it combines everything into the root hash. In cryptocurrencies, the top node contains a hash of a single block. Each bottom node contains a hash that signifies the balance information about one account involved in one transaction in the block. The balance hash and block hash are tied together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify any one transaction, the network combines the two children nodes to get the parent node hash. It repeats that process working up the tree. If the final combined hash matches the root hash of the block, the transaction can be verified. But with traditional cryptocurrencies, users must store the entire tree structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Vault, the researchers divide the Merkle tree into separate shards assigned to separate groups of users. Each user account only ever stores the balances of the accounts in its assigned shard, as well as root hashes. The trick is having all users store one layer of nodes that cuts across the entire Merkle tree. When a user needs to verify a transaction from outside of their shard, they trace a path to that common layer. From that common layer, they can determine the balance of the account outside their shard, and continue validation normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Each shard of the network is responsible for storing a smaller slice of a big data structure, but this small slice allows users to verify transactions from all other parts of network,” Leung says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers designed a novel scheme that recognizes and discards from a user’s assigned shard accounts that have had zero balances for a certain length of time. Other cryptocurrencies keep all empty accounts, which increase data storage requirements while serving no real purpose, as they don’t need verification. When users store account data in Vault, they ignore those old, empty accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
