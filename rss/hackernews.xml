<title>‘If I disappear’: Chinese students make farewell messages amid crackdowns</title>

<description>&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;BEIJING —&lt;/span&gt; The video opens with the 21-year-old sociology student facing the camera. His voice quivers as he recounts his interrogation — his humiliation — for days at the hands of Beijing police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The officials pressured him to quit labor activism and drop out of Peking University, he says. They slapped him until blood streamed from his nose. They jammed headphones into his ears and played hours of propaganda at full volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;On the last day, he alleges, they had him bend over a table naked and spread his buttocks, joking darkly that they would teach him how to insert a listening device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;“This all happened on campus,” Qiu Zhanxuan seethes in the video he recorded in February after he said the police released him, temporarily, after a four-day ordeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;“If I disappear,” he adds, “it’ll be because of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Qiu disappeared April 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;State security agents seized him that day from Beijing’s outskirts, his classmates say. Qiu’s offense? He was the leader of the Marxist student association at the elite Peking University, a communist of conscience who defied the Communist Party of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Over the past eight months, China’s ruling party has gone to extraordinary lengths to shut down the small club of students at the country’s top university. Peking University’s young Marxists drew the government’s ire after they campaigned for workers’ rights and openly criticized social inequality and corruption in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;That alone was provocative. In recent years, China’s leaders have been highly sensitive to rumblings of labor unrest as the sputtering economy lays bare the divides between rich and poor — fissures that were formed, and mostly overlooked, during decades of white-hot growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;But the source of the dissent carried an extra sting for the government. Peking University, after all, educates China’s best and brightest, the top 0.1 percent of the country’s high school graduates. And its rebellious young Marxists were doing something particularly embarrassing: They were standing up for disenfranchised workers against the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;They were, in other words, emulating the early Communist Party itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Today, at least 21 members of Peking University’s Marxist society — including its slight but steely leader Qiu — have been placed under house arrest or have vanished altogether. Scores more are regularly hauled in for interrogation and live under constant surveillance. Months of clashes, five waves of arrests and an influx of plainclothes police have, at moments, turned a world-leading university into a surreal battleground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/with-wider-crackdowns-on-religion-xis-china-seeks-to-put-state-stamp-on-faith/2018/09/15/b035e704-b7f0-11e8-b79f-f6e31e555258_story.html?utm_term=.cec0d90a5f96&quot;&gt;With wider crackdowns on religion, Xi’s China seeks to put stamp on faith&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;The story of Peking University’s Marxist club — as told by four members who remain secretly active and spoke on the condition of anonymity for their safety, their supporters, and a trove of writings and videos left by activists anticipating arrest — illustrates the anxious political atmosphere in China, where idealistic students who embrace the party’s own ideology can be suppressed just like any other political threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;It poses wider questions that go to the heart of modern China: What exactly does the Communist Party stand for? What gives it the right to rule?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Since rising to power in 2012, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly warned his Communist Party that it needs to win back the public’s faith by alleviating poverty, rooting out corrupt officials and ramping up nationalist education and propaganda work. But often, the public just doesn’t buy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;“The government stopped caring for workers long ago. It only cares about holding onto power and wealth,” a 20-something Peking University Marxist who asked to be identified as Michael said by encrypted messaging app. (Many young Chinese people use Western nicknames.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;All over China, social friction has been rising, inflamed by decades of breakneck growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;In the south, labor disputes are ticking up again after falling for a decade. In the north, Beijing officials provoked a national outcry last winter after they forcibly expelled communities of migrant workers from the capital. In China’s heartland, a city last year was occupied by thousands of decommissioned, jobless soldiers petitioning for compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;Each challenge to authority was supported, in part, by students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;“The government is scared because the domestic contradictions are growing,” Michael said. “Once you study Marxism, you know real socialism and China’s so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics are two different things. They sell fascism as socialism, like a street vendor passes off dog meat as lamb.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Singing 'The Internationale'&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Sprawling behind large gates made of vermilion-painted wood and curved tiles, Peking University’s campus in northwest Beijing has been, for a century, home to China’s intellectual vanguard and future leaders, its troublemakers and its revolutionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;A young Mao Zedong found Marxist-Leninism when he worked in the campus library. Peking University’s students marched in the May 4, 1919, protests against Western colonialism, a seminal moment in Chinese political activism. The same school led the occupation of Tiananmen Square, 30 years ago in 1989, before the government sent in soldiers and tanks, killing hundreds, perhaps far more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;As China promoted dizzying free-market reforms in the 1990s, some Peking University students cut the other direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;The Marxist association was formed in 2000 by students concerned about the economic dislocation and inequality already percolating around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;In the years that followed, the students would travel weekly to textile and electronics factories in Beijing’s outskirts. They joined assembly lines and slept and ate in dormitories to taste life at the foot of society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;For many, it was an ideological crucible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;A Marxist student who asked to be identified as Lucy worked at a print factory moving books and applying labels in southeast Beijing. She spent 12-hour shifts doing repetitive motions thousands of times, until her back was sore and her legs numb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;She was lucky she didn’t have to provide for a family on the $300- to $450-a-month salaries like the workers beside her, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;“But it was precisely the experiencing and understanding of workers’ lives that put you on the path of actually practicing Marxism,” she said. “That painful suffering is the daily existence for 300 million Chinese.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;In 2013, the group established a “workers home” on campus modeled after the social club formed in the 1920s by the Communist Party founding father and Peking University alumnus Deng Zhongxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4OTTd8wrsbSHCtZJbHSfonnWhIY=/554x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SYKKYFD4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/osVObcYmLlKnTUNvAb3m2Z3FZ1c=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SYKKYFD4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SYKKYFD4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Qiu Zhanxuan, the former leader of the Peking University Marxist society, had a political awakening when he arrived at the university, the alma mater for Chinese Communist revolutionaries including Li Dazhao. (Obtained by The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;The young Marxists would offer night classes on labor law, play chess and dance with the university’s cafeteria workers and janitors. On May Day and at year-end, students recalled, as many as 400 university workers would show up and sing “The Internationale” or early communist songs such as “The Ballad of the Anyuan Road Miners” that commemorated Mao organizing a 1922 strike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;Their membership swelled, too, to include humanities majors, medical students and budding scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;There was Zhan Zhenzhen, who was raised in a brick hut in Henan province by a single mother and didn’t know what staggering wealth looked like until he arrived in Beijing. There was Yue Xin, the daughter of a well-off Beijing family who brought the #MeToo movement to national attention in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/21/how-china-tried-stop-my-freedom-speech-canada/?utm_term=.17ad6fe9c464&quot;&gt;Opinion: How China tried to stop by freedom of speech — in Canada&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;And there was Qiu, their leader, who arrived on a rare full scholarship in 2016 after he won the gold medal in the national Chemistry Olympiad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;In a written statement he would later release, Qiu described his political evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;40&quot;&gt;Qiu’s father, laid off by the state during China’s 1990s reforms, had managed to start a new career with his technical skills. But Qiu’s uncles, who lost their jobs, were left behind as China veered toward capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;41&quot;&gt;“My father got on the last bus of ‘Reform and Opening Up,’ ” Qiu wrote, using one of the slogans from China’s turn toward a greater free market. Qiu recalled how his uncles couldn’t even afford to make $1.50 bets when the family played mah-jongg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;42&quot;&gt;“I felt the sense of inferiority in my cousins’ eyes,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;43&quot;&gt;Pun Ngai, a sociologist at Hong Kong University who has known the student group for years, said Qiu idolized a charismatic older member of the society named He Pengchao, who had obtained a PhD in environmental science at Peking University but left his career to start a labor nonprofit in Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;44&quot;&gt;By his second year, Qiu joined the Marxist club and switched his major from chemistry to sociology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;45&quot;&gt;On the WeChat social network, Qiu started posting on social issues. He turned his avatar into a picture of him clenching his fist in a Communist salute in front of a bust of Li Dazhao, the party co-founder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;46&quot;&gt;That year, Qiu, a sophomore, became the group’s president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;47&quot;&gt;A leftist blogger from eastern China who knows Qiu said it’s possible the government is holding some young Marxists until after the sensitive anniversary of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-xi-looks-to-stoke-nationalism-as-tiananmen-anniversary-approaches/2019/04/30/41caddb0-6b3c-11e9-9d56-1c0cf2c7ac04_story.html?utm_term=.17727547c2f0&quot;&gt;Tiananmen crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on June 4, and then will release them on the condition they give up activism. But the government tried that before, he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;48&quot;&gt;“They would grab them, rough them up a bit, scare them, then release them,” said the blogger, who spoke on the condition of anonymity over fear of reprisals from officials. “But then the students would go right back to activism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;49&quot;&gt;He chuckled. “It’s like they’re not scared of dying,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;50&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Warning shot&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;51&quot;&gt;Last July, the students got word that workers at a welding equipment plant near Shenzhen, called Jasic Technology, were struggling to form an independent union and clashing with factory bosses and police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;52&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Mc3rTMqZSgQIH0-oeRP4DEgbQUk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TCPJFHD4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/R1hC0X3qJ4Q0gYuyX3yGiojMk1A=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TCPJFHD4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TCPJFHD4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;Protesters demonstrate in support of factory workers of Jasic Technology, outside Yanziling police station in Shenzhen in August 2018. (Sue-Lin Wong/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;53&quot;&gt;About 50 students traveled south to help, not just from Peking University but also from Renmin and Tsinghua universities in Beijing and schools in southern and eastern China. Cramming into a large apartment, they churned out online essays that got hundreds of supportive responses. At night, they rallied Jasic workers in the streets with megaphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;54&quot;&gt;Their triumph was short-lived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;55&quot;&gt;On Aug. 24, police in riot gear raided their apartment, leading to a brief scuffle before dozens of students and workers were detained. Most were released, but four went missing, including Yue, the prominent feminist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;56&quot;&gt;In the aftermath, state media sent a warning shot to the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;57&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/15/his-death-years-ago-today-was-spark-tiananmen-square-protests/?utm_term=.76f4d4500f8b&quot;&gt;His death 30 years ago sparked the Tiananmen protests&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;58&quot;&gt;In a report, the official Xinhua News Agency avoided mentioning the involvement of students in the Jasic protests. But Xinhua reported that Jasic workers were receiving funding from an illegal, foreign source. Such allegations in Chinese state media can portend prosecutors bringing serious subversion charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;59&quot;&gt;When they returned to campus, the students were individually summoned to meet with police. One student, Lucy, recalled the police offering her a choice: confess that they broke the law and quit activism, and the police would drop the matter, maybe even help her secure a spot in graduate school. Don’t confess, they said, and she could be forced to drop out and arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;60&quot;&gt;The conversations, Lucy said, were “totally unvarnished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;61&quot;&gt;In the weeks after that, the disappearances started to mount.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;62&quot;&gt;An officer at the Yanyuan police station near the university, where students said they were usually interrogated, declined to comment about the cases or about Qiu and his allegations of mistreatment. Peking University declined to answer faxed questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;63&quot; class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;'Looking at a reflection'&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;64&quot;&gt;As the Marxist students came under attack last year, they sought help from Hu Jia, a veteran dissident who sits on the opposite end of the political spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;65&quot;&gt;Hu, who has been jailed in the past for advocating Western-style democracy, loathed how the students called for a reprise of the Cultural Revolution and wrote essays larded with propaganda language. But he helped introduce them to foreign diplomats and human rights organizations, he explained, because they seemed “righteous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;66&quot;&gt;They had the potential to be the most serious threat to the government since the Tiananmen protests, Hu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;67&quot;&gt;“The Communist Party knows there is no greater threat than a movement that links students with the lower class,” Hu said by telephone. “They’re looking at a reflection of their early revolutionary selves.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;68&quot;&gt;Perhaps sensing the potential for unrest, the Communist Party in October appointed Qiu Shuiping, a former head of the Beijing branch of the Ministry of State Security — the feared foreign and domestic spy agency — to be Peking University’s new top official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;69&quot;&gt;But the more authorities clamped down, the more the students defied them by airing what was happening on Twitter and the hosting service GitHub, services beyond the reach of Chinese censors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;70&quot;&gt;They publicized how unidentified thugs beat up their Marxist schoolmate Zhang Shengye on campus in November before taking him away. They posted pictures of Qiu, their leader, being stuffed into a black car in broad daylight on Dec. 26 — one of several run-ins he had with state security. An uploaded video from Dec. 28 showed campus security clearing Marxists from a science building, ending with a student sprawled on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;71&quot;&gt;That day, the university issued a decree that effectively disbanded the club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;72&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/z8UIfELwI40U8tjeZftB9ooU7d0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/STSAXUT4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WnpJHMvRsLBN76ql_KXvDgfIsxE=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/STSAXUT4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/STSAXUT4ZUI6TMPTWIZ74WAR54.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;A dozen students from Peking University staged a protest on Dec. 28, 2018, after the school removed the president of an on-campus Marxist group amid an ongoing crackdown on student activists. (Eva Xiao/AFP/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;73&quot;&gt;To irritate the plainclothes agents who followed them, some members would continue to get together anyway — to do calisthenics. Qiu kept leading “work experience” trips for a few more months. The authorities had enough on April 29, when they seized Qiu and four other students from a Beijing factory at 8:17 a.m., the club reported in an online post. Those five haven’t been seen since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;74&quot;&gt;“I don’t support students being naive, opposing the government,” Qiu Shike, a socialist writer and Xi supporter who is influential within some elite Communist Party circles, said carefully. “But to handle them with force seems a bit low. Why not take the high road? Have an open debate with them, or talk sense into them about why they’re wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;75&quot;&gt;As the number of missing students ticked up in recent months, those who still had freedom prepared “open letters” to be published in case they were seized. The remaining Marxists, coordinating in secret, recently started releasing the letters at a slow drip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;76&quot;&gt;They saved Qiu’s video and letter to release on May 4, on the anniversary of the protest that inspired their Communist revolutionary heroes a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;77&quot;&gt;Qiu’s letter defiantly recounted his personal life and his experiences with the police. “The deeper the persecution, the greater the blows, the more hatred one remembers in his heart,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;78&quot;&gt;In the accompanying video, Qiu seems more vulnerable. He ponders what kind of abuse workers who challenge government authority must suffer in prison, and whether he might join them himself. But his voice hardens by the end of the three-minute recording.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;79&quot;&gt;“We’ll fight together, advance and retreat together,” Qiu says, and then raises a clenched fist.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bose headphones spy on listeners: lawsuit (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bose-lawsuit-idUSKBN17L2BT</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Bose Corp spies on its wireless headphone customers by using an app that tracks the music, podcasts and other audio they listen to, and violates their privacy rights by selling the information without permission, a lawsuit charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint filed on Tuesday by Kyle Zak in federal court in Chicago seeks an injunction to stop Bose’s “wholesale disregard” for the privacy of customers who download its free Bose Connect app from Apple Inc or Google Play stores to their smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE FROM REUTERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-la/&quot;&gt;Reuters investigates: Lead poisons children in L.A., both rich and poor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN17M1OO&quot;&gt;Civil unrest rocks Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People should be uncomfortable with it,” Christopher Dore, a lawyer representing Zak, said in an interview. “People put headphones on their head because they think it’s private, but they can be giving out information they don’t want to share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bose did not respond on Wednesday to requests for comment on the proposed class action case. The Framingham, Massachusetts-based company has said annual sales top $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zak’s lawsuit was the latest to accuse companies of trying to boost profit by quietly amassing customer information, and then selling it or using it to solicit more business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying $350 for his QuietComfort 35 headphones, Zak said he took Bose’s suggestion to “get the most out of your headphones” by downloading its app, and providing his name, email address and headphone serial number in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Illinois resident said he was surprised to learn that Bose sent “all available media information” from his smartphone to third parties such as Segment.io, whose website promises to collect customer data and “send it anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio choices offer “an incredible amount of insight” into customers’ personalities, behavior, politics and religious views, citing as an example that a person who listens to Muslim prayers might “very likely” be a Muslim, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Defendants’ conduct demonstrates a wholesale disregard for consumer privacy rights,” the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zak is seeking millions of dollars of damages for buyers of headphones and speakers, including QuietComfort 35, QuietControl 30, SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II, SoundLink Color II, SoundSport Wireless and SoundSport Pulse Wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also wants a halt to the data collection, which he said violates the federal Wiretap Act and Illinois laws against eavesdropping and consumer fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dore, a partner at Edelson PC, said customers do not see the Bose app’s user service and privacy agreements when signing up, and the privacy agreement says nothing about data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edelson specializes in suing technology companies over alleged privacy violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zak v Bose Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 17-02928.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unexpected Surge in Global Methane Levels</title>
<link>https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/</guid>

&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_text_column wpb_content_element&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unexpected surge in global atmospheric methane is threatening to erase the anticipated gains of the Paris Climate Agreement.  This past April NOAA posted preliminary data documenting an historic leap in the global level of atmospheric methane in 2018,&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn1&quot; name=&quot;_ednref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; underscoring a recent wave of science and data reporting that previously stable global methane levels have unexpectedly surged in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific community recently responded to the surge into two high profile publications by calling for a reduction in methane emissions from the natural gas system, framing it as the most practical response to the global increase.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn2&quot; name=&quot;_ednref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year global methane reached a new historic high, marking the second highest year-over-year jump recorded over the last 20 years.  More importantly, the jump in 2018 extended an unanticipated multi-year resurgence of growth in global methane levels that has generated enormous concern in the science community. Scientists report that the new and unexpected methane math threatens to eliminate the anticipated gains of the Paris Climate Agreement, an agreement built upon models that assumed stable methane.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn3&quot; name=&quot;_ednref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-5257 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ch4_trend_all_gl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ch4_trend_all_gl.png 800w, https://climatenexus.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ch4_trend_all_gl-768x576.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “why” behind this resurgence is hotly debated and not well understood.   That said, most experts in the field suspect that all traditional sources (natural and anthropogenic) are contributing at least in small part to the surge, and that the biggest contributor might be wetlands responding to climate change (though there is some dissent on this point).&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn4&quot; name=&quot;_ednref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the answer to the question about which emissions source is &lt;u&gt;driving&lt;/u&gt; the methane surge is very different from the answer to the question about which emission source is best targeted in order to &lt;u&gt;address&lt;/u&gt; the surge.  It is extremely challenging to control how wetlands respond to climate change (assuming that is the driver).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, there is wide agreement among experts that, regardless of the drivers behind the surge, reducing emissions from fossil-fuel production and distribution, primarily through ending leaks and venting, is one of the few options available to control global methane levels and that this option is the most practical one. In addition, scientists report that there are narrow opportunities to address agricultural emissions, e.g. changes in the diet of livestock can reduce the production of methane without affecting production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally anthropogenic methane emissions account for roughly 48% of total methane emissions, and in turn fossil-fuel methane emissions account for roughly 34% of total anthropogenic emissions.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn5&quot; name=&quot;_ednref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the natural gas and petroleum system is the largest source of methane emissions.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn6&quot; name=&quot;_ednref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; The most recent analysis suggests that U.S. methane emissions from oil and gas activity have increased over the last 10 years at 3.4% per year,&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn7&quot; name=&quot;_ednref7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; about 40% over the decade.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn8&quot; name=&quot;_ednref8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Background&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane is a short-lived but super-potent greenhouse gas and is the second most important contributor to anthropogenic global warming after CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, accounting for one-quarter of the anthropogenic radiative imbalance (the human forcing of warming) since the pre-industrial era.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn9&quot; name=&quot;_ednref9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; Prior to the industrial era global methane levels were low and relatively stable for the last 800,000 years, ranging from 300–800 ppb.  With the advent of agriculture and then fossil fuel operations, methane levels skyrocketed to more than 1,800 ppb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1990s, the growth in global methane levels began to slow down, and global methane became relatively stable over the period of 2000-2006.  A resurgence of global methane was not anticipated and came as a surprise.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn10&quot; name=&quot;_ednref10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; Crucially, methane levels were considered stable in the pathway models prepared for the Paris Climate Agreement.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn11&quot; name=&quot;_ednref11&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, global methane levels resumed rapid growth starting in 2007.  Growth accelerated further starting in 2014 and extending through 2017.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn12&quot; name=&quot;_ednref12&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; This exceptional growth continued in 2018.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn13&quot; name=&quot;_ednref13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; NOAA recently announced that the rate of methane increase accelerated over the past five years, jumping 50 percent over the growth rate observed 2007-2013.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn14&quot; name=&quot;_ednref14&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt; The sustained growth of the last five years was last observed in the 1980s when the Soviet Union’s gas industry was developing very rapidly.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn15&quot; name=&quot;_ednref15&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first the durability of this emerging trend was questioned and years of rapid growth were seen as anomalies.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn16&quot; name=&quot;_ednref16&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;/a&gt; However, the period of resumed growth in global methane levels now stands at 12 years (2007-2018) compared to the 7-year period of stable methane levels (2000-2006).  And preliminary data from 2018 indicates that the trend of extraordinarily high growth now stands at 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this light the era of stable global methane levels is increasingly seen as the anomaly, and growth in global methane seen as the resumption of a long-standing pattern.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn17&quot; name=&quot;_ednref17&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt; This emerging consensus was highlighted in two recent high-profile papers published in 2019 representing the consensus views of a large array of experts in the field.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn18&quot; name=&quot;_ednref18&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat posed by this resumption in methane growth is significant.  A group of 23 scientists recently reported &lt;em&gt;“Thus even if anthropogenic CO2 emissions are successfully constrained to a RCP2.6-like pathway, the unexpected and sustained current rise in methane may so greatly overwhelm all progress from the other reduction efforts that the Paris Agreement will fail.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn19&quot; name=&quot;_ednref19&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[19]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the resumption of growth in global methane is now well documented, the drivers are less well understood and hotly debated.  Present global environmental monitoring networks only provide sparse information about methane concentrations, making it challenging and complex to distinguish between the myriad individual sources of methane from the fossil fuel industries, and dispersed sources like wetlands and agriculture. Gaps in monitoring also make it impossible to rule out a decrease in the efficacy of natural mechanisms that sweep methane from the atmosphere (aka “sinks”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential drivers in the category of increased emissions include emissions from intensive agricultural practices, emissions from oil and gas operations, and increased emissions from wetlands responding to global warming.  [&lt;em&gt;This last potential driver is particularly worrisome as it implies the engagement of a global warming feedback loop&lt;/em&gt;.]   A number of studies have assigned and evaluated the role of each of these drivers, with different studies assigning greater weight to different drivers; all are generally considered to play at least a minor role.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn20&quot; name=&quot;_ednref20&quot;&gt;[20]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the size of the role of fossil-fuel production and distribution in driving the recent growth of global methane is hotly debated, it is well documented that fossil-fuel production is one of the major drivers in sustaining industrial era methane levels.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn21&quot; name=&quot;_ednref21&quot;&gt;[21]&lt;/a&gt; As a result, reducing fossil-fuel methane emissions would have a significant impact in addressing the methane surge. The lifetime of methane is relatively short (∼11 years), and the elevated global methane levels of the industrial era only occur as a result of large anthropogenic emissions. Finally, fossil-fuel production and distribution is certainly one of the major sources of anthropogenic emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil-fuel methane emissions are also the most easily addressed source of emissions. The International Energy Agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2017/october/commentary-the-environmental-case-for-natural-gas.html&quot;&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; industry can reduce its worldwide emissions by 75 percent—and that up to two-thirds of those reductions (40-50% of total emissions) can be realized at zero net cost.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn22&quot; name=&quot;_ednref22&quot;&gt;[22]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are particular opportunities to address emissions from agriculture.&lt;a href=&quot;https://climatenexus.org/climate-change-news/methane-surge/#_edn23&quot; name=&quot;_ednref23&quot;&gt;[23]&lt;/a&gt; Turner et al., 2019,  note that changes in the diet of livestock could reduce the production of methane in dairy cattle without reducing milk production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context the 23 authors of Nisbet et al wrote: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;We may not be able to influence the factors driving the new rise in methane, especially if it is a climate change feedback, but by monitoring, quantifying and reducing the very large anthropogenic inputs, especially from the gas, coal and cattle industries, and perhaps by direct removal, we may be able to cut the total methane burden to be compliant with the Paris goals.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Self-distancing can help you make better decisions</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://effectiviology.com/self-distancing-rational-decisions/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3714&quot; src=&quot;https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/Self-Distancing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Self-Distancing&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;653&quot; srcset=&quot;https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/Self-Distancing.jpg 1000w, https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/Self-Distancing-300x196.jpg 300w, https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/Self-Distancing-768x502.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to set your emotions aside when you’re faced with a difficult decision. This is problematic, since our emotions often cause us to make the wrong decision in important areas of life, including in our relationships, our finances, and our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, most people find that setting these emotions aside can be rather difficult when it comes time to make a decision. However, by using a few simple self-distancing techniques, you can significantly reduce the impact of these emotions, in a way that will enable you to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following article, you will learn more about the concept of self-distancing, understand why it’s beneficial, and see what you can do in order to implement self-distancing techniques in situations where you need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is self-distancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-distancing&lt;/em&gt; is the act of increasing the distance from your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://effectiviology.com/egocentric-bias/&quot;&gt;egocentric perspective&lt;/a&gt; when assessing events and emotions that you experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, a &lt;strong&gt;self-&lt;em&gt;distanced&lt;/em&gt; perspective&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; perspective that &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0963721411408883&quot;&gt;you can use&lt;/a&gt; when thinking about an event that you’ve experienced, where the &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; who is analyzing the event is considered to be distinct from the &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; who experienced it. For example, a self-distanced perspective is the perspective that you use when you ask yourself “why did &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; just do that?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contrasted with a &lt;strong&gt;self-&lt;em&gt;immersed&lt;/em&gt; perspective&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; perspective that you can also use when thinking about an event that you’ve experienced, where the &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; who is analyzing the event is considered to be identical to the &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; who experienced it. For example, a self-immersed perspective is the perspective that you use when you ask yourself “why did &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; just do that?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Examples of self-distancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t want to make an emotional decision. I wanted to do what was best for LeBron James and what would make him happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Basketball player LeBron James describing &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.li/z1wYs&quot;&gt;his decision&lt;/a&gt; to leave his old team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of how people can use self-distancing appears in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0035173&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that examined people’s self-talk mechanism, which is a form of &lt;em&gt;intrapersonal communication&lt;/em&gt; that people use when they think (i.e. their inner monologue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ starting point was that you can promote self-distance during times of introspection, by using the second-person pronoun (“you”) or by using your own name (e.g. “John”) when thinking about yourself, instead of using the first-person pronoun (“I”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/a0018963&quot;&gt;is based&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;construal level theory&lt;/em&gt;, which suggests that creating psychological distance in one domain can promote psychological distance in other domains, so that increasing people’s psychological distance from a certain event by changing their linguistic self-distance could affect how close they feel to that event from an emotional perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, the researchers asked the participants in their experiment to recall two personal experiences, one of which was anger-related and one of which was anxiety-related. There were two groups of participants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participants in the first group were instructed to think about themselves in the first person.&lt;/strong&gt; This means, for example, that participants in this group would ask themselves “why did &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; feel this way?”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participants in the second group were instructed to think about themselves using second-person pronouns or using their own name.&lt;/strong&gt; This means, for example, that participants in this group would ask themselves “why did &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; feel this way?” or “why did &lt;em&gt;Jane&lt;/em&gt; feel this way?”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then measured participants’ self-distance during their recollection of their past experiences. What they found was that the simple change in perception allowed participants to increase their emotional self-distance when considering these events, as we see in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-58 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Effects-linguistic-perception-self-distance.png&quot; alt=&quot;A graph which shows how a variation in linguistic perception impacts psychological self-distance. When thinking of events which are anger-related or anxiety-related, using non-first-person pronouns increases self distance compared to using first-person pronouns.&quot; width=&quot;1082&quot; height=&quot;654&quot; srcset=&quot;https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Effects-linguistic-perception-self-distance.png 1082w, https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Effects-linguistic-perception-self-distance-300x181.png 300w, https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Effects-linguistic-perception-self-distance-768x464.png 768w, https://effectiviology.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Effects-linguistic-perception-self-distance-1024x619.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1082px) 100vw, 1082px&quot;/&gt;Data is from: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035173&quot;&gt;Self-talk as a regulatory mechanism: How you do it matters&lt;/a&gt;“.

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, when people referred to themselves in the second-person or using their own name, they were able to improve their ability to detach emotionally from the situation. This improvement is important, because increasing emotional self-distance has been shown to have several important benefits, as we will see in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of self-distancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that using self-distancing techniques can be beneficial in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as we saw in the example above, self-distancing can &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0035173&quot;&gt;help people cope&lt;/a&gt; with difficult events from their past. This is in line with other research on the topic, which shows that self-distancing can &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/a0028289&quot;&gt;decrease the duration&lt;/a&gt; of negative emotions and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.012&quot;&gt;help reduce&lt;/a&gt; aggressive thoughts and angry feelings. Furthermore, self-distancing can also &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0035173&quot;&gt;help people deal&lt;/a&gt; with socially distressful situations, even when those people are naturally prone to social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this is attributed to the fact self-distancing encourages people &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00301.x&quot;&gt;to engage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;adaptive self-reflection&lt;/em&gt;, which allows them to handle difficult emotions in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0019205&quot;&gt;positive manner&lt;/a&gt;. This is contrasted with using a self-immersed perspective, which often leads to &lt;em&gt;maladaptive self-reflection&lt;/em&gt;, which involves, for example, the tendency to obsessively ruminate over past events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of using self-distancing is related to people’s &lt;em&gt;wise reasoning&lt;/em&gt;, which is the ability to do things such as recognize the limits of your knowledge and remember the importance of being willing to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, people tend to display high levels of wise reasoning when they give advice to others, but not when they decide how to act themselves. However, when people use self-distancing techniques, by asking themselves what kind of advice they would give to a friend if they were in the same situation, people are able &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797614535400&quot;&gt;to reduce&lt;/a&gt; this asymmetry in their insights, and apply the same reasoning skills to their own dilemmas as they would to those of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, increasing self-distance also has direct benefits when it comes to improving people’s decision-making ability, since self-distancing has been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797611432178&quot;&gt;reduce decisional biases&lt;/a&gt; under a variety of conditions, and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0030730&quot;&gt;improve decision-making&lt;/a&gt; during times of information overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, research shows that smart implementation of self-distancing techniques has numerous benefits. These include, among others, an improved ability to cope with negative emotions, an improved ability to cope with stressful situations, and an improved ability to make rational decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to create self-distance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various techniques that you can use in order to increase your psychological self-distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as we saw earlier, you can use self-distancing langauge, by referring to yourself in the second or third-person in your internal monologue. For example, this means that when faced with a difficult decision, instead of asking yourself “why am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; worried about this?” you should ask yourself “why are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; worried about this?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also increase your self-distance by trying to view the situation from an alternative viewpoint, that is different from your own. For example, if you got into a fight with someone, you could try to consider what the fight looked like not only from your own perspective, but also from the perspective of the other person, or from the perspective of an external observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in some cases, when deciding what to do, you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12314&quot;&gt;try to visualize&lt;/a&gt; the perspective of an &lt;em&gt;exemplar&lt;/em&gt;, which is someone you admire, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12695&quot;&gt;ask yourself&lt;/a&gt; what would they do in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can also create self-distance through other methods, such as expressive writing, which involves writing about your thoughts and feelings when you’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0000121&quot;&gt;trying to analyze&lt;/a&gt; an event that you’ve experience&lt;span&gt;d.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are many techniques that you can use to increase your self-distance, in order to help yourself make more rational decisions. The two most notable techniques for this involve using self-distancing language in your inner monologue, or visualizing other people’s perspective when analyzing events that you’ve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary and Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-distancing&lt;/em&gt; involves increasing the psychological distance from your own self-centered perspective when assessing events that you experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-distancing allows you to detach yourself from emotional situations, which can help you cope with negative emotions, such as stress and anger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-distancing can also help you to make more rational decisions, and encourage you to use effective reasoning skills when deciding how to act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create self-distance by modifying the language that you use during times of introspection, and specifically by referring to yourself in the second or third-person (e.g. “what should &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; do?” or “what should &lt;em&gt;John&lt;/em&gt; do?”) instead of using the first-person pronoun (e.g. “what should &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do?”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also create self-distance by considering events from an external perspective that is different than your own, such as the perspective of a person that you were talking to, or the perspective of an external observer who watched an interaction that you were involved in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>SpaceX Raptor: Methane fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle engine</title>
<link>https://everydayastronaut.com/raptor-engine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://everydayastronaut.com/raptor-engine/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LbH1ZDImaI8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s new Raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and it’s so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX’s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle’s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9857&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/StarHopper-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SpaceX Starhopper raptor engine boca chica everyday astronaut&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that’s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they’re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we’ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by the end of this article hopefully we’ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it’s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In case you didn’t notice when you clicked on this article… this is a VERY VERY long article… sorry, not sorry. BUT, if you’re anything like me, you keep hearing a lot of hype about the Raptor engine and you want to appreciate it… but you don’t even know where to start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well, I’ve spent quite a while really studying up on this subject so I can lay down a good foundation in order to help us fully appreciate the Raptor engine, well and quite frankly, all rocket engines!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9856&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rocket-engine-diagram-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocket engine schematics diagram&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you’re anything like me, maybe you’ve stared at diagrams like this for hours and your head explodes every single time. So to avoid that, I’ve personally whipped up some very simplified versions of the rocket engine cycles for us all to enjoy, which will hopefully help us grasp these concepts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9855&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Open-Cycle-diagram-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open cycle rocket engine diagram flow&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now we’re going to start with a super quick physics lesson, but bear with me, we’ll dive in and get plenty of nitty gritty details… we’ll leave no stone unturned and by the end of this article&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;hopefully you’ll have a strong grasp of how rocket engines work, the different versions of liquid fueled rocket engines, why methane is a valid choice for fuel, and you’ll know exactly how the Raptor engine stacks up against some other popular rocket engines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rockets are basically just propellant with some skin around it to keep it in place and they have a thing on the back that can throw said propellant really really fast. And to way over simplify it even more, the faster you can throw that propellant, the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9854&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pressure-Fed-engine-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pressure fed rocket engine&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The easiest way to do this is by storing all the propellant in your tanks under really high pressure, then put a valve on one end of the tank and a propelling nozzle that accelerates the propellant into workable thrust. DONE! No crazy pumps, or complicated systems, just open a valve and let er rip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is called a pressure fed rocket engine and there’s a few main types; cold gas, monoprop and bipropellant pressure fed engines. You’ll often find these used for reaction control systems because they’re simple, reliable and quick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9859&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pressure-fed-3-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pressure fed rocket engine high to low pressure&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But pressure fed engines have one big limiting factor. Pressure always flows from high to low, so the engine can never be higher pressure than the propellant tanks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to store propellant under high pressure, your tanks will need to be strong and therefore thicker and heavier. Look at composite overwrapped pressure vessels or COPVs. They’re capable of storing gasses at up to almost 10,000 psi or about 700 bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9853&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Heavy-Pressure-fed-engine-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Increase pressure engine tanks copv thick walls&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite this, there’s still a limited amount of propellant and pressure they can store. This does not scale up very well when you’re trying to deliver a payload to orbit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So smart rocket scientists quickly realized in order to make the rocket as lightweight as possible, there’s really only ONE thing they could do. Increase the enthalpy. That would be a great 90’s metal band name. You’re welcome internet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9852&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Incrase-the-enthalpy-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jeff bezos vs elon musk increase the enthalpy tory bruno jim bridenstine Peter Beck&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enthalpy is basically the relationship between volume, pressure and temperature. A higher pressure and temperature inside the combustion chamber equals higher efficiency and more mass shoved through the rocket engine equals more thrust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So in order to shove more propellant into the engine, you could either increase the pressure in the tanks, or just shoot the propellant into the combustion chamber with a high powered PUMP. Huh, the second option sounds like a good idea!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But PUMPS moving hundreds of liters of fuel per second require a lot and boy do I mean a lot of energy to power them. So what if you took a tiny rocket engine and aimed it right at a turbine to spin it up really fast? You could exchange some of the rocket propellant’s chemical energy for kinetic energy which then could be used to spin these powerful pumps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9851&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Turbo-pump-1-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Turbo pump shooting at turbine diagram&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Welcome to turbopumps and the staged combustion cycle! But you’ve still got some limiting factors, like how high pressure always wants to go to low pressure and how heat has that habit of melting things… So you’ve got to keep all these factors in check while trying to squeeze every bit of power out of your engine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now there’s actually a lot of cycles here we could talk about, but I’m going to stick with the three most common, or at least the three that matter the most when putting the Raptor into context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have the gas generator cycle, the partial flow staged combustion cycle and lastly we’ll look at the full flow staged combustion cycle… and perhaps in a future article I’ll try and do a full rundown of all liquid fueled rocket engines including fun new alternatives like the electric pump fed engines seen on Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s start with the gas generator cycle otherwise known as the open cycle. This is probably one of the most common types of liquid fueled rocket engines used on orbital rockets. It’s definitely more complicated than a pressure fed system, but it’s fairly simple, well at least compared to their closed cycle counter parts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9850&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/F-1-engine-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;F-1 engine pumps valves pipes&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now I’m going to way way over simplify this so it’s as easy to grasp as possible. In real life there’s literally dozens of valves, a hive of wires and extra small pipes, helium to back pressure the tanks, fuel flowing through the nozzle and the combustion chamber to cool it, and an ignition source for the preburner and the combustion chamber….&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But again, for the purposes of making this simple and as digestible as possible, just know there’s a lot of stuff missing, but we’re focusing on the flow of these engines to get that concept down. Then once you grasp these simple versions, it’ll be much easier to look at one like this and not have your head explode.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9849&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Open-Cycle-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open cycle gas generator diagram schematic flow&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The gas-generator cycle works by pumping the fuel and oxidizer into the combustion chamber using a turbopump. The turbopump has a few main parts, a mini rocket engine called the preburner, a turbine connected to a shaft and then a pump or two that push propellant into the combustion chamber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You might hear the turbopump assembly called the powerpack because it really is what powers the engine.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;In the open cycle system, the spent propellant from the preburner is simply dumped overboard and does not contribute any significant thrust. This makes it less efficient since the fuel and oxidizer used to spin the pumps is basically wasted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayastronaut.com/shop&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9014&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ad-placement-1024x512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;space rocket merchandise spacex shirts shirt hats mug moon lamp light 3d printed grid fin not a coasters patch spaceflight merch swag shop webstore&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;512&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now the funny thing about a turbopump is that it’s kind of has a chicken and egg syndrome situation that makes it pretty difficult to start up since the preburner that powers the turbopump needs high pressure fuel and oxidizer to operate…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So the preburners requires the turbopumps to spin before it can get up to full operational pressure itself, but the turbopumps need the preburner to fire in order to spin the turbopumps… but the preburner needs the turbopumps etc etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This makes starting a gas generator tricky. There’s a few ways to do this, but we don’t need to get into all of that in this article, that sounds like a fun topic for a future article though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So back to the turbopumps, remember, pressure always flows from high to low, so the turbopumps need to be a higher pressure than the chamber pressure. This means the inlets leading into the preburner is actually the highest pressure point in the entire rocket engine, everything downstream is lower pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9848&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Preburner-Exhaust-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Preburner exhaust soot merlin engine open cycle&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But notice something here. Take a look at SpaceX’s Merlin engine which runs on RP-1 or Rocket Propellant 1 and Liquid Oxygen. Notice how black the smoke is coming out of the preburner exhaust…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why would it be so sooty compared to the main combustion chamber which leaves almost no visible exhaust? Well that’s because rocket propellant can get super hot…. Like thousands and thousands of degrees Celsius.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So to make sure the temperature isn’t so hot it melts the turbine and the entire turbopump assembly, they need to make sure it’s cool enough to continually operate. Running at the perfect fuel and oxygen ratio is the most efficient and releases the most energy, but it also produces a crazy amount of heat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to keep the temperatures low, you can run the preburner at a less than optimal ratio, so either too much fuel known as fuel rich or too much oxidizer or oxygen rich.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Running an RP-1 engine fuel rich means you’ll see some unburnt fuel appearing as dark clouds of soot. The highly pressurized unburnt carbon molecules bond and form polymers which is a process known as coking. This soot starts to stick to everything it touches and can block injectors or even do damage to the turbine itself!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9847&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Preburner-exhaust-2-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Preburner exhaust soot engine open cycle&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what if you didn’t want to waste that highly pressurized propellant… I mean afterall, since it’s running cooler by being fuel rich, doesn’t that mean there’s a bunch of unburnt fuel literally being wasted?  What if you could just pipe that hot exhaust gas and put it into the combustion chamber? Welcome to the closed cycle!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The closed cycle or staged combustion cycle increases engine efficiency by using what would normally be lost exhaust and connects it to the combustion chamber to help increase pressure and therefore increase efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s take the Merlin engine and try closing the loop. Let’s take that exhaust and just pipe it into the combustion chamber! UH OH!!!! OH NOOOOOOO we just put a bunch of soot and clogged all your injectors. You do not go to space today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9846&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Closing-the-loop-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Closing the loop of an open cycle closed cycle clogged injectors&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there’s a few solutions to this problem, so let’s see how the Soviets solved this problem.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The first operational closed cycle engine they made was the NK-15 designed for their N-1 moon rocket, they later upgraded it to the NK-33 and then many versions from there stemmed out including the RD-180 which is what is used on the Atlas V today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9844&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NK15-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Soviet NK15 NK33 being built&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the NK-15 and NK-33 runs on RP-1 like the Merlin, you can’t run your preburners fuel rich because of the coking problem… so if you want to create a closed cycle engine with RP-1 the answer is running the preburner oxygen rich.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Easy as that right? Well now you’re blasting SUPER HEATED highly pressurized gaseous oxygen which will turn anything into soup, right at a precision machined, crazy high tolerance turbine blade.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9845&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Preburner-and-turbine-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Turbine and preburner&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doing this was actually considered impossible by the United States, so they basically gave up on trying. They didn’t think a metal alloy existed that could withstand these crazy crazy conditions, and they didn’t believe the Soviets made such an efficient and powerful RP-1 powered engine until after the collapse of the Soviet Union and US engineers got to see them and test them out first hand!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But the Soviets had indeed worked their butts off and made a special alloy that can magically,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;with science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, withstand the crazy conditions of an oxygen rich preburner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a closed cycle engine, you don’t just use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;fuel and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;oxidizer and burn that in the preburner to spin the turbine, you actually shoot ALL of the rich propellant through the turbine.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So with an oxygen rich cycle, all of the oxygen actually goes through the preburner and just the right amount of fuel goes to the preburner. You only need enough to give the turbine the right amount of energy to spin the pumps fast enough to get the right pressures for the preburner and the combustion chamber to make the right power to shoot a thing into space AH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9841&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Closed-cycle-1-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Closed cycle oxygen oxidizer rich NK33 RD180 &quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sorry, so back to this oxygen rich preburner, that now hot gas oxygen is forced into the combustion chamber where it meets liquid fuel. They meet and go boom and we get a nice clean and efficient burn without really wasting any propellant! HUZZAH!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;BUT STILL like all engines, the chamber pressure cannot be higher than the pump pressure, so the pumps actually have a lot of weight on their metal little shoulders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now if you’re sitting there wondering if the United States just sat back and let the Soviets have all the closed cycle glory, you’d be wrong. It took the US a bit longer, but they eventually figured out a closed cycle engine, but it was very different from the oxygen rich cycle…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The United States pursued a closed loop cycle but they went with a fuel rich preburner. But wait…. We just learned that a fuel rich preburner’s exhaust is so sooty, it will ruin just about anything… right?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well sure, if you’re using RP-1 or any other carbon heavy fuel, that’s definitely going to be the outcome… so the United States went with a different fuel, Hydrogen!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Ok, so now we’ve avoided one problem of blasting crazy hot high pressure oxygen at everything dear and precious, but now we’ve opened up a new can of worms… &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Hydrogen is significantly less dense than RP-1 or liquid oxygen. As a matter of fact, it’s so much less dense it takes a HUGE turbopump to flow the right amount of hydrogen into the combustion chamber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-9839 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Single-shaft-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Single shaft turbopump F1 turbopump assembly&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since RP-1 and LOX are relatively similar density and ratios, they can be run on a single shaft using a single preburner….&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But with Hydrogen you need to run even more Hydrogen per mass of oxygen, so between being less dense and needing a higher fuel ratio with Hydrogen, the pumps are drastically different between the Hydrogen and LOX.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9840&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SSME-powerhead-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SSME Rs25 powerpack powerhead turbopump hydrogen pump preburner&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of this, the engineers at Rocketdyne pursued an engine known as the RS-25 which would go on to power the space shuttle. They realized that because of the large difference between pumps, they might as well just have two preburners, one for the hydrogen pump and one for the oxygen pump. So that’s what they did!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9838&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hydrogen-leaking-SSME-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leaking hydrogen preburners ssme rs25 hydrogen seals purge seal&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But having two separate shafts created ANOTHER new problem. Now engineers were putting high pressure hot gaseous hydrogen on the same shaft and right next door to the liquid oxygen pump. If some of the hydrogen would leak out of the preburner, it would start a fire in the lox pump, which is catastrophically bad.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Hydrogen is also very hard to contain, because it’s so not dense, un dense? Lightweight? It likes to sneak through cracks and get out anywhere it can. So engineers had to make an elaborate seal to keep the hot hydrogen from sneaking out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9837&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Purge-seal-ssme-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Purge seal ssme rs-25&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The seal required for this is called a purge seal and it’s actually pressurized by helium so it’s the highest point of pressure, so if the seal leaks, it just leaks inert helium! Genius.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But take a look at how different the LOX turbopump and the hydrogen turbo pump seals look. You can tell how much more engineering time and effort had to go into those lox seals. THE PEOPLE THAT THINK OF THIS STUFF ARE NUTS!!!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok now that we’ve talked all about the dual burner, fuel rich RS-25, here’s a simplified diagram of that. I didn’t bother making the fuel pumps different sizes as I just want to focus on the flow here and help make that simple. But do note, both preburners of the RS-25 run fuel rich, so although they might look the same, they power different pumps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9835&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Closed-cycle-fuel-rich-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fuel rich closed cycle rs-25 diagram ssme &quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But do note, both preburners of the RS-25 BOTH run fuel rich, they just power different pumps.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The RS-25 is still considered to be about the best engine ever made with a fairly high thrust to weight ratio and unmatched efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the closed cycle improves the overall performance of the engine and is highly advantageous, so how could it get any better than this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re finally ready to talk about the full flow staged combustion cycle which basically just combines the two closed cycle methods we just talked about. With the full flow staged combustion cycle, you take two preburners, one that runs fuel rich and one that runs oxygen rich.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The fuel rich preburner powers the fuel pump and the oxygen rich preburner powers the LOX. This means the full flow cycle needs to tackle the oxidizer rich problems, which again is solved by developing very strong metal alloys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9834&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Full-flow-staged-combustion-cycle-engine-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full Flow staged combustion cycle diagram schematic&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, SpaceX developed their own superalloy in house that they named SX500. According to Elon, it’s capable of over 800 bar of hot oxygen-rich gas. That may have been one of the biggest hurdles in developing the Raptor engine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9833&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fuel-rich-and-oxy-rich-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full Flow staged combustion cycle diagram schematic&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Luckily, the fuel rich side only pumps fuel, so if some hot fuel leaks through the seal on the shaft, it just comes in contact with more fuel, no big deal.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Full flow likely wouldn’t work with RP-1 due to the coking problems with a fuel rich preburner, but other fuels are still valid to use this design, more on that in a minute…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The advantage of this system is that since both the fuel and oxidizer arrive in the combustion chamber as a hot gas, there’s better combustion and hotter temperatures can be achieved.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;There also is less need of that crazy sealing system as we mentioned earlier, which makes for less refurbishment. That’s a good thing when you plan to reuse your engine over and over with little to no maintenance between flights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And lastly because there’s an inherent increase in mass flow, or how quickly all the propellant is shooting into the preburner, the turbines can run cooler and at lower pressures because the ratio of fuel and oxidizer needed to spin the turbopumps is much lower.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And think of it this way, in an open cycle, you only want to use as little fuel and oxidizer as possible in the preburners since it’s all wasted, and you want it to be as hot as withstandable to make it more efficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9832&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FFSC-vs-open-cycle-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full Flow staged combustion cycle diagram schematic vs open cycle&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But with a full flow cycle since ALL of the fuel and ALL of the oxidizer goes through the preburners, you can burn as much propellant as necessary to power the turbopumps….&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;BUT, your fuel to oxidizer ratio will be so crazy fuel rich and oxygen rich that the temperatures at the turbines will be much lower and this means longer lifespans for the turbopump assembly. It also means more combustion happens in the combustion chamber and less in the preburner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now here’s the crazy part. Only three engines have demonstrated the full flow staged combustion cycle… EVER.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9831&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RD-270-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RD 270 engine&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 60’s the Soviet’s developed an engine called the RD-270 which never flew, and in the early 2000’s Aerojet and Rocketdyne worked on an integrated powerhead demonstrator called, wait for it, the integrated powerhead demonstrator which again, never made it past the test stand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9830&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Intigrated-powerhead-demonstrator-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Integrated powerhead demonstrator&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the third attempt at developing a full flow staged combustion cycle engine is SpaceX’s Raptor engine!!!! TA DA!!! WE DID IT!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s right, the Raptor engine is only the THIRD attempt at making this crazy type of engine. It’s the first to ever do any work and leave the test stand! And fingers crossed, it’ll be the first full flow staged combustion cycle engine to reach orbit too. Well, actually, just about everything this engine does will be a first.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But all this means SpaceX had to tackle many very difficult problems. Not only did they need to solve the same problems with an oxygen rich cycle, they also had to precisely control fuel to create the highest chamber pressure of any rocket engine ever, at 270 bar, finally beating the RD-180’s record of around 265 bar. And they’re not done, they’re targeting 300 bar, which is just plain nutty, more on that in a second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9828&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/All-engine-cycles-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;All rocket engine cycles open cycle closed cycle fuel rich oxygen rich full flow staged combustion cycle diagram schematic flow&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the Raptor can’t run a fuel rich preburner using RP-1, you’d think the next most logical choice would be Hydrogen… well SpaceX didn’t opt for either RP-1 or Hydrogen, they went with Liquid Methane!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;So NOW we finally have another topic to touch on… why did SpaceX chose liquid methane for the Raptor engine? What are the qualities that make it advantageous over hydrogen or RP-1?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To date, no liquid methane or methalox engine has gone to orbit, so what qualities does it have that make it desirable?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Let’s take a look at methalox compared to keralox and hydrolox… let’s put methane in between RP-1 and Hydrogen… you’ll see why pretty quickly…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s start off with perhaps the biggest factor when designing your first stage. The density of the propellant. Having a denser fuel means the tanks are smaller and lighter for a given mass of fuel. A smaller tank = a lighter rocket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9827&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Fuel-graph-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Methane methalox rocket fuel vs hydrogen hydrolox vs rp1 keralox&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So here’s the density of these three fuels measured in grams per liter, in other words how much does one liter of this stuff weigh, or really what’s its mass?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting off with RP-1, one liter is around 813 grams, RP-1 is 11 times more dense than Hydrogen which is only 70 grams per liter, and Methalox is right in the middle at 422 grams per liter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remember how airships or zeppelins used to be filled with hydrogen to make them “lighter than air”… That’s because Hydrogen is so much less dense than our atmosphere, it makes for an excellent, albeit flammable gas for a balloon. I mean, we all remember the Hindenburg… right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It should also be noted that 813 grams per liter is an average for RP-1, but SpaceX chills their RP-1 in their Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy for about a 2%-4% increase in density. But historically, RP-1’s density is right around that 813 grams per liter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayastronaut.com/shop&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9014&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ad-placement-1024x512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;space rocket merchandise spacex shirts shirt hats mug moon lamp light 3d printed grid fin not a coasters patch spaceflight merch swag shop webstore&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;512&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So in the case of density, Methane is kind of right in the middle of the others. But there’s more to it than just density, we also need to take into consideration the ratio of how much fuel is burned compared to how much oxidizer is burned. This is the oxidizer to fuel ratio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So here’s where things get a little more interesting and the tables turn a little. Rocket engineers have to take into account the mass of the fuel and the corresponding weight of the tanks, so they don’t actually burn propellant at the perfect stoichiometric combustion ratio, they find the perfect happy medium that balances tank size with thrust output and specific impulse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s look at the mass ratios of fuel and oxidizer that the engineers have come up with… So for these numbers RP-1 is burned at 2.7 grams of oxygen to 1 gram of RP-1, Hydrogen burns at 6 grams of oxygen to 1 grams of hydrogen, and Methane burns at 3.7 grams oxygen to 1 grams Methane. These numbers can now help offset a little the massive difference in density.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9860&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Fuel-tank-sizes-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hydrolox hydrogen fuel tank size vs methane methalox vs rp1 keralox vs LOX liquid oxygen density&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s visualize this to help make it easier to digest. Liquid oxygen is 1,141 grams per liter, it’s a little more dense than RP-1. So burning LOX and RP-1 at a 2.7 to 1 ratio, for every liter of LOX you’d need a little over half a liter of RP-1.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Next up let’s do Hydrogen. Now with Hydrogen being 11 times less dense than RP-1, you’d think it’d need a tank that’s 11 times bigger… but luckily, engineers have found that it pays to burn LOX and Hydrogen at a 6:1 ratio for a good compromise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means for each liter of LOX, you’d need 2.7 liters of hydrogen! So your fuel tank needs to be approximately 5 times larger compared to RP-1… so yeah…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9862&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/F9-vs-DIV-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Falcon 9 RP-1 tank and oxygen tank vs delta iv hydrogen tank and lox tank size density&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s why when we look at a Hydrogen powered Delta IV vs an RP-1 powered Falcon 9, you can see the fuel tank is much smaller than the LOX tank on the Falcon 9, but the Delta IV is about the opposite! The LOX tank is MUCH smaller than it’s fuel tank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So now let’s look at that methane. Now this one is interesting. LOX is 2.7 times more dense than liquid methane, but the burn ratio is 3.7 grams of oxygen to 1 gram of methane. So you’d need .73 liters of methane for every liter of LOX.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;In other words, your fuel tank would need to be about 40% bigger for methalox than it would need to be for RP-1, despite RP-1 actually being almost twice as dense! And compared to Hydrogen, it’s fuel tank would be 3.7 times smaller.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the fuel to oxidizer ratio helps make Methalox’s fuel tanks a lot closer to RP-1 than it is to Hydrolox.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another huge variable with any rocket engine is how efficient it is. This is measured in specific impulse or ISP, but you can think of this like the fuel economy of a gas powered car. So a high specific impulse would be similar to a high mpg or kmpl.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The best way to think of specific impulse is imagine you had one kg of propellant, for how many seconds can the engine push with 9.81 newtons of force? The longer it can sip on the fuel while still pushing that hard, the higher its specific impulse, and therefore the more work it can do with the same amount of fuel. IE, it’s fuel economy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So the higher the specific impulse, the less fuel it takes to do the same amount of work, which is a good thing. A fuel efficient engine is extremely important!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And now due to the molecular weight of each fuel and their energy released when burned, there’s a different potential for how quickly the exhaust gas can be expelled out the nozzle. This means each fuel has a different theoretical specific impulse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an ideal and perfect world an RP-1 powered engine could achieve about 370 seconds, an ideal Hydrogen powered engine could get 532 seconds and guess what, a methane powered engine is right in the middle with 459 seconds.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Real world examples of this though are much lower with RP-1 engines seeing around 350 seconds (Merlin 1D Vacuum), around 380 seconds for a methane engine (raptor vacuum) and about 465 seconds for a hydrogen engine (RL-10B-2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, let’s talk about how hot each fuel burns. A fuel that burns cooler is easier on the engine and potentially makes for a longer lifespan.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;RP1 can burn up to 3670  kelvin, Hydrogen 3,070 kelvin and if you haven’t guessed it by now, Methane is again between the two at 3550 kelvin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking of thermal considerations, let’s look at the boiling point of these fuels or at what point does the liquid fuel boil off and turn into a gas? Since all of these fuels need to remain in their liquid state in order to stay dense, the higher the temperature, the easier it is to store the fuel.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;A higher boiling also means less or even no insulation on the tanks to keep the propellant from boiling off. And of course, less insulation means lighter tanks. YAY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;RP-1 has a very high boiling point, even higher than water at 490 kelvin. Hydrogen on the other hand is near absolute zero at a crazy crazy cold 20 kelvin! That is insanely cold and it takes serious considerations to keep anything at that temperature. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;And like the goldilocks it is… methane is between the two at 111 kelvin, which although that’s still very cold, and requires thermal considerations, it at least boils off at a temperature similar to LOX, so there’s that!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And because it’s so close to the temperature of LOX, the tanks can share a common dome, which makes the vehicle lighter. LOX and Hydrogen’s temperatures vary so wildly that LOX will boil off hydrogen and the hydrogen will freeze the LOX solid!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now onto exhaust, what are the byproducts of combustion with these engines? RP-1 is really the only one of these three that really pollutes with any unburnt carbon being left in the atmosphere along side water vapor, but Hydrogen only produces water vapor and Methane produces some carbon dioxide and water vapor. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But an interesting note, believe it or not, as far as greenhouse gases go, water in the upper atmosphere can be pretty bad… But, I’ll be doing an article in the future about how much rockets pollute, talking about both air pollution, but also ocean pollution and even space debris as a consideration. So standby as that’s one that I think is very interesting!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One metric we’re going to talk about, but only generally is the cost associated with each fuel. These tend to vary considerably and it’s actually really hard to pin down exact prices reliably. But for considerations, RP-1 is basically a highly refined jet fuel, which jet fuel is a highly refined kerosene, which kerosene is a highly refined diesel. So, it’s safe to assume it’s going to be more expensive than diesel fuel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hydrogen is also relatively expensive despite being abundant, refining it, storing it and transporting it can be expensive. Methane on the other hand is basically the same thing as natural gas and can be relatively cheap.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;When you’re talking about buying literal tons of fuel, the fuel cost can add up quickly, so although the cost of fuel shouldn’t factor in too much, it certainly is a consideration… but without hard data on this one, I don’t even want to put it on our chart, SO, instead… let’s talk about the more important aspect of the fuel. Manufacturing it…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s where we get into specifically why SpaceX sees Methane as an important, or even a necessary part of their companies future.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;SpaceX’s ultimate goals are to develop a system capable of taking humans out to Mars and back over and over. The Mars atmosphere is CO2 rich, combine that with water mining from the surface and subsurface water on Mars through electrolysis and the sabatier process, the Martian atmosphere can be made into Methane fuel! So you don’t have to take all the fuel you need to get home with you. You can make it right there using Mars’ resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is called in-situ resource utilization or ISRU. Now you might be thinking, well if there’s water, can’t you just make Hydrogen on the surface of Mars for your fuel? Well, yes, but one of the biggest problems with Hydrogen and long duration missions is the boiling point of Hydrogen. It takes serious considerations to maintain Hydrogen in a liquid state necessary to be a useful fuel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So for SpaceX, methane makes a lot of sense! It’s fairly dense meaning the rockets size remains reasonable, it’s fairly efficient, it burns clean and makes for a highly reusable engine, it burns relatively cool helping expand the lifespan of an engine, which again is good for reusability, it’s cheap and easy to produce and can be easily produced on the surface of Mars!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok yay! We’ve made it this far! Now that we have a strong grasp of how different engines operate and the fuels they might use, we can finally line them all up side by side and compare their metrics to help appreciate where each engine sits..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9826&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Engine-comparison-1-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Merlin engine vs raptor engine vs F-1 engine vs Be-4 vs RD-180 vs F-1 F1 aerojet SpaceX Blue Origin thrust to weight specific impulse chamber pressure fuel type cycle&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So now we’re going to line up engines by their fuel types and cycles. So let’s compare SpaceX’s open cycle Merlin engine that powers their Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, NPO Energomesh’s oxygen-rich closed cycle RD-180 that we see power the Atlas V rocket and Rocketdyne’s open cycle F-1 engine that powered the Saturn V which all run on RP-1. Then we have SpaceX’s full flow staged combustion cycle Raptor engine that will power their Starship and Super Heavy booster and Blue Origin’s closed cycle oxygen rich methane powered BE-4 engine that will power their New Glenn rocket and ULA’s upcoming Vulcan rocket, and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s closed cycle fuel rich RS-25 engine that powered the space shuttle and will power the upcoming SLS rocket which runs on Hydrogen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few quick notes here. The Raptor and BE-4 as of the making of this article are still in development, so the numbers we have are either in their current state of progress like the Raptor which is constantly improving and in the case of the BE-4, those are the target goals for the engine which Blue Origin has yet to hit. So just keep these numbers in mind that they’re subject to change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another fun note… look at the RD-180… now don’t be confused, this is a single engine, it just has two combustion chambers! There’s only a single turbo pump that splits its power to two combustion chambers.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The Soviet Union was able to solve the crazy hot oxygen rich closed cycle problem, but they were unable to solve combustion instability of large engines, so instead of one large combustion chamber, they made multiple small ones!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So first up, let’s take a look at their total thrust output at sea level since all these engines run at sea level, that’s a fair place to compare them. Let’s go from the least amount of thrust to the most, for fun ;)  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Merlin produces .84 MNs of thrust, the RS-25 produces 1.86 MNs, the Raptor currently is at 2 MNs, the BE-4 is hoping to hit 2.4 MNs, the RD-180 // 3.83 MNs ad the F-1 is still the king out of these at  6.77 MNs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayastronaut.com/shop&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9014&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ad-placement-1024x512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;space rocket merchandise spacex shirts shirt hats mug moon lamp light 3d printed grid fin not a coasters patch spaceflight merch swag shop webstore&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;512&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RD-170 actually produced more thrust than the F-1, but since it barely ever flew, I figured it wasn’t as relevant in this line up, figured it’s better to go with engines that have actually been used, a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thrust is great, but what’s maybe just as important when designing a rocket is the thrust to weight ratio… or how heavy the engine is compared to how much thrust it produces. A higher thrust to weight engine ultimately means less dead weight the rocket needs to lug around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s start from lowest to highest here. The lowest is actually the Space Shuttle’s RS-25 at 73:1, then there’s the RD-180 which is 78:1, then we have the BE-4 at around 80:1 but keep in mind, we don’t actually have a really good number on this, so there might be some wiggle room there, then the F-1 is 94:1, then we have the Raptor at 107:1 (for now), and lastly the Merlin is actually the leader here with an astonishing 198:1 thrust to weight ratio…. Yeah… that thing is a power house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thrust is great and all, but who cares how powerful an engine is if it’s terribly inefficient? So next up let’s check out their specific impulses, which is measured in seconds.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;For this we’ll show both the sea level specific impulse as well as the specific impulse in a vacuum. So starting with the least efficient engine which is the F-1 engine at 263 to 304 seconds, then the Merlin engine at 282 to 311 seconds, then we get the RD-180 at 311 to 338 seconds and somewhere in that same ballpark is the BE-4 which is AROUND 310 to 340 seconds, next up is the Raptor engine which is 330 to around 350 seconds, and lastly the king here by far is the RS-25 which is 366 to 452 seconds! WOAH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now one of the factors that affect both thrust and specific impulse is chamber pressure. Generally, the higher the chamber pressure, the more thrust and potentially more efficiency the engine can gain. Higher chamber pressures let an engine be smaller for a given thrust level, also improving their thrust to weight ratio.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The baby here is actually the F-1 which only had 70 bar in its chamber pressure. Now I do need to pause for a second and remind you 70 bar is 70 TIMES the atmospheric pressure… or the same amount of pressure you’d experience at 700 meters underwater… yikes… ok, so even the lowest chamber pressure is still mind boggling high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So next up is the Merlin engine at 97 bar, then the BE-4 will be around 135 ish, then the RS-25 which is 206 bar, then the RD-180 which has been considered the king of operational engines at 257 bar, that is until the Raptor is now online which is the new king of chamber pressure at a whopping 270 bars currently and they hope to get it up to 300 bar!!! 300 bar is like being 3 km deep in the ocean. I can’t even fathom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok, that’s enough of the specs of these engines, now lets look at their operational considerations. Starting with their approximate cost. Now, again, this can be kind of hard to nail down, so these are the best estimates I could come up with. These numbers do factor in inflation to make them all in today’s dollars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-9825&quot; src=&quot;https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Engine-comparison-2-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Merlin engine vs raptor engine vs F-1 engine vs Be-4 vs RD-180 vs F-1 F1 aerojet SpaceX Blue Origin price cost cost per flight reusable reusability reliability flight record&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s go with the most expensive and work our way down to the least expensive. The most expensive engine in this lineup is the RS-25 which has a sticker price of over $50 million per engine… yikes. Then we’ve got the F-1 engine which was $30 million per engine, then the RD-180 which is $25 million per engine, then the BE-4 which is around $8 million per engine, then we have the Merlin engine which is less than $1 million and for the Raptor, Elon has mentioned he thinks they can produce the Raptor for cheaper than or close to the Merlin engine if they can remove a lot of the complexity of the current versions… so for now, we’ll say around $2 million as a pretty decent ball park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well, cost is one thing, but another strong consideration for the cost of the engine is whether or not it’s reusable. And here only the RD-180 and the F-1 were not reusable, or at least never reused… which is different than all of these other engines which will all be reused multiple times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The RS-25 was reused over and over with the record being 19 flights out of a single engine, well after a few months of refurbishment… The Merlin is hoping to see up to 10 flights without major refurbishment. We know a design goal for the BE-4 is to be reused up to 25 times, and I think the Raptor hopes to see up to 50 flights, BUT, again, aspirations are one thing, we’ll see how history treats these claims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the topic of price, there’s actually some things that get really interesting when we start looking at these numbers. The first is a number Elon mentioned one interesting metric in a tweet in February of 2019 saying they hope to make the Raptor get better at their thrust to $ ratio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now this is a really interesting concept when you think about it. Who cares how much an engine costs if one big engine is cheaper than 2 smaller ones for the same thrust or vise versa. So let’s actually take a look at the $ to kN ratio of these engines.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Starting with the most expensive $ to kN engine which is the RS-25 at a crazy $26,881 : kN of thrust, then the RD-180 at $6,527 : 1 kN, followed by the F-1 at $4,431 : 1 kN, and then we get to the BE-4 which is $3,333 : 1 kN,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and then the Merlin at $1,170 and the Raptor at around $1,000 : kN.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;BUT NOW we can go even another step further since we know their $ / kN ratio but we also know their reusability potential… Now we can predict their potential cost per kN per flight, which changes based on how reusable the engines are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So for starters, since the RD-180 and the F-1 aren’t reusable, their price stays the same, but for the rest of the engines, if we take into account how many flights they have/will have, now we start to see the RS-25’s reusability pay off and close the gap, bringing it’s potential cost down to just $1,414 : kN, but here’s where things get crazy. Blue Origin’s BE-4 has potential to be truly game changing at around $133 : kN over 25 flights,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;which could make it about as cheap to operate than the Merlin at $117 per kN per flight.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But if the Raptor engine truly lives up to its hype, it could bring that number all the way down to $20 per kN per flight. Now that is absolutely game changing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure, money and reusability is a 21st century focus for spaceflight, but whatever happened to good old proven reliability? For this, let’s first look at how many operational flights each engine has had. At the moment of writing this, the Raptor and BE-4 haven’t seen any operational flights, although the Raptor is starting to leave the test stand and being used on test vehicles like the StarHopper. But for now neither engine has a real flight record.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Then we have the F-1 engine which was used on 17 flights, next up the Merlin engine which is at 71 flights and catching up quickly to the RD-180 which is at 79 flights, but the king out of these engines is the RS-25 which saw 135 flights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now lastly, how about reliability in service. Between the number of flights and this number, we can get a pretty good sense of how truly reliable an engine is. This number is really hard to just pin down since some engines may have shut down early but the mission was still successful on a few of these examples… so take these with a little grain of salt again.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Again, the BE-4 and Raptor haven’t flown yet, so those numbers are unavailable, then we have the Space Shuttle main engine which is over 99.5% reliable, but that gets hard to define when an engine doesn’t fully shut down…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;and then we have the Merlin at 99.9% reliable… it helps when you have 10 engines on each flight of the vehicle, and with only one engine ever failing in flight early on in its career, and despite that, the mission was still a success… so it’s a very reliable engine!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Now to end this, technically the RD-180 and the F-1 are 100% reliable, but with the F-1 never having any shut down at all in flight, it gets the bold here… and depending on how you define success and reliability, technically, the RD-180 is only kind of 100% reliable, because it got really really lucky once.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One time it shut down 6 seconds early, on an Atlas V mission in 2016, due to a faulty valve, but the mission went on to be a success because of some pure luck with the centaur upperstage having enough spare Delta V to carry out the mission! Had that valve failed even a second earlier and that mission would have failed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Man… seeing all of these numbers and considerations it makes you realize just how many variables go into designing a rocket. It’s so crazy to think about how if you tweak one little variable how many things that can affect. Change any one thing and it can have a massive ripple effect in the design and implementation of the vehicle as a whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s go back over all of this now that we know the cycles, the fuels and the aspirations of SpaceX to see if we can figure out why the Raptor engines exists and figure out if it’s worth all the effort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s look at SpaceX’s ultimate plan. Make a rapidly and fully reusable vehicle capable of sending humans to the Moon and Mars as inexpensively and routinely as possible. Not your everyday design goal for a rocket huh?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;In order to be rapidly and fully reusable, the engine needs to run clean and require low maintenance with simple turbopump seals and low preburner temperatures. Hmm, a Methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine sounds like a good fit….&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For reliability, redundancy and scale of manufacturing considerations, it makes sense to employ a lot of engines. In order to scale an engine down but maintain a high output, chamber pressure needs to be high… Hmm sounds like a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine sounds like a good fit…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For interplanetary trips, methane makes the most sense because it’s boiling point makes it usable on long duration trips to say Mars, which guess what, you can produce Methane on Mars… so for interplanetary trips, a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine sounds like a good fit…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Methane is fairly dense, meaning the tank size remains reasonable. Which again is good for interplanetary trips, not needing to lug around dead weight…  making a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine sounds like a good fit…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So… let’s bring it alllll back around now, is the Raptor engine really the king of rocket engines? Well, rocket science, like all things is a complex series of compromises. Is it the most efficient engine, no. Is it the most powerful engine, no. Is it the cheapest engine, probably not. Is it the most reusable engine, maybe. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But does it do everything really well? YES. It truly is a goldilocks engine, doing everything it needs to do very very well. It is the perfect fit for your interplanetary spaceship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And despite its complexity, SpaceX is developing this engine at a rapid pace. Knowing how much tweaking SpaceX did to their Merlin engine over a decade, we’re just at the infancy of the Raptor engine. It will only get better and better from here on out, which is crazy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So all in all, the Raptor engine IS the king of THIS application. It’s a fantastic engine to fufill SpaceX’s goals for their Starship vehicle. Would it be the king of other applications? Maybe, maybe not, and I’ll leave that decision for the rocket scientists and engineers who get to make all of those crazy compromises!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what do you think? Is it worth all the hassle to develop such a crazy and complex engine? Is this just the beginning for the Raptor engine? And most importantly, is the Raptor engine really the king of rocket engines? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Is SpaceX’s Raptor engine the king of rocket engines?</og:title>
<og:url>https://everydayastronaut.com/raptor-engine/</og:url>
<og:description>SpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before!Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX’s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle’s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.</og:description>

<title>How Screwed is Intel without Hyper-Threading?</title>
<link>https://www.techspot.com/article/1850-how-screwed-is-intel-no-hyper-threading/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techspot.com/article/1850-how-screwed-is-intel-no-hyper-threading/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As we've come to learn recently, there are four new hardware vulnerabilities that affect Intel processors. These new flaws allow attackers to leak confidential data by exploiting microarchitectural data sampling (MDS) side-channel vulnerabilities, of which the most serious is arguably 'ZombieLoad'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous speculative execution flaws that partially affected AMD and Arm-based processors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/news/80081-another-speculative-execution-exploit-affects-intel-core-cpus.html&quot;&gt;the MDS flaws&lt;/a&gt; are exclusive to Intel chips. In the short term the only way to mitigate or minimize these vulnerabilities is to disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or as Intel brands it &quot;Hyper-Threading.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands Microsoft is pushing out OS-level updates to address the four MDS vulnerabilities and you’ll get those with this month's Windows 10 1903 update. However, this doesn’t mitigate the problem entirely, for that we need motherboard BIOS updates and reportedly Intel has released the new microcode to motherboard partners. However as of writing no new BIOS revisions have been released to the public. We believe we can test a worst case scenario by disabling Hyper-Threading and for older platforms that won’t get updated this might end up being the only solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/images/2019-05-25-image-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/images/2019-05-25-image-2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, today we’re exploring the impact disabling Hyper-Threading has on Intel processors that support the feature. We’ve done this in the past and it’s an interesting test, however there is a new critical incentive to go over this data considering that Intel's latest hardware security vulnerability impacts SMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve grabbed a Core i7-8700K and 7700K and tested them in a battery of game and applications with and without Hyper-Threading enabled. We didn’t bother with the i9-9900K because it’s an 8-core part, so the missing threads won’t be an issue for gaming performance, though there'll still be a negative impact on application performance and that should be inline with what we see from the 8700K and 7700K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1497/images/Header_01.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1497/images/Header_01.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more ample time (we're about to head out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/tag/computex/&quot;&gt;Computex 2019&lt;/a&gt;, so watch out for our coverage) we would have liked to test some dual-core Hyper-Threading enabled Intel CPUs as the impact there will no doubt be brutal. Though we do have some older data we can fall back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed all tests using Windows 10 build 1903, we equipped the rigs with 32GB DDR4-3200 memory and a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti to reduce GPU bottlenecks. Gaming benchmarks were ran at both 1080p and 1440p, though we'll start with application benchmarks first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Application Benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off we have Cinebench R20 results and looking at the Core i7-8700K we see a 24% reduction in performance with Hyper-Threading disabled. Naturally that kind of performance drop won’t go unnoticed. Furthermore in terms of performance we’re essentially turning the 8700K into a 7700K, so a fair old downgrade that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the 7700K becomes 26% slower with Hyper-Threading disabled and now we have a plain old quad-core, or a Core i5 of the Kaby Lake generation. For applications that heavily leverage all cores, disabling SMT/Hyper-Threading has a big impact on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/CB20.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WinRAR sees a massive 36% reduction in throughput for the 8700K. Clearly Hyper-Threading works very well for this type of workload. Likewise we see a massive drop off for the 7700K, a 39% reduction in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/WinRAR.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corona is a high performance renderer and here the 8700K saw a 31% performance decrease with Hyper-Threading disabled, while the 7700K saw a similar 33% drop off. In both cases the performance decrease is significant, signaling we could see considerable performance drop offs in rendering and encoding tasks depending on how the updates to mitigate the flaws work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Corona.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blender sees a smaller 25% drop off for the 8700K with Hyper-Threading disabled, which is closer to what we saw on Cinebench R20, though it's still significant. The 7700K with fewer cores does suffer a little more and here we see a 29% performance reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Blender.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Power Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we move on to gaming we wanted to note total system power consumption. Granted we’re not looking at individual processor consumption, so it’s hard to comment on efficiency, but as you can see disabling Hyper-Threading on the 8700K doesn’t save us much power in this test with a ~5% reduction in total system usage. The 7700K was better leveraged with HT enabled and here we saw an 11% reduction which is probably more in line with the performance drop off we saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Power.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gaming Benchmarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up are 1080p results for Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. Here the 8700K only saw a 13% reduction for the average frame rate and no change to the 1% low. The 7700K on the other hand with its fewer cores saw a massive reduction for both the average frame rate and 1% low results. Here we saw a 23% drop off for the average frame rate and 21% for the 1% low. Those with quad-core processors will be impacted significantly more by a reduction in Hyper-Threading performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/ACO_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you’re primarily GPU bound the 8700K does fine with Hyper-Threading disabled as we see at 1440p, even with an RTX 2080 Ti. Those with quad-cores and god forbid dual-cores, any reduction in Hyper-Threading efficiency is going to sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/ACO_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battlefield V is a very CPU intensive title though for this content we only had time to test the single player portion of the game and even then we needed two Origin accounts thanks to the delightful hardware change lockout. Keeping on subject, we don’t see much of a performance decline here. The biggest drop off was up to 12% when looking at the 1% low margins for the 7700K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/BFV_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the resolution to 1440p didn’t help with the 1% low performance and we see in both instances disabling Hyper-Threading does reduce performance though the gap is not as large as with saw on productivity workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/BFV_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Division 2's results are brutal. Look at the performance drop on the 7700K with Hyper-Threading disabled. The average frame rate is reduced by 37% and the 1% low result by 38%, close to what we saw on WinRAR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Division_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance impact for the 6-core 8700K isn’t nearly as extreme, but even so a 13% dip in 1% low performance won’t be appreciated by most gamers. Moving to 1440p and now the 8700K even with Hyper-Threading disabled isn’t the performance limiting component, that would be the RTX 2080 Ti. However we’re still seeing a 32% reduction for the 7700K when looking at 1% low performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Division_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little side note. Far Cry New Dawn plays better on the 9700K than it does the 8700K. The 9700K allows for ~120 fps on average at 1080p. We bring this up because when we disable Hyper-Threading the 8700K matches the 9700K in this test, so basically 6-cores/6-threads is more efficient in this title than 6-core with 12-threads and you see that quite a bit with games when testing SMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/FC_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said the 7700K with its fewer cores doesn’t suffer the same issue with Hyper-Threading enabled, though it was still a smidgen faster with it disabled. So at least for this game running without Hyper-Threading is a non-issue and in fact is likely going to be beneficial, though not if you have a dual-core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to 1440p and we see that core count isn’t an issue here, it’s actually Hyper-Threading that’s slowing down the 7700K and 8700K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/FC_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on we have Hitman 2 and here we see that disabling Hyper-Threading has no real impact for the 8700K, however for the quad-core 7700K it is devastating. The average frame rate dropped by 18% but far worse, almost a 30% reduction in 1% low performance. Granted we’re still seeing over 60 fps at all times, but for those chasing big frame rates this kind of performance hit is harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Hitman_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at 1440p the 7700K is hit hard with Hyper-Threading disabled as we still see over a 25% reduction in 1% low performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Hitman_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we have Rage 2 where the 8700K saw almost no decline in performance with Hyper-Threading disabled. On the 7700K the average frame rate is virtually unchanged, but the 1% low drops by a significant 20% margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Rage_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we increase the resolution to 1440p in Rage 2 that’s enough to remove the CPU as the performance limiting component, at least when looking at the Hyper-Threading-less 7700K. So here disabling Hyper-Threading has no impact on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/Rage_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen in the past just how demanding Shadow of the Tomb Raider can be and we’re getting a reminder of that here. The 8700K saw a 10-12% performance drop off with Hyper-Threading disabled while the 7700K saw a 24% drop off, though the 1% low margins were similar to what we witnessed with the 8700K. In either case disabling SMT does have a big impact in this title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/SotTR_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at 1440p the effect is significant, at least for the 7700K. The 8700K still saw a small performance decline but it was nothing like the 20% drop off the 7700K suffered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/SotTR_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last up we have some World War Z results using the low-level Vulkan API. Here the game runs just fine with 4 cores, so neither CPU suffers when Hyper-Threading is disabled. We see something similar at 1440p as both CPUs are able to extract maximum performance from the RTX 2080 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/WWZ_1080p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1850/bench/WWZ_1440p.png&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a pretty good idea of how Intel’s 4 and 6-core CPUs perform with Hyper-Threading enabled versus disabled. To quickly summarize the results, core heavy application performance was typically reduced anywhere from 25-35%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact on gaming performance can vary significantly depending on the game and other factors such as the resolution, visual quality settings, and of course, the accompanying GPU. For the games we tested, with a 6-core Intel CPU you will see minimal impact on performance for the most part, though 1% performance does suffer at times and on high refresh rate gaming you’ll notice the performance drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1497/images/Image_07.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/1497/images/Image_07.jpg&quot; class=&quot;b-lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those with an 8-core/16-thread part like the 9900K the impact on gaming will be virtually non-existent, though application performance will still see a 25-35% drop without SMT. On the other hand, lower-end CPUs that rely on Hyper-Threading more heavily will see the most substantial performance loss. Even the quad-core 7700K often suffered large performance dips in gaming tests and this means the loss of Hyper-Threading will be even more devastating for those with dual-core SMT enabled parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now we can't exactly say how much of an impact the four MDS mitigations will have on performance (for Windows PCs), but we can anticipate there will be some hit, and we know it'll be felt most where Hyper-Threading has the biggest impact. Phoronix has tested the mitigations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;amp;item=mds-zombieload-mit&amp;amp;num=1&quot;&gt;on Linux&lt;/a&gt; and the performance hit ranges from negligible to massive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;amp;item=mds-zombieload-mit&amp;amp;num=10&quot;&gt;Phoronix&lt;/a&gt; also found that Intel systems are now ~16% slower out of the box than they were before the Spectre, Meltdown, Foreshadow and Zombieload mitigations. Meanwhile AMD has only seen a 3% performance drop. They also argue the mitigation impact is enough to draw the Core i7-8700K much &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/review/1655-core-i7-8700k-vs-ryzen-7-2700x/&quot;&gt;closer to the Ryzen 7 2700X&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/review/1493-intel-core-i9-7980xe-and-7960x/&quot;&gt;Core i9-7980XE&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techspot.com/review/1680-threadripper-2-mega-tasking/&quot;&gt;Threadripper 2990WX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless Intel can pull a rabbit out of a hat and make mitigations so effective that Hyper-Threading is left untouched, this could have disastrous consequences for those using dual and quad-core Intel CPUs that support Hyper-Threading. This includes Core i3 and Core i5 processors from Clarkdale to Kaby Lake, Core i7s up to Kaby Lake, as well as Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake Pentium processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those using older hardware and not running any mission critical tasks, until attacks based on these exploits are clearly defined, perhaps the best performance option will be not to update. This is not our official recommendation but color commentary on what could be an alternative route once the corresponding updates are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article made for an interesting study of where Hyper-Threading makes the biggest difference and while this shows a worst case scenario where SMT has to be thrown completely out of the picture, we've seen some moves in that direction. Google turned off Hyper-Threading in Chrome OS, the OpenBSD community recommends the same, while Apple has patched systems with partial mitigations and disclosed that full mitigation requires disabling Hyper-Threading. Other vendors like Microsoft have not taken a definitive stance yet.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Today we're exploring the impact disabling Hyper-Threading has on Intel processors. We've done this in the past and it's an interesting test, however there are new incentives to check this out due to the newly discovered side-channel vulnerabilities affecting Intel processors and their impact on Hyper-Threading.</og:description>

<title>In Baltimore and Beyond, a Stolen NSA Tool Wreaks Havoc</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/nsa-hacking-tool-baltimore.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/us/nsa-hacking-tool-baltimore.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For nearly three weeks, Baltimore has struggled with a cyberattack by digital extortionists that has frozen thousands of computers, shut down email and disrupted real estate sales, water bills, health alerts and many other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But here is what frustrated city employees and residents do not know: A key component of the malware that cybercriminals used in the attack was developed at taxpayer expense a short drive down the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at the National Security Agency, according to security experts briefed on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since 2017, when &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the N.S.A. lost control of the tool&lt;/a&gt;, EternalBlue, it has been picked up by state hackers in North Korea, Russia and, more recently, China, to cut a path of destruction around the world, leaving billions of dollars in damage. But over the past year, the cyberweapon has boomeranged back and is now showing up in the N.S.A.’s own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is not just in Baltimore. Security experts say EternalBlue attacks &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/17/eternalblue-new-heights-wannacryptor/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have reached a high&lt;/a&gt;, and cybercriminals are zeroing in on vulnerable American towns and cities, from Pennsylvania to Texas, paralyzing local governments and driving up costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The N.S.A. connection to the attacks on American cities has not been previously reported, in part because the agency has refused to discuss or even acknowledge the loss of its cyberweapon, dumped online in April 2017 by a still-unidentified group calling itself &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/hal-martin-nsa-guilty-plea.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the Shadow Brokers&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, the agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation still do not know whether the Shadow Brokers are foreign spies or disgruntled insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Thomas Rid, a cybersecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, called the Shadow Brokers episode “the most destructive and costly N.S.A. breach in history,” more damaging than the better-known leak in 2013 from Edward Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The government has refused to take responsibility, or even to answer the most basic questions,” Mr. Rid said. “Congressional oversight appears to be failing. The American people deserve an answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The N.S.A. and F.B.I. declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Since that leak, foreign intelligence agencies and rogue actors have used EternalBlue to spread malware that has paralyzed hospitals, airports, rail and shipping operators, A.T.M.s and factories that produce critical vaccines. Now the tool is hitting the United States where it is most vulnerable, in local governments with aging digital infrastructure and fewer resources to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;On May 7, city workers in Baltimore had their computers frozen by hackers. Officials have refused to pay the $100,000 ransom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Before it leaked, EternalBlue was one of the most useful exploits in the N.S.A.’s cyberarsenal. According to three former N.S.A. operators who spoke on the condition of anonymity, analysts spent almost a year finding a flaw in Microsoft’s software and writing the code to target it. Initially, they referred to it as EternalBluescreen because it often crashed computers — a risk that could tip off their targets. But it went on to become a reliable tool used in countless intelligence-gathering and counterterrorism missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;EternalBlue was so valuable, former N.S.A. employees said, that the agency never seriously considered alerting Microsoft about the vulnerabilities, and held on to it for more than five years before the breach forced its hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/baltimore-ransomware.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Baltimore attack&lt;/a&gt;, on May 7, was a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/atlanta-cyberattack-ransom.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;classic ransomware&lt;/a&gt; assault. City workers’ screens suddenly locked, and a message in flawed English demanded about $100,000 in Bitcoin to free their files: “We’ve watching you for days,” said the message, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-ci-it-outage-20190507-story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;obtained by The Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;. “We won’t talk more, all we know is MONEY! Hurry up!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Today, Baltimore remains handicapped as city officials refuse to pay, though workarounds have restored some services. Without EternalBlue, the damage would not have been so vast, experts said. The tool exploits a vulnerability in unpatched software that allows hackers to spread their malware faster and farther than they otherwise could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;North Korea was the first nation to co-opt the tool, for an attack in 2017 — called WannaCry — that paralyzed the British health care system, German railroads and some 200,000 organizations around the world. Next was Russia, which used the weapon in an attack — called NotPetya — that was aimed at Ukraine but spread across major companies doing business in the country. The assault cost FedEx more than $400 million and Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, $670 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The damage didn’t stop there. In the past year, the same Russian hackers who targeted the 2016 American presidential election used EternalBlue to compromise hotel Wi-Fi networks. Iranian hackers have used it to spread ransomware and hack airlines in the Middle East, according to researchers at the security firms Symantec and FireEye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s incredible that a tool which was used by intelligence services is now publicly available and so widely used,” said Vikram Thakur, Symantec’s director of security response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One month before the Shadow Brokers began dumping the agency’s tools online in 2017, the N.S.A. — aware of the breach — reached out to Microsoft and other tech companies to inform them of their software flaws. Microsoft released a patch, but hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide remain unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Hackers seem to have found a sweet spot in Baltimore, Allentown, Pa., San Antonio and other local, American governments, where public employees oversee tangled networks that often use out-of-date software. Last July, the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-201A&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Department of Homeland Security issued a dire warning&lt;/a&gt; that state and local governments were getting hit by particularly destructive malware that now, security researchers say, has started relying on EternalBlue to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft, which tracks the use of EternalBlue, would not name the cities and towns affected, citing customer privacy. But other experts briefed on the attacks in Baltimore, Allentown and San Antonio confirmed the hackers used EternalBlue. Security responders said they were seeing EternalBlue pop up in attacks almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amit Serper, head of security research at Cybereason, said his firm had responded to EternalBlue attacks at three different American universities, and found vulnerable servers in major cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The costs can be hard for local governments to bear. The Allentown attack, in February last year, disrupted city services for weeks and cost about $1 million to remedy — plus another $420,000 a year for new defenses, said Matthew Leibert, the city’s chief information officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He described the package of dangerous computer code that hit Allentown as “commodity malware,” sold on the dark web and used by criminals who don’t have specific targets in mind. “There are warehouses of kids overseas firing off phishing emails,” Mr. Leibert said, like thugs shooting military-grade weapons at random targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The malware that hit San Antonio last September infected a computer inside Bexar County sheriff’s office and tried to spread across the network using EternalBlue, according to two people briefed on the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This past week, researchers at the security firm Palo Alto Networks discovered that a Chinese state group, Emissary Panda, had hacked into Middle Eastern governments using EternalBlue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You can’t hope that once the initial wave of attacks is over, it will go away,” said Jen Miller-Osborn, a deputy director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks. “We expect EternalBlue will be used almost forever, because if attackers find a system that isn’t patched, it is so useful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Adm. Michael S. Rogers, who led the N.S.A. during the leak, has said the agency should not be blamed for the trail of damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Erin Schaff for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Until a decade or so ago, the most powerful cyberweapons belonged almost exclusively to intelligence agencies — N.S.A. officials used the term “NOBUS,” for “nobody but us,” for vulnerabilities only the agency had the sophistication to exploit. But that advantage has hugely eroded, not only because of the leaks, but because anyone can grab a cyberweapon’s code once it’s used in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some F.B.I. and Homeland Security officials, speaking privately, said more accountability at the N.S.A. was needed. A former F.B.I. official likened the situation to a government failing to lock up a warehouse of automatic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In an interview in March, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, who was director of the N.S.A. during the Shadow Brokers leak, suggested in unusually candid remarks that the agency should not be blamed for the long trail of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If Toyota makes pickup trucks and someone takes a pickup truck, welds an explosive device onto the front, crashes it through a perimeter and into a crowd of people, is that Toyota’s responsibility?” he asked. “The N.S.A. wrote an exploit that was never designed to do what was done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., where thousands of security engineers have found themselves on the front lines of these attacks, executives reject that analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I disagree completely,” said Tom Burt, the corporate vice president of consumer trust, insisting that cyberweapons could not be compared to pickup trucks. “These exploits are developed and kept secret by governments for the express purpose of using them as weapons or espionage tools. They’re inherently dangerous. When someone takes that, they’re not strapping a bomb to it. It’s already a bomb.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, has called for a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/#sm.0001gnysbhjsod01z7q11hvz0xg2d&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Digital Geneva Convention”&lt;/a&gt; to govern cyberspace, including a pledge by governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather than keeping them secret to exploit for espionage or attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Last year, Microsoft, along with Google and Facebook, joined 50 countries in signing on to a similar call by French President Emmanuel Macron — the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace — to end “malicious cyber activities in peacetime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-18icg9x evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Notably absent from the signatories were the world’s most aggressive cyberactors: China, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia — and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GDPR After One Year</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://truthonthemarket.com/2019/05/24/gdpr-after-one-year-costs-and-unintended-consequences/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;18897&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://truthonthemarket.com/2019/05/24/gdpr-after-one-year-costs-and-unintended-consequences/05onfire1_xp-articlelarge-v2/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2.jpg?fit=600%2C284&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;600,284&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2.jpg?fit=300%2C142&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2.jpg?fit=580%2C275&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; src=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2.jpg?w=580&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-18897&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i2.wp.com/truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2.jpg?w=600&amp;amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/05onfire1_xp-articleLarge-v2.jpg?resize=300%2C142&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDPR is officially one year old. How have the first 12 months gone? As you can see from the mix of data and anecdotes below, it appears that compliance costs have been astronomical; individual “data rights” have led to unintended consequences; “privacy protection” seems to have undermined market competition; and there have been large unseen — but not unmeasurable! — costs in foregone startup investment. So, all-in-all, about what we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GDPR cases and fines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2019/1-year-gdpr-taking-stock_en&quot;&gt;the latest data&lt;/a&gt; on cases and fines released by the European Data Protection Board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;€55,955,871 in fines
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;€50 million of which was a single fine on Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;281,088 total cases
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;144,376 complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;89,271 data breach notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47,441 other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.0% ongoing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.9% closed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.1% appealed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unintended consequences of new data privacy rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR can be thought of as a privacy “bill of rights.” Many of these new rights have come with unintended consequences. If your account gets hacked, the hacker can use the right of access to get all of your data. The right to be forgotten is in conflict with the public’s right to know a bad actor’s history (and many of them are using the right to memory hole their misdeeds). The right to data portability creates another attack vector for hackers to exploit. And the right to opt-out of data collection creates a free-rider problem where users who opt-in subsidize the privacy of those who opt-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itif.org/publications/2018/11/19/venture-capital-invested-eu-technology-firms-has-fallen-more-50-percent-gdpr&quot;&gt;Article 15&lt;/a&gt;: Right of access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Amazon sent 1,700 Alexa voice recordings to the wrong user following data request” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150531/amazon-alexa-voice-recordings-wrong-user-gdpr-privacy-ai&quot;&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Today I discovered an unfortunate consequence of GDPR: once someone hacks into your account, they can request-—and potentially access—all of your data. Whoever hacked into my Spotify account got all of my streaming, song, etc. history simply by requesting it.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeanqasaur/status/1039435801736536064?lang=en&quot;&gt;Jean Yang&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-17-right-to-erasure-'right-to-be-forgotten'-GDPR.htm&quot;&gt;Article 17&lt;/a&gt;: Right to be forgotten&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Since 2016, newspapers in Belgium and Italy have removed articles from their archives under [GDPR]. Google was also ordered last year to stop listing some search results, including information from 2014 about a Dutch doctor who The Guardian reported was suspended for poor care of a patient.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/technology/europe-tech-censorship.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“French scam artist Michael Francois Bujaldon is using the GDPR to attempt to remove traces of his United States District Court case from the internet. He has already succeeded in compelling PacerMonitor to remove his case.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180921190848/https:/twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1040601203640397824&quot;&gt;PlainSite&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“In the last 5 days, we’ve had requests under GDPR to delete three separate articles … all about US lawsuits concerning scams committed by Europeans. That ‘right to be forgotten’ is working out just great, huh guys?” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mmasnick/status/1049704101427142656&quot;&gt;Mike Masnick&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-20-right-to-data-portability-GDPR.htm&quot;&gt;Article 20&lt;/a&gt;: Right to data portability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data portability increases the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface&quot;&gt;attack surface&lt;/a&gt; for bad actors to exploit. In a sense, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt; was a case of &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; data portability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The problem with data portability is that it goes both ways: if you can take your data out of Facebook to other applications, you can do the same thing in the other direction. The question, then, is which entity is likely to have the greater center of gravity with regards to data: Facebook, with its social network, or practically anything else?” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/&quot;&gt;Ben Thompson&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Presumably data portability would be imposed on Facebook’s competitors and potential competitors as well.  That would mean all future competing firms would have to slot their products into a Facebook-compatible template.  Let’s say that 17 years from now someone has a virtual reality social network innovation: does it have to be “exportable” into Facebook and other competitors?  It’s hard to think of any better way to stifle innovation.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/05/forced-data-portability-mistake.html&quot;&gt;Tyler Cowen&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-21-right-to-object-GDPR.htm&quot;&gt;Article 21&lt;/a&gt;: Right to opt out of data processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“[B]y restricting companies from limiting services or increasing prices for consumers who opt-out of sharing personal data, these frameworks enable free riders—individuals that opt out but still expect the same services and price—and undercut access to free content and services.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.itif.org/2019-grand-bargain-privacy.pdf&quot;&gt;ITIF&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compliance costs are astronomical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prior to GDPR going into effect, it was estimated that total GDPR compliance costs for US firms with more than 500 employees “could reach $150 billion.” (&lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/gdpr-compliant-privacy-facebook-google-analytics-policy-deadline/&quot;&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another estimate from the same time said 75,000 Data Protection Officers would need to be hired for compliance. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://iapp.org/news/a/study-gdprs-global-reach-to-require-at-least-75000-dpos-worldwide/&quot;&gt;IAPP&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of March 20, 2019, 1,129 US news sites are still unavailable in the EU due to GDPR. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://data.verifiedjoseph.com/dataset/websites-not-available-eu-gdpr&quot;&gt;Joseph O’Connor&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft had 1,600 engineers working on compliance. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/05/21/microsofts-commitment-to-gdpr-privacy-and-putting-customers-in-control-of-their-own-data/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a Senate hearing, Keith Enright, Google’s chief privacy officer, estimated that the company spent “hundreds of years of human time” to comply with the new privacy rules. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1403080/google-spent-hundreds-of-years-of-human-time-complying-with-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, French authorities ultimately decided Google’s compliance efforts were insufficient: “France fines Google nearly $57 million for first major violation of new European privacy regime” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/france-fines-google-nearly-57-million-for-first-major-violation-of-new-european-privacy-regime/2019/01/21/89e7ee08-1d8f-11e9-a759-2b8541bbbe20_story.html?utm_term=.78649e1683dc&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“About 220,000 name tags will be removed in Vienna by the end of [2018], the city’s housing authority said. Officials fear that they could otherwise be fined up to $23 million, or about $1,150 per name.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/19/europes-privacy-laws-are-now-so-tough-they-are-taking-names-off-doorbells-vienna/?utm_term=.a9c79d84967e&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tradeoff between privacy regulations and market competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the big guys increasing market share? I don’t believe [the law] will have such a consequence.” Věra Jourová, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-europes-new-privacy-rules-favor-google-and-facebook-1524536324&quot;&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mentioned GDPR to the head of a European media company. ‘Gift to Google and Facebook, enormous regulatory own-goal.'” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1027634293290352641?lang=en&quot;&gt;Benedict Evans&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Hundreds of companies compete to place ads on webpages or collect data on their users, led by Google, Facebook and their subsidiaries. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May, imposes stiff requirements on such firms and the websites who use them. &lt;strong&gt;After the rule took effect in May, Google’s tracking software appeared on slightly more websites, Facebook’s on 7% fewer, while the smallest companies suffered a 32% drop&lt;/strong&gt;, according to Ghostery, which develops privacy-enhancing web technology.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/beware-the-big-tech-backlash-11545227197&quot;&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Havas SA, one of the world’s largest buyers of ads, says it observed &lt;strong&gt;a low double-digit percentage increase in advertisers’ spending through DBM on Google’s own ad exchange&lt;/strong&gt; on the first day the law went into effect, according to Hossein Houssaini, Havas’s global head of programmatic solutions. On the selling side, companies that help publishers sell ad inventory have seen declines in bids coming through their platforms from Google. Paris-based Smart says it has seen a roughly 50% drop. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-strict-new-privacy-law-is-sending-more-ad-money-to-google-1527759001&quot;&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The consequence was that just hours after the law’s enforcement, &lt;strong&gt;numerous independent ad exchanges and other vendors watched their ad demand volumes drop between 20 and 40 percent.&lt;/strong&gt; But with agencies free to still buy demand on Google’s marketplace, demand on AdX spiked. The fact that Google’s compliance strategy has ended up hurting its competitors and redirecting higher demand back to its own marketplace, where it can guarantee it has user consent, has unsettled publishers and ad tech vendors.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/media/google-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-strafing-ad-sellers/&quot;&gt;Digiday&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unseen costs of foregone investment &amp;amp; research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startups&lt;/strong&gt;: One study estimated that venture capital invested in EU startups fell by as much as 50 percent due to GDPR implementation. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w25248&quot;&gt;NBER&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mergers and acquisitions&lt;/strong&gt;: “55% of respondents said they had worked on deals that fell apart because of concerns about a target company’s data protection policies and compliance with GDPR” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2018/11/13/data-protection-concerns-upend-ma-plans/&quot;&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific research&lt;/strong&gt;: “[B]iomedical researchers fear that the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will make it harder to share information across borders or outside their original research context.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/cancer-5-big-reasons-europe-sucks-at-curing/&quot;&gt;POLITICO&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;GDPR has been the death knell for small and medium-sized businesses&lt;/h2&gt;

<og:title>GDPR After One Year: Costs and Unintended Consequences - Truth on the Market</og:title>
<og:description>GDPR is officially one year old. How have the first 12 months gone? As you can see from the mix of data and anecdotes below, it appears that compliance costs have been astronomical; individual “data rights” have led to unintended consequences; “privacy protection” seems to have undermined market competition; and there have been large unseen …</og:description>
