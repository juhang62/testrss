<description>&lt;p class=&quot;has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading&quot;&gt;In a press conference on Tuesday, Chad Wolf, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, responded to media reports that unidentified federal agents using unmarked vehicles have been arresting protesters in Portland, Oregon. Since early July, men in military-style uniforms have &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/07/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-battle-of-portland/?fbclid=IwAR38KWr9nfpyOEx7syu5u5M7im6p2YLcPeIvZGlniS7ErH5jUjV6SR8SNQs&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/07/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-battle-of-portland/?fbclid=IwAR38KWr9nfpyOEx7syu5u5M7im6p2YLcPeIvZGlniS7ErH5jUjV6SR8SNQs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waged battle&lt;/a&gt; against protesters there, using tear gas and nonlethal munitions; video and photographs coming out of Portland have shown scenes of urban warfare, with what looks like a regular army moving on unarmed protesters night after night. On behalf of the D.H.S. and its uniformed services, Wolf claimed responsibility for the armed presence in Portland. He asserted that his agency was doing exactly what it was created to do. He was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale for the creation of the D.H.S., as laid out by the George W. Bush Administration, was that the knowledge, skills, and capabilities that could have stopped the 9/11 attacks were spread out among many government agencies, with no single body in charge of fighting terrorism. The proposal for creating the department presented hypothetical examples of failures to coördinate among different agencies. When a ship sailed into U.S. waters, for instance, the Coast Guard had the power to stop it for inspection, but it was up to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deal with the people on board, and up to Customs and Border Protection or the Department of Agriculture to stop any dangerous or illegal cargo. The examples made D.H.S. seem like something that should exist. That logic held, though, only if you thought about travel, immigration, and trade primarily as security concerns. There are countries that think like that. I grew up in one—it was called the Soviet Union, and it had an agency, the Committee for State Security (K.G.B.), which had its tentacles in every area of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of the D.H.S. marked a shift in the way that Americans think and talk about the country, and about people. Four years ago, in an &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/magazine/the-dark-history-of-defending-the-homeland.html&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/magazine/the-dark-history-of-defending-the-homeland.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the journalist James Traub traced the appearance and evolution of the word “homeland” in American language. “The rise of ‘homeland’ … tracks the rise of the national sense of vulnerability,” Traub wrote. “As we use it now, ‘homeland’ means ‘the country insofar as it is endangered.’ ” The word had surfaced in 1997, in a Pentagon report warning that the singular threat to U.S. security, which the Soviet Union once posed, had been replaced by a diffuse threat from different sources. By 2001, “homeland” had sudden traction—it was a word that had found its meaning. By the time Traub was writing, in 2016, all of the contenders for the Republican nomination for President—a group in which Donald Trump may have still seemed an outlier—were trafficking in fear for the land. “Homeland” is also a nativist term: it refers to the country where you were born, or else it comes with the qualifier “adopted,” which suggests that your claim to the homeland is contingent. (Sure enough, under Trump, the federal government has moved toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/in-america-naturalized-citizens-no-longer-have-an-assumption-of-permanence&quot;&gt;seeing naturalized citizen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;ship as revocable&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Homeland” is an anxious, combative word: it denotes a place under assault, in need of aggressive defense from shape-shifting dangers. The original proposal for the D.H.S. described the agency as “a new government structure to protect against invisible enemies that can strike with a wide variety of weapons”; one hypothetical example of an invisible enemy was “a non-citizen that intends to enter our nation and attack one of our chemical facilities.” The nation used to protect itself against other nations and their hostile military forces, but now it had to fear individuals. This is the premise on which secret police forces are built. Their stated purpose is to find danger where normal human activity appears to be taking place. The D.H.S. began with mobilizing against the foreign-born, via Immigration and Customs Enforcement (which replaced the Immigration and Naturalization Service). The logic of the secret police, however, dictates that it perpetually has to look in new places for threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Bush signed the Homeland Security Act, in November of 2002, bringing the D.H.S. into existence, he &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?174002-1/homeland-security-act-signing&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?174002-1/homeland-security-act-signing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; it as “the most extensive reorganization of the federal government since Harry Truman signed the National Security Act,” and spoke of “ruthless killers who move and plot in shadows.” He promised, “We’re on the hunt. One person at a time.” Bush’s words echoed the promise that fuelled Vladimir Putin’s rise in Russia. In a speech that brought him to sudden prominence, in 1999, the former K.G.B. colonel promised to “hunt down” terrorists and “snuff them out in the outhouse,” if that’s where they happened to be found. The secret police, even when it looks and appears to act like an army, always has a single individual as its target. Its goal is to make a person, alone, face the might of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Portland, the men in military-style uniforms have been picking up and detaining individuals while they are walking alone, often after a protest ends. At the press conference on Tuesday, Wolf owned the tactic of tracking people down and picking them up at some distance from protests. “When you have five hundred, six hundred violent individuals, violent criminals across the street from you, trying to inflict harm on your property and at law-enforcement officers … we don’t go into that crowd,” he said. “We don’t try to go into a violent crowd of four hundred people and try to arrest people—that’s dangerous.” Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, explained that his troops were using unmarked vehicles because police vehicles in other cities had been attacked by protesters; similarly, he said, his men didn’t have their names on their uniforms for fear of attacks on their homes and families. The C.B.P. is the largest law-enforcement agency in the country. Its leader—who at the same briefing stated that his troops are highly trained and experienced in putting down riots—and his boss, Chad Wolf, were telling the nation that they are terrified of the protesters. These men represent a government agency born of fear. Their tactics are designed to engender an equal amount of fear in the people they see as their enemies. The secret police is always a terror-production machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan has been running the C.B.P. since July of last year; Wolf has been at the head of the D.H.S. since November. Both men have the word “acting” before their titles, because neither has been confirmed by the Senate. A recent lawsuit filed by advocates for asylum seekers alleges that Wolf is occupying his post illegally, because a federal statute called the Vacancies Act places a two-hundred-and-ten-day limit on the tenure of an “acting” officer. The Stanford law professor Anne Joseph O’Connell, who has &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://columbialawreview.org/content/actings/&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://columbialawreview.org/content/actings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s use of “acting” officials—he has employed more of them, and for longer, than past Presidents—told me via e-mail that Wolf’s appointment was made in violation of a different federal statute, the Homeland Security Act. (The same point has been &lt;a class=&quot;external-link&quot; data-event-click=&quot;{&amp;quot;element&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ExternalLink&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;outgoingURL&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/top-democrats-call-for-emergency-review-of-dhs-appointments&amp;quot;}&quot; href=&quot;https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/top-democrats-call-for-emergency-review-of-dhs-appointments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raised&lt;/a&gt; by top congressional Democrats, who last year called for an emergency review of D.H.S. appointments.) Under the Vacancies Act, some actions of an illegitimately appointed secretary would be null and void. No one knows, however, how this restriction could be enforced, or what the consequences might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we learn more about what is happening in Portland—as footage of federal troops waging war on protesters floods social media, and as the President threatens to send his foot soldiers to other large cities—we are watching the perfect and perhaps inevitable combination of a domestic-security superagency and a President who rejects all mechanisms of accountability, including the Senate confirmation process. What we are also seeing is a perfect storm of fear: the legacy of fear cultivated in the wake of 9/11, and the fear that Trump campaigned on in 2016 and continues to campaign on now.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: A simple CLI tool to generate satellite images of a location</title>
<link>https://github.com/plant99/felicette</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/plant99/felicette</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery for dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who should use this tool?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Generate JPEG earth imagery from coordinates/location name with publicly available satellite data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool is for a sentient being who wants to view high-res satellite imagery of earth, without digging through all the nitty gritty geospatial details of it. So if this is your first time trying to explore how parts of the Earth look from space, you're at the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NB: &lt;code&gt;felicette&lt;/code&gt; at the present state searches for cloud-cover &amp;lt; 10%, and doesn't constrain results on the basis of dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/plant99/felicette/wiki/Product-Roadmap&quot;&gt;Product Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; for upcoming features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;felicette&lt;/code&gt; depends on GDAL. But the following steps cover GDAL's installation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rio-color&lt;/code&gt; uses numpy headers to setup, thus installing numpy and GDAL=={ogrinfo --version} would be sufficient before installing felicette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Debian&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy gdal-bin libgdal-dev
$ gdal-config --version
 &amp;lt;version-number&amp;gt;
 
* activate virtual environment *

$ pip install numpy GDAL==&amp;lt;version-number&amp;gt;
$ pip install felicette

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;MacOS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ brew install gdal
$ gdal-config --version
 &amp;lt;version-number&amp;gt;

* activate virtual environment *

$ pip install numpy GDAL==&amp;lt;version-number&amp;gt;
$ pip install felicette
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Docker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23951167&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the following docker image works and is volume-mapped to the present working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ docker run -it -v &quot;$PWD&quot;/felicette-data:/root/felicette-data milhouse1337/felicette felicette -l &quot;Montreal&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/u/milhouse1337&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@milhouse1337&lt;/a&gt; for the docker-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;Why you no make a section for Windows?&quot; :|&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;rio-color&lt;/code&gt;, one of the felicette's dependencies isn't available on conda ecosystem yet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox/rio-color/issues/58#issuecomment-406466990&quot;&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; the link to a small discussion on an installation-issue. This section would be updated when there is a stable version of &lt;code&gt;felicette&lt;/code&gt; for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felicette has plans to build in-house RGB image enhancement algorithms or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;imagemagick&lt;/a&gt; /[similar tools on conda-forge] for a Windows release, at least until &lt;code&gt;rio-color&lt;/code&gt; is available on conda-forge/conda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ felicette --help
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Usage: felicette [OPTIONS]

  Satellite imagery for dummies.

Options:
  -c, --coordinates FLOAT...  Coordinates in (lon, lat) format. This overrides
                              -l command

  -l, --location-name TEXT    Location name in string format
  -p, --pan-enhancement       Enhance image with panchromatic band
  -pre, --preview-image       Preview pre-processed low resolution RGB
                              satellite image.

  -v, --vegetation            Show Color Infrared image to highlight
                              vegetation

  --help                      Show this message and exit.

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felicette can download and process Landsat images taking the location's input as &lt;code&gt;(lon, lat)&lt;/code&gt; or the location name. They can be used in the following way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With location name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ felicette -l &quot;Kanyakumari&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ felicette -c 77.5385 8.0883
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; option uses the panchromatic band to enhance image's resolution to 15 meters, contrary to resolution of RGB bands(30 meters). To get a better image using felicette use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ felicette -p -c 77.5385 8.0883
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-pre&lt;/code&gt; option downloads a low-res image for preview, to check if the image is worth your computation, Network I/O. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ felicette -pre -p -c 77.5385 8.0883
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; option generates a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eos.com/color-infrared/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CIR&lt;/a&gt; image to highlight vegetation in 'red' color. Note that, '-p' option isn't taken into consideration while generating CIR imagery in felicette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ felicette -pre -v -l &quot;Kanyakumari&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Feli.. what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0a713a3eafaef926fc2edb0f4f297c1bf800ee75/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7134473554685a2e6a7067&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0a713a3eafaef926fc2edb0f4f297c1bf800ee75/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7134473554685a2e6a7067&quot; alt=&quot;Félicette&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q4G5ThZ.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Félicette was the first cat launched into space, on 18 October 1963. Even though she landed back on earth safely, Félicette was euthanized two months after the launch so that scientists could perform a necropsy to examine her brain. She was the only cat to have survived spaceflight. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-tpmvGRoyw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; a footage of the mission from the archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get a satellite imagery using this tool, imagine Félicette took the picture for you :))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preview and examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a fundamental asymmetry to banking. Banks don't like to share higher interest rates with their customers who have checking and savings accounts. But they are quick to pass off lower interest rates to us.&lt;p&gt;This asymmetry is good for bank shareholders, but bad for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this asymmetry, I'll start by showing how banks modified interest rates on savings and checking accounts as the Federal Reserve, the U.S.'s central bank, went through a long period of hiking interest rates from 2015 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve's first rate increase (from 0.25% to 0.5%) was in December 2015. It increased rates once more in 2016 and three times in 2017. But the interest rate on the average U.S. savings account and interest checking account didn't start to rise till spring 2018, two and a half years after the Fed's first rate hike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This irked me and I tweeted about it over a year ago:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Any day now, banks.&lt;p&gt;I understand why the rate that banks pay to savers is below the rate that the Fed pays banks (they need to cover costs). But I find it kind of shocking that banks don't match the pace of Fed rate increases. Shouldn't savings accounts by yielding ~1% by now? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ctK35xkvmc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ctK35xkvmc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
— John Paul Koning (@jp_koning) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jp_koning/status/1129335121956548608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 17, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;If you're like me, you'd assume some sort of direct linkage between: 1) the interest rate that the Federal Reserve pays its customers (i.e. banks) and 2) the rate that these same banks pay their customers, you and me. Just like we have a checking account at a bank, banks maintain checking accounts at the Federal Reserve. They earn interest on balances held in those accounts. This rate is known as the Fed's &lt;em&gt;interest rate on reserves&lt;/em&gt;, or IOR. As the Fed increases the interest rate that it pays on these checking accounts, the banks earn more from the Fed. But for some reason the banks are slow in passing these earnings on to the public.&lt;p&gt;Although the delay in pass-through irked me, I didn't take it too seriously, figuring it was due to some sort of institutional inertia. Banks are slow monolithic beasts. If they're slow to increase rates, at least they're slow to chop them, too, right? So on net, we customers aren't any worse off over the full economic cycle.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;But if banks are slow to increase rates, is it indeed the case that they are also slow to reduce rates? Well, the results are in. The Fed began to cut rates in mid-2019, just around the time of my initial tweet. There were another few cuts in the latter half of 2019. Then COVID-19 hit in March, and the Fed rapidly ratcheted the rate it pay banks down from 1.6% to 0.1%. Banks went from earning around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2018-annual-report.pdf&quot;&gt;$38 billion in interest&lt;/a&gt; on their checking accounts at the Fed (in fiscal year 2018) to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If banks are generally lethargically about passing on rate changes to their customers, it should have taken them three or four years to reduce rates on savings and checking accounts back to where they had started. Nope. In just a month or two, the banks obliterated all the interest rate gains that customers with savings account had enjoyed since 2018:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Thanks for nothing, banks.&lt;p&gt;From 2016 to 2019, U.S. banks slowly passed on Fed rate increases to their customers. Look how fast they passed on Fed rate reductions in 2020! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/jt8hHgvL7F&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/jt8hHgvL7F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;So no, banks aren't lethargic beasts that are universally slow to change interest rates enjoyed by savers. They seem to have a strategy of increasing rates slowly, and then reducing them rapidly. Assholes.&lt;p&gt;Note that the savings rate I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/rates/&quot;&gt;is from&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's website. FDIC takes the simple average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, this data probably doesn't represent the experience of the minority of financial sticklers who make an effort to locate high-interest rate savings accounts at online-only banks. &lt;strike&gt;JP Morgan's&lt;/strike&gt; Goldman Sachs's Marcus currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marcus.com/us/en/savings/high-yield-savings&quot;&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; 1.03%, much higher than the 0.10% that the Fed pays to Goldman &lt;strike&gt;JP Morgan&lt;/strike&gt;. Ally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/&quot;&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; 1.10%. But the average savings account holder doesn't bank at these institutions. They stick to Bank of America or Wells Fargo, which both offer a measly 0.01%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This asymmetry is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a new phenomenon. In &quot;Sticky Deposits&quot;, Federal Reserve economists John Driscoll &amp;amp; Ruth Judson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201380/201380pap.pdf&quot;&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; rates are &quot;downwards-flexible and upwards-sticky.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the authors used proprietary data from 1997 to 2007 to show that interest rates on bank accounts and other retail deposits adjust about twice as frequently during periods of falling Fed interest rates as they do in rising ones. They estimate that this sluggish pass-through from rising Fed rates to customer rates costs American consumers around $100 billion per year!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite chart from Driscoll &amp;amp; Judson is below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At left, we see the number of weeks it takes for banks to &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; the rate on interest checking accounts in response to a cut in the Fed's interest rate. At right we see the converse, how long it takes &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; rates in response to higher Fed rates. Decreases tend to happen quickly (the purple bars in the left chart congregate closer to zero weeks) whereas increases are slow (the purple bars in the right chart congregate close to 100 weeks).&lt;p&gt;More specifically, during Fed easing cycles, checking deposit rates are updated on average every 22 weeks, but during tightening cycles it takes an average of 50 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what explains this asymmetry? A lack of competition perhaps? If I had to guess, I'd say low financial education and dearth of customer attention. Banks can afford to be assholes because most customers either don't understand what is happening, or don't notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the banks are taking advantage of their customers' ignorance and inattention to the tune of $100 billion per year, should something be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One option would be to provide a government savings option that 'corrects' for this asymmetry. Like digital &lt;a href=&quot;http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-best-investment-in-world.html&quot;&gt;savings bonds&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe a government prepaid debit card with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jp_koning/status/1256184530542694401&quot;&gt;a built-in savings account&lt;/a&gt;. These cards would offer an interest rate that is linked to the Federal Reserve's interest rate, but only available to those below a certain income ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or what about setting statutory minimum interest rates on savings accounts? In Brazil, for instance, banks are obligated to link the rate they pay on savings accounts to the central bank's interest rate:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;In the US, interest rates on savings accounts are minuscule. This would be illegal in Brazil, where banks must set rates using a formula linked to SELIC, the central bank's policy rate: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3bupDm4L8f&quot;&gt;https://t.co/3bupDm4L8f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;SELIC is 6.5%. Savings accounts must yield 70% of that, or 4.55%. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EPkkbROQvY&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EPkkbROQvY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe it starts with education. As part of its new financial literacy drive, Ontario will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-unveils-new-elementary-math-curriculum-with-coding-budgeting-2/&quot;&gt;teach children&lt;/a&gt; how to identify Canadian coins and bills and compare their values in Grade 1, saving and spending from Grade 4, how to budget starting in Grade 5, and financial planning starting in Grade 6. If the result is a more savvy population, banks may face more pressure to pass on higher interest rates.&lt;p&gt;Or maybe nothing. In which case one hopes that over time the combination of better financial technology, branchless banking, and competition from Silicon Valley will eventually result in better pass-through and more symmetry in interest rates.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 24, 2020&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-83530&quot; src=&quot;https://psymposia-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/William-Leonard-Pickard-LSD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; srcset=&quot;https://psymposia-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/William-Leonard-Pickard-LSD.jpg 1024w, https://psymposia-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/William-Leonard-Pickard-LSD-300x169.jpg 300w, https://psymposia-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/William-Leonard-Pickard-LSD-768x432.jpg 768w, https://psymposia-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/William-Leonard-Pickard-LSD-400x225.jpg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; (July 25, 2020 / 7:08 PM): According to a source close to Pickard, Clyde Apperson’s request to be released to home confinement prior to his October 11, 2028 release date has been approved, and he is currently at a pre-release or halfway house pending full release. This is a developing story and we will provide updates and additional corroboration as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(July 25, 2020 / 12:38AM)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psymposia.com/author/nese-devenot/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neşe Devenot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psymposia.com/author/david-nickles/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Nickles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and Brian Normand contributed to this story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On July 24, 2020, a Memorandum and Order was filed in the United States District Court of Kansas, in the case of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;United States of American [sic] vs. William Leonard Pickard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This Memorandum and Order states that Pickard’s motion for compassionate release is granted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The decision comes after Pickard spent 20 years in prison for conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and dispense LSD. Pickard and his partner, Clyde Apperson, were arrested in 2000 while moving what was alleged to be their LSD laboratory across Kansas, and they were convicted in 2003. Pickard was given two life sentences and Apperson was sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment without the possibility of parole. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A petition for “Request for Modifying the Conditions or Term of Supervision with Consent of the Offender” was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas on behalf of Clyde Apperson on June 4, 2020. Apperson was arrested and convicted alongside William Leonard Pickard. The petition would allow Apperson to be released from prison to home confinement in advance of his scheduled release date of October 11, 2028. In the petition&lt;span&gt;—which Psymposia reviewed—&lt;/span&gt;it was stated that Apperson is proposing to release to the District of Oregon to reside with his sister and brother-in-law. “[Apperson’s] early release has been approved by the court and [he] is currently at a pre-release or half way house pending full release,” according to Mike Dupler, a friend of Pickard and Apperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At his sentencing DEA Special Agent in Charge William J. Renton, Jr.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/pubs/states/newsrel/sanfran112403.html&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;stated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “The proof of the significance of these prosecutions and convictions lies in the fact that LSD availability in the United States was reduced by 95% in the two years following their arrest.” At the 2008 World Psychedelic Forum, writer Jon Hanna—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/pickard_leonard/pickard_leonard_article1.pdf&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;presenting on behalf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of Pickard—questioned the DEA’s claims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While in prison, Pickard &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychedelicsalon.com/podcast-644-the-rose-of-paracelsus-chapter-1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer external&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot;&gt;wrote and published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Rose of Paracelsus: On Secrets and Sacraments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is widely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly6Zn1a-Xc0&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;regarded as a masterpiece&lt;/a&gt; of psychedelic literature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pickard’s motion for a reduction of sentence was made in light of his age (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;74&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;), his deteriorating medical condition (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;listed as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, anemia, hypothyroidism, cataracts, posterior vitreous detachment, prostatic hyperplasia, vitamin D deficiency and pre-diabetes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;), the risk he faces from the COVID-19 virus, and the positive role he has played in writing about the fentanyl epidemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The court finds that a reduction in sentence is consistent with the sentencing factors set forth in § 3553(a),” according to the Memorandum and Order, which goes on to state:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Pickard’s offenses were serious, but having spent two decades in prison he has been seriously punished. The government correctly points out that Pickard has prior drug convictions, but does not challenge the defendant’s argument (Dkt. 849, at 31-32) that the First Step Act’s change to sentences for drug crimes would substantially changed [sic] the treatment of his prior offenses. The fact that Congress has changed how such offenses are treated now is relevant to the determination whether a defendant faces disparities among similarly-situated defendants under § 3553(a).” Note: § 3553(a) is the US code for Imposition of a Sentence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Memorandum and Order acknowledges Pickard’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;assertions that—at 74 years of age—he does not pose any significant risk to society and has engaged in substantial efforts at rehabilitation, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;notes that the government plaintiff has not challenged these assertions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The court concluded that the 20 years served are sufficient for meeting the goals of incapacitation, deterrence, retribution, and rehabilitation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The decision also focuses on the Bureau of Prison’s (BOP’s) efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within its prisons:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The court concludes that Pickard is at greater risk than the average inmate of suffering a severe illness should he contract COVID-19, and further that he faces some risk of exposure to the virus.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, the optimistic portrayal of BOP efforts to limit the spread of the virus, as documented in the government’s Response, has been overtaken by events.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Nationwide, the BOP has completed 33,684 tests, with 9,936 showing a positive result. Pickard is incarcerated at FCI Tucson, Arizona, where 11 inmates and staff members have been diagnosed with the virus. No inmates or staff have died of the virus. Social distancing within the prison is difficult.” (emphasis added)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This acknowledgement of the BOP’s inability to protect inmates from the threats of pandemic in the Memorandum underscores the importance of abolition in this moment. While Pickard will soon be free, the reality is that prisoners—most of them Black, Brown, and poor people—will continue to face the horrors of incarceration, now magnified by the pandemic. With COVID-19 running rampant through America’s carceral facilities, many prisoners of the war on [some people who use certain] drugs are now potentially facing death sentences for minor offenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The § 3553(a) factors support reducing [the] defendant’s sentence to time served, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release,” the Memorandum and Order reads. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mike Dupler—a New York City-based entrepreneur and a good friend of Pickard—told Psymposia in an email that he, along with a small group of “helpers” and countless supporters around the world, have been doing what they can for Pickard’s petition for “reduction in sentence and compassionate release.” Dupler became involved in helping Pickard and his attorney because he could not bear the thought of living in a country where a non-violent drug offense could result in a life sentence due to “mandatory sentencing,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“An injustice of this magnitude had to be addressed somehow and today the Judge did so,” Dupler said. “I was informed about the judge’s decision in Leonard’s case when I read his order this afternoon around 1PM EST. To say we are happy as happy can be is to put it mildly. I exchanged emails with Leonard’s attorney and she told me that she had a good cry today—tears of happiness. She and her former law partner (now deceased) had also represented Leonard at his trial 20 years ago.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I cannot wait to see him outside of the prison environment,” Dupler said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bloom filters debunked: Dispelling 30 Years of bad math with Coq</title>
<link>https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There's this rather nifty feature of modern web browsers (such as &lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Chrome&lt;/strong&gt;) where the browser will automatically warn the user if they happen to navigate to a &quot;&lt;em&gt;malicious&lt;/em&gt;&quot; URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;medium-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gopiandcode.uk/images/malicious-site.png&quot; alt=&quot;malicious-site.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;conceptually&lt;/em&gt; simple, this feature actually requires more engineering effort than one would expect - in particular, tracking the set of known malicious URLs in a practical manner turns out to be somewhat difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because, on one hand, trying to store the database of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; known malicious URLs, which, bear in mind, may contain &lt;em&gt;millions and millions&lt;/em&gt; of entries, is something that is just practically infeasible for most users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;small-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://gopiandcode.uk/images/database_local.png&quot; alt=&quot;database_local.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, sending &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; URL that a user visits to some external service, where it could be &lt;em&gt;logged&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;data-mined&lt;/em&gt; by nefarious third parties (i.e Google), is something that most users should probably not be comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, browsers actually implement this functionality by means of a rather interesting &lt;em&gt;compromise&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a probabilistic data structure known as a &lt;strong&gt;Bloom filter&lt;/strong&gt;, Browsers maintain a approximate representation of the set of known malicious URLs locally. By querying this &lt;em&gt;space-efficient&lt;/em&gt; local set, browsers will only send up a &lt;em&gt;small proportion&lt;/em&gt; of the honest URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use a Bloom filter to act as a local proxy for queries to an external database&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proxy technique, which safe-guards the privacy of millions of users ever day, depends on &lt;strong&gt;two key properties&lt;/strong&gt; of Bloom filters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class=&quot;org-dl&quot;&gt;&lt;dt&gt;No false negatives&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This states that if a query for an URL in the Bloom filter returns negative, then the queried item can be guaranteed to not be present in the set of malicious URLs - i.e &lt;em&gt;the Bloom filter is guaranteed to return a positive result for all known malicious URLs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Low false positive rate&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This property states that for any URL that is &lt;em&gt;not in the set of malicious&lt;/em&gt; URLs, the likelihood of a Bloom filter query returning a positive result should be &lt;em&gt;fairly low&lt;/em&gt; - thus minimising the number of &lt;em&gt;unnecessary&lt;/em&gt; infractions on user privacy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism works &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; well, and the guarantees of a Bloom filter seem to be perfectly suited for this particular task, however it has one small problem, and that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; widely cited expression &lt;em&gt;for the&lt;/em&gt; false positive rate &lt;em&gt;of a bloom filter is&lt;/em&gt; wrong!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as it turns out, the behaviours of a Bloom filter have actually been the subject of 30 years of mathematical contention, requiring &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; corrections and even &lt;em&gt;corrections of these corrections&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given this history of errors, can we really have any certainty in our understanding of a Bloom filter at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;em&gt;never fear&lt;/em&gt;, I am writing this post to inform you that we have just recently used &lt;code&gt;Coq&lt;/code&gt; to produce the &lt;em&gt;very first&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;certified&lt;/strong&gt; proof of the false positive rate of a Bloom filter, finally putting an end to this saga of errors and returning certainty (pardon the pun&lt;sup/&gt;) to a mechanism that countless people rely on &lt;em&gt;every single&lt;/em&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, we'll explore the main highlights of this research, answering the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a Bloom filter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did these errors initially arise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the true behaviour of a Bloom filter? and how can we be certain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was just recently presented at CAV2020 under the title &quot;Certifying Certainty and Uncertainty in Approximate Membership Query Structures&quot;, you can find the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/certifying-certainty-and-uncertainty-in-approximate-membership-q/18186934&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a video presentation of it &lt;a href=&quot;https://invidio.us/D80VCsVeCMs?t=4482&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dance is superior to repetitive physical exercise in brain plasticity: study</title>
<link>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636</link>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal research indicates that a combination of physical activity and sensory enrichment has the largest and the only sustaining effect on adult neuroplasticity. Dancing has been suggested as a human homologue to this combined intervention as it poses demands on both physical and cognitive functions. For the present exploratory study, we designed an especially challenging dance program in which our elderly participants constantly had to learn novel and increasingly difficult choreographies. This six-month-long program was compared to conventional fitness training matched for intensity. An extensive pre/post-assessment was performed on the 38 participants (63–80 y), covering general cognition, attention, memory, postural and cardio-respiratory performance, neurotrophic factors and–most crucially–structural MRI using an exploratory analysis. For analysis of MRI data, a new method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) designed specifically for pairwise longitudinal group comparisons was employed. Both interventions increased physical fitness to the same extent. Pronounced differences were seen in the effects on brain volumes: Dancing compared to conventional fitness activity led to larger volume increases in more brain areas, including the cingulate cortex, insula, corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex. Only dancing was associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels. Regarding cognition, both groups improved in attention and spatial memory, but no significant group differences emerged. The latter finding may indicate that cognitive benefits may develop later and after structural brain changes have taken place. The present results recommend our challenging dance program as an effective measure to counteract detrimental effects of aging on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aging is associated with a reduction in brain volumes, mainly in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Regions such as the occipital cortex, on the other hand, show relatively few alterations throughout the lifespan [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref001&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. The changes affect both gray [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref003&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] and white matter [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]. The cortical volume decrease (i.e., atrophy) is not primarily caused by a loss of neurons but is due to an age-related shrinking of cells and reduced synaptic density [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]. In white matter, aging generates axonal deflections, resulting in defective neuronal transmission. Again, the most deflections are observed in the prefrontal cortex [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref006&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;] and are associated with working memory and executive dysfunction [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref007&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These age-related changes, however, are not inevitable. It has become clear over the past several years that the aging brain is capable of neuroplasticity. This raises the possibility of counteracting the detrimental effects of aging on the brain. Most studies in this regard have investigated the effects of physical fitness on the aging brain. For example, Colcombe et al. (2006) reported that six months of aerobic training, in comparison to an anaerobic stretching program, led to a significant volume increase at multiple sites of the elderly subjects’ brains [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;].

Erickson et al. (2011), for instance, demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with a greater volume of serum BDNF in seniors engaged in one year of aerobic training. From animal research, it is known that a combination of physical exercise and sensory enrichment has the strongest impact on neuroplasticity [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref026&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;]. Moreover, only this combination guarantees that newborn neurons survive in the long run [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref026&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;]. For humans, dancing has been suggested as a homologue of this combined training, as it involves sensory, motor and cognitive challenges [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref027&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. To the best of our knowledge, only three published studies have assessed the possible impact of dancing on the brain so far [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref029&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref030&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;]. However, these studies were cross-sectional observational studies that compared the brains of professional dancers to those of non-professionals. With such studies, there is an inevitable possibility that life-style factors other than those of interest contributed to the observed differences. Moreover, professional dancing is hardly comparable to what can be achieved in untrained healthy seniors. Therefore, in the current study, we designed a novel dance program that, on the one hand, was tailored to the needs of healthy seniors (e.g., safety) but, on the other hand, was designed to continuously challenge them by introducing new and increasingly difficult choreographies throughout the intervention. The effects of this dancing program were compared with an active, not passive, well-established sport fitness program, as we wanted to test whether our new intervention is truly superior to conventional ones. Hence, the control group engaged in sportive exercises that involved mainly repetitive exercises such as cycling. These activities were comparable regarding their cardiovascular demands but not their cognitive and coordinative demands. With this approach, we should be able to distinguish the specific effects of the dance training program from other factors, especially physical fitness. Consistent with this approach, on the brain level, we made use of a new symmetric VBM analysis method especially designed to compare longitudinal group differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approval for the study was obtained from the ethics committee of the Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg. All subjects signed a written informed consent and received payment for their participation. This study has been registered subsequently at DRKS (DRKS00012605), a WHO-accepted platform, in terms of omission (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.s008&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.s009&quot;&gt;S2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.s010&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; Files). The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered. Sixty-two normal volunteers, who responded to a local advertisement, were screened. Subjects with any neurological condition, metallic implants, claustrophobia, tinnitus, BMI ≤30, high blood pressure (systolic≤140 mmHg), diabetes mellitus, intensive physical engagement (more than 1 hour/week) and abnormal performance in a cognitive screening test (MMSE &amp;lt; 27)[&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref032&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;] and a test devoted to depressive symptoms (BDI-II &amp;gt; 13) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref033&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;] were excluded. Fifty-two seniors (25 males; 27 females) aged 63–80 years were then randomly assigned to the experimental dance group (DG) and the control sport group (SG) controlling for age, MMSE status and physical fitness. We had some drop-outs during the training period (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone-0196636-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1&lt;/a&gt;), including subjects who did not reach the adherence rate of 70% (6 subjects) or got seriously sick (6 subjects) or who were unsatisfied with the group assignment (2 subjects). This left us with 38 complete data sets (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.s001&quot;&gt;S1 Table&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Interventions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training conditions in both groups were almost identical regarding intensity, frequency and duration. We also controlled for psychosocial effects by providing a group-based program in both study arms. Furthermore, the SG also enjoyed musical accompaniment. Both interventions occurred twice a week, lasted 90 minutes per session and were provided for six months. To control for the conditional load in both groups, we measured the heart frequency in every single training session after warm-up twice: during the main part and after cool down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dance intervention.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A qualified dance instructor supervised every training session. The focus of this program was on continuous learning of new movement patterns and choreographies, thereby including coordination training and learning of specific dancing skills. Subjects were trained to accurately memorize and access different rhythms and step sequences in space, all under accuracy and time pressure. In brief, the dance intervention was divided into two blocks, each lasting three months. Each block comprised the teaching of choreographies of five different genres: line dance, jazz dance, rock ‘n’ roll, Latin-American dance and square dance. Coordinative demands and time pressure were increased in the second block by demanding more complex dance moves and introducing more beats per minute in the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SG trained according to scientific guidelines and recommendations of health sports [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref034&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;] and was also supervised by a qualified trainer. Unlike the dancers, SG participants performed the same exercises repeatedly. Each session included three different units: endurance training, strength-endurance training and flexibility training. Each unit lasted 20 minutes. The endurance training was performed on bicycle ergometers with the intensity adjusted to the individual training heart frequency. The strength-endurance unit implied training with equipment such as barbells, rubber bands, Redondo balls, gymnastic sticks and fitness balls. We avoided combined arm and leg movements in order to keep coordinative demands low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Structural MRI scanning protocol&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Verio scanner (Syngo MR B17). A 3-D structural MRI was acquired of each subject using a T-1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (224 sagittal slices, voxel size: 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, TR: 2500 ms, TE: 3,47 ms, TI: 1000 ms, flip angle: 7°).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Voxel-based morphometry for pairwise longitudinal group comparison.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since systematic bias in longitudinal image registration has recently become an issue, we used a relatively new VBM method implemented in SPM 12. This method has been developed especially for the analysis within longitudinal studies [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref035&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;]. It counteracts biases from asymmetric processing, where within-subject image processing often treats one time-point differently from the others. With this new approach, it is possible to directly compare the effects of one intervention vs the other (dance vs sport) on gray and white matter structures [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref036&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;MRI data processing and analysis.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before preprocessing, all structural images were checked for artifacts, and the center point was placed on the anterior commissure. T1-weighted images of baseline and post measures of each subject were taken to run a pairwise longitudinal registration. The second step included the segmentation of gray and white matter as well of CSF for all average images. To measure volumetric changes in gray and white matter, every average image of each subject was disguised with the 3-D segmented maps of gray and white matter. Subsequently, spatial normalization using DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra) [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref036&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;] was applied in the standardized MNI space. The normalized, segmented images were smoothed using an 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. For each subject, normalized and smoothed images displaying volume changes in gray and white matter were created. Since we were especially interested in group differences, we investigated only average images for each individual, as in previous studies [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref037&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;]. Group analyses using t-tests for independent samples compared volume changes in both gray and white matter between the two intervention groups. Co-variables such as age, sex and intracranial volume were entered in the analysis. For both groups, aligned t-contrasts (dance&amp;gt;sport; sport&amp;gt;dance) were calculated. As in previous longitudinal studies [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref038&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref039&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;], we applied a threshold of p&amp;lt; 0.001 (uncorrected) across the whole brain with a minimal cluster size of 50 voxel for gray and white matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess baseline differences between the dance and sport groups we analyzed gray and whiter matter volume using voxel-based morphometry. Two-sample t-tests revealed no significant group differences. Baseline values of gray (p = .340) and white matter volume (p = .497) were similar for both groups and did not differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gray matter changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the intervention, compared to the SG, DG participants showed significantly larger volumes in multiple frontal and temporal cortical areas, including the anterior und medial cingulate cortex, the left supplementary motor area, the left precentral gyrus, the left medial frontal gyrus, the left insula, the left superior temporal gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus. The red-colored regions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone-0196636-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2&lt;/a&gt; give an overview of these brain areas.

&lt;h3&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas no intervention effects were observed in BDNF serum values, the plasma values showed an increase after dance training. This is confirmed by a time x group interaction with F(1,35) = 4,3; p = 0.046; η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ,115. Although the dance group started with a lower plasma BDNF level, a t-test did not reveal a significant between-group difference at baseline (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.s004&quot;&gt;S4 Table&lt;/a&gt;). To exclude interindividual variations, we calculated intraindividual changes in BDNF levels after intervention. Again, DG participants showed significantly larger increases in plasma BDNF level than SG participants (&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone-0196636-g004&quot;&gt;Fig 4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As it is evident from the figure, the increase in BDNF level was significantly increased in the DG compared with the SG (Mann-Whitney’s U-test, p &amp;lt; 0.018).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cognitive results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a main effect of time for alertness with acoustic cues (F (1,37) = 9,48; p = .004; η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ,218) but no time x group interaction. Visuospatial memory improved after both trainings, demonstrated by a main effect of time for immediate (F(1,37) = 38,04; p &amp;lt; .001; η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ,54) as well as for delayed recall (F(1,37) = 28,37; p &amp;lt; .001; η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ,455). There was, however, no significant group x time interaction (all p-values &amp;gt; 0.6). Other cognitive functions did not change in either group (all p-values &amp;gt; 0.28).

&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study examined the effects of a specially designed dance training program requiring constant learning of new choreographies compared to a conventional sportive fitness training with mainly repetitive exercises on brain structure and function in healthy seniors. We used a new voxel-based morphometry approach specifically designed for a pairwise longitudinal group comparison. Both groups improved their fitness levels. However, as there was no group difference, the observed differences in brain plasticity cannot simply be attributed to physical fitness but must reflect the specific components of the intervention programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gray matter changes in dancers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, dancing induced more wide-spread gray matter increases than the sportive control program. The dancers showed gray matter volume increases after training in the anterior and medial cingulate cortex, in the left supplementary motor area, in the left sided precentral gyrus, in the left medial frontal gyrus, in the left superior temporal gyrus, in the left insula and in the left post-central gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex and the medial frontal gyri are mainly associated with working memory [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref049&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref050&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;]. These areas also form the basis of executive functions, cognitive control and attention regulation. In addition, the cingulate gyrus is also a part of the limbic system and is engaged in the storage of new information in long-term-memory, as well as in the retrieval of stored information [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref050&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;]. In the insula, the networks of working memory and attention overlap and potentially interact [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref051&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref052&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;]. Dancing poses demands on both attention and memory. Our dancing program was intended to keep the dancers in a constant learning process by confronting them continuously with novel motion sequences. They had to attentively follow the movements of the instructor to retain, retrieve and perform the choreographies under several conditions of pressure. Since the genre or the dancing style was changed every second week, no monotony could evolve. Rather this approach placed high demands on attentional and memory processes, especially working memory [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref053&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;]. These cognitive functions usually underlie an age-related degradation making the results especially promising with respect to a preventive potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced volumes after dance training were also seen in motor and somatosensory areas. Among these were the precentral gyri and the supplementary motor area. These areas have a preprocessing and executive function within the motor system [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref054&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref055&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;]. Again, the increased volumes of these regions can be attributed to the complexity of the dance movement patterns. The simultaneous use of different body parts for different rhythms promotes the coordination of the whole body. In addition, the changing tempi of the music induce a dynamic and temporal variability in the execution of partial (segmented) and whole-body movements. Dancing also increased the volume of the postcentral gyrus. In this area, somatosensory fibers end, which convey information from proprioceptive organs such as neuromuscular spindles, joint and sinew receptors. Other than the fitness program, our dancing program involved manifold steps and constant shifts of balance and regular turns. Hence, it can be assumed that body movement perception was trained as well as the perception of the location and position of the body and body segments to each other in space. This kind of feedback (reafference) to the cortex is needed to align and refine movement processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the superior temporal gyrus displayed an increased gray matter volume after six months of dance training. This part of the temporal lobe is associated with episodic memory and deteriorates early in Alzheimer’s disease [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]. Furthermore, it is closely linked to the adjacent superior temporal sulcus, which is crucial for auditory short-term memory [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref056&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;] and audio-visual integration [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref057&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref058&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;]. While learning to dance, participants needed to keep the verbal instructions of the teacher in mind. Another important aspect constitutes the audio-visual integration of stimuli because dancing involves multisensory stimulation with visual, sensory and auditory input. For example, dancers have to visually observe and sense their movements while they listen to music and have to set these pieces of information in accordance with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;White matter changes in dancers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White matter volume increases associated with dancing were seen in close spatial proximity to the cortical changes in frontal and parietal parts of the brains. Most outstanding was the enlargement of the corpus callosum, which carries the largest part of the commissure fibers and connects nearly all parts of the hemispheres. Hence, the corpus callosum ensures the communication between both cerebral hemispheres. Aging leads to degradation of this region, a process that has been associated with age-related loss in cognitive performance [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref059&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;]. The present findings indicate that dancing can intensify the connectivity and interaction between both cerebral hemispheres. This appears plausible given that different motor, somatosensory and cognitive areas have to communicate in order to accomplish the complex task of dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Brain changes after sport training&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to dancing, the completion of the sport program led to fewer and smaller brain volume increases. For both white and gray matter, they were seen mainly in the cerebellum and higher visual and adjacent areas. The increased volume in the cerebellum seems plausible. Compared to dancing, the movements of the sport group had a cyclic and repetitive character. After the initial phase of training, these routines hardly required any conscious control; instead, they were performed automatically [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. The cerebellum is crucial for unconscious planning and execution of movements [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref060&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;]. Furthermore, together with the basal ganglia, it constitutes the basis of procedural memory [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref061&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref062&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;]. In procedural memory, the retrieval of movement programs does not underlie conscious cognitive control and does not require focused attention. In sum, in contrast to dancing, the fitness training required less cognitive resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume change in visual areas including the right fusiform gyrus came rather unexpectedly. Initially, it is unclear why fitness training should boost areas related to visual perception, especially that of faces, more than dancing [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref063&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;]. However, as outlined above, dancing stresses audio-visual integration rather than visual perception per se. The fitness training, on the other hand, with its low cognitive demands, may have seduced participants to focus their attention on visual input–especially the faces of the other participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Possible neurophysiological basis of the observed volume changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal models have suggested that age limits the capacity for adaptive changes related to dynamic neural network modulations induced by environmental and intrinsic changes [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref064&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;]. On the other hand, it is known that new neurons are generated in the vertebrate brain throughout the life span [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref065&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;]. This neurogenesis increases with physical exercise and occurs in the hippocampus as well as in the subventricular zone around the lateral ventricles [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref066&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;]. However, a large fraction of the new neurons does not survive [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref026&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;]. It was stated that while exercise increases the rate of neurogenesis, environmental enrichment increases the ratio of new neurons that survive and get incorporated into the lattice of the existing neural network [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref067&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;]. In this respect, dancing, which can be considered a combination of exercise and sensory enrichment, may have a similar potential for inducing long-lasting survival of newly created neurons. BDNF may be a possible mediating factor of adult neuroplasticity [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]. In the present study, BDNF plasma levels increased during the dance training. BDNF is known to be important for synaptogenesis, dendritogenesis as well as neurogenesis [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref014&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref016&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref017&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref018&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;]. Activity-dependent release of BDNF during dancing, a training program that involves attention and memory process could underlie the observed volume increases of gray matter. In Alzheimer’s disease, known for its neurodegenerative process and cognitive decline, BDNF levels in the brain and also in the blood were found to be significantly reduced [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref068&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;]. Therefore, the observed increase in gray matter volume associated with the increase in circulating BDNF support the idea of BDNF-induced structural changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cognitive effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with the effects on the brain, the effects of the trainings on cognitive functions were rather low and showed no significant differences between the groups. Improvements of some attentional processes and of visual spatial memory were observed in both groups. This raises the general question of why the effects on cognition were so small compared to those induced in the brain. Two explanations will be discussed: First, the tests were not sensitive for revealing changes in cognitive processes. Second, the brain changes may precede the changes in measurable behavior, so that the latter would have required a longer intervention program. This assumption is currently under investigation in our laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other studies on training induced neuroplasticity [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref038&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref039&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;], our MRI results are based on uncorrected data because with the small sample size, the results would not have survived traditional corrections such as FDR. Next, we tested highly selected, healthy and motivated samples of elder adults; hence, whether the results generalize to the elderly population as a whole needs to be investigated in future studies. Lastly, the assessment of subcortical structures with VBM has been criticized as being less reliable [&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196636#pone.0196636.ref069&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;]. Future studies should make use of DTI white matter tractography to assess white matter changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to demonstrate in a randomized intervention trial that dancing has a strong potential to induce more positive effects on brain volumes in elderly people. Previous research has mainly focused on other, more monotonic aerobic exercises such as running, walking, cycling (endurance training) or on anaerobic strength and stretching exercises. Compared to these standard fitness programs, our specially designed six-month dancing program increased volumes in regions which relate to higher cognitive processes such as working memory and attention and which are especially affected by age-related decline. In our view, the more pronounced effects of dancing on the human brain can be explained by the fact that dancing promotes a large number of processes at the same time: spatial orientation, movement coordination, balance, endurance, interaction and communication. Furthermore, by presenting our participants with ever new choreographies, our program induced a constant learning processes. This dance training program does not need special requirements, has a low risk of accidents and can be implemented at low costs. Therefore, it endorses itself as an appropriate measure to counteract age-related declines in brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:title>Dance training is superior to repetitive physical exercise in inducing brain plasticity in the elderly</og:title>
<og:description>Animal research indicates that a combination of physical activity and sensory enrichment has the largest and the only sustaining effect on adult neuroplasticity. Dancing has been suggested as a human homologue to this combined intervention as it poses demands on both physical and cognitive functions. For the present exploratory study, we designed an especially challenging dance program in which our elderly participants constantly had to learn novel and increasingly difficult choreographies. This six-month-long program was compared to conventional fitness training matched for intensity. An extensive pre/post-assessment was performed on the 38 participants (63–80 y), covering general cognition, attention, memory, postural and cardio-respiratory performance, neurotrophic factors and–most crucially–structural MRI using an exploratory analysis. For analysis of MRI data, a new method of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) designed specifically for pairwise longitudinal group comparisons was employed. Both interventions increased physical fitness to the same extent. Pronounced differences were seen in the effects on brain volumes: Dancing compared to conventional fitness activity led to larger volume increases in more brain areas, including the cingulate cortex, insula, corpus callosum and sensorimotor cortex. Only dancing was associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels. Regarding cognition, both groups improved in attention and spatial memory, but no significant group differences emerged. The latter finding may indicate that cognitive benefits may develop later and after structural brain changes have taken place. The present results recommend our challenging dance program as an effective measure to counteract detrimental effects of aging on the brain.</og:description>

<title>Saliva based Covid test: results in 45 minutes</title>
<link>https://www.colorado.edu/today/2020/07/22/new-covid-19-test-returns-results-45-minutes-without-nasal-swab</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.colorado.edu/today/2020/07/22/new-covid-19-test-returns-results-45-minutes-without-nasal-swab</guid>

&lt;p&gt;CU Boulder researchers have developed a rapid, portable, saliva-based COVID-19 test able to return results in 45 minutes. Such a test might eventually be deployable in community settings like schools and factories, and efforts are underway to conduct further validation tests and seek regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are facing a serious testing shortage in this country right now as more people want to get tested and diagnostics labs are overwhelmed,” said Nicholas Meyerson, a postdoctoral associate in the Sawyer Lab at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/&quot;&gt;BioFrontiers Institute&lt;/a&gt; at CU Boulder. “We’ve developed a test that could get results to people much faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-caption image-caption-right&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A lab technician spits in a tube&quot; class=&quot;image-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://www.colorado.edu/today/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/article-image/rt_lamp8ga.jpg?itok=sEMhLWNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test, described in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.16.20150250v1.full.pdf+html&quot;&gt;preprint manuscript&lt;/a&gt; posted Friday on the online archive MedRxiv.org, is designed for widespread screening to help identify asymptomatic individuals. Research shows people infected with the virus but with no obvious symptoms make up as many as 70% of cases and can still spread disease. In this new test, a user spits in a tube, adds a solution to stabilize it then closes the lid and hands it off to testing staff. They process it through a simple system requiring little more than pipettes, a heating source and an enzyme mixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sample turns from pink to yellow, the test is positive. If it doesn’t, it’s negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because no swabs are required, and no fancy equipment is needed, the tests are less vulnerable to backlogs and supply chain shortages, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every test that has been approved to date requires that the sample, even if it’s saliva, be processed in a clinical diagnostic lab or at a doctor’s office, using sophisticated equipment. That can take up to nine days right now,” said Professor Sara Sawyer, a virologist in the Department of Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology who led the development of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frequent, fast testing key to curbing spread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test is based on a 20-year-old technology known as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) previously used, for instance, to screen mosquitoes for the Zika virus in remote regions of South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a sample is collected, it is heated to liberate any viral genome present in the test liquid. This sample is then added to three tubes, each containing a custom enzyme mixture which, when heated to a certain temperature, undergoes a chemical reaction when the genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 is detected. That’s the virus that causes COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment described in the paper, the researchers conducted what is known as a “contrived clinical validation.” One researcher spiked 30 out of 60 saliva samples with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in the lab. Then they shuffled the samples and gave them to another scientist to test with the RT-LAMP technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The test predicted with 100% accuracy all of the negative samples, and 29 of 30 positive samples were predicted accurately,” said Meyerson, noting that the 30th test was scored as inconclusive. Additional second-party validation tests are currently underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note that the test is slightly less sensitive than those performed in clinical labs. But a separate computer modeling study, also by researchers at the BioFrontiers Institute, found that quick turnaround for testing is even more critical to curbing the pandemic than test sensitivity is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our modeling showed that whether a test is sensitive or super-sensitive is not that important,” said BioFrontiers Director Roy Parker, co-author of that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which has not yet been peer reviewed. “What is important is frequent testing, with the test results returned as fast as possible, which identifies more infected people faster and can limit new infections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the team sees the test as a “triaging tool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
“Those who test positive could quarantine themselves as they await confirmatory testing,” said Sawyer.
&lt;p&gt;The research team, in cooperation with Venture Partners at CU Boulder, has created a spinoff company, Darwin Biosciences, to commercialize the test. The test has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration yet, but the team has submitted paperwork via the agency's Emergency Use Authorization program. The team is also working with the state to carry out further validation tests locally and, pending those results, expedite regulatory clearance for use in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are very excited and applaud the scientists at the University of Colorado,&quot; said Governor Jared Polis, during a press briefing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also working on a rapid, do-it-yourself test for infectious diseases, known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorado.edu/today/2020/04/10/scientists-developing-covid-19-test-knows-youre-sick-you-do&quot;&gt;SickStick&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on a different technology and packaged much like an at-home pregnancy test. It hopes to make it available via retail outlets someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we are all very optimistic about a coronavirus vaccine, scientists have been working on an HIV vaccine for 30 years without success,” said Sawyer. “Meantime, the HIV pandemic showed us that pervasive testing can make a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On Liberating My Smartwatch from Cloud Services</title>
<link>https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5863</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5863</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve often said that if we convince ourselves that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFrTJPfM58s&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;technology is magic, we risk becoming hostages to it&lt;/a&gt;. Just recently, I had a brush with this fate, but happily, I was saved by open source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, Garmin is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/garmin-services-and-production-go-down-after-ransomware-attack/&quot;&gt;suffering from a massive ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;. I also happen to be a user of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3hEi7YJ&quot;&gt;Garmin Instinct&lt;/a&gt; watch. I’m very happy with it, and in many ways, it’s magical how much capability is packed into such a tiny package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also happen to have a hobby of paddling the outrigger canoe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;9.2178770949721&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Paddled around the island of Hong Kong in an outrigger canoe “change race” for the 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RHKYCATIR?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#RHKYCATIR&lt;/a&gt; event! Stunning coastline and an unbeatable harbor view. Impressed at how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RHKYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@RHKYC&lt;/a&gt; pulled it off even after the typhoon devastated a lot of their equipment. 👏👏 Thanks for hosting! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ECh9nQHDVt&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ECh9nQHDVt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— bunnie (@bunniestudios) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bunniestudios/status/1059825170376941568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider the GPS watch to be an indispensable piece of safety gear, especially for the boat’s steer, because it’s hard to judge your water speed when you’re more than a few hundred meters from land. If you get stuck in a bad current, without situational awareness you could end up swept out to sea or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water currents around Singapore can be extreme. When the tides change, the South China Sea eventually finds its way to the Andaman Sea through the Singapore Strait, causing treacherous flows of current that shift over time. Thus, after every paddle, I upload my GPS data to the Garmin Connect cloud and review the route, in part to note dangerous changes in the ebb-and-flow patterns of currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s a clear and present privacy risk to upload such data to the Garmin cloud, we’re all familiar with the trade-off: there’s only 24 hours in the day to worry about things, and the service just worked so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had just wrapped up a paddle with particularly unusual currents, and my paddling partner wanted to know our speeds at a few of the tricky spots. I went to retrieve the data and…well, I found out that Garmin was under attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/garmin-outage.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garmin was being held hostage, and transitively, so was access to my paddling data: a small facet of my life had become a hostage to technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of my paddling friends recommended I try Strava. The good news is Garmin allows data files to be retrieved off of the Instinct watch, for upload to third-party services. All you have to do is plug the watch into a regular USB port, and it shows up as a mass storage device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is as I tried to create an account on Strava, all sorts of warning bells went off. The website is full of dark patterns, and when I clicked to deny Strava access to my health-related data, I was met with this tricky series dialog boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/strava4b.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click “Decline”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/strava5b.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click “Deny Permission”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/strava6b.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click “OK”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three clicks to opt out, and if I wasn’t paying attention and just kept clicking the bottom box, I would have opted-in by accident. After this, I was greeted by a creepy list of people to follow (&lt;em&gt;how do they know so much about me from just an email?&lt;/em&gt;), and then there’s a tricky dialog box that, if answered incorrectly, routes you to a spot to enter credit card information as part of your “free trial”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Garmin at least made money by selling me a $200+ piece of hardware, collecting my health data is just icing on the cake; for Strava, my health data &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the cake. It’s pretty clear to me that Strava made a pitch to its investors that they’ll make fat returns by monetizing my private data, including my health information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hard no for me. Instead of liberating myself from a hostage situation, going from Garmin to Strava would be like stepping out of the frying pan and directly into the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though this was a busy afternoon … I’m scheduled to paddle again the day after tomorrow, and it would be great to have my boat speed analytics before then. Plus, I was sufficiently miffed by the Strava experience that I couldn’t help but start searching around to see if I couldn’t cobble together my own privacy-protecting alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very pleased to discovered an open-source utility called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpsbabel.org/&quot;&gt;gpsbabel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;thank you gpsbabel! I donated!&lt;/em&gt;) that can unpack Garmin’s semi-(?)proprietary “.FIT” file format into the interoperable “.GPX” format. From there, I was able to cobble together bits and pieces of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andersle/gpxplotter&quot;&gt;XML parsing code&lt;/a&gt; and merge it with OpenStreetMaps via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html#Getting-Started&quot;&gt;Folium API&lt;/a&gt; to create custom maps of my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with getting “lost” on a detour of trying to use the Google Maps API that left an awful “for development only” watermark on all my map tiles, this only took an evening — it wasn’t the best possible use of my time all things considered, but it was mostly a matter of finding the right open-source pieces and gluing them together with Python (fwiw, Python is a great glue, but a terrible structural material. Do not build skyscrapers out of Python). The code quality is pretty crap, but Python allows that, and it gets the job done. Given those caveats, one could &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bunnie/watchmap&quot;&gt;use it as a starting point&lt;/a&gt; for something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have full control over my data, I’m able to visualize it in ways that make sense to me. For example, I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/speed-2020-07-21-16-10-44-map.html&quot;&gt;plotted my speed as a heat map map over the course&lt;/a&gt;, with circles proportional to the speed at that moment, and a hover-text that shows my instantaneous speed and heart rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/watchmap1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/watchmap1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exactly the data I need, in the format that I want; no more, and no less. Plus, the output is a single html file that I can share directly with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/speed-2020-07-21-16-10-44-map.html&quot;&gt;nothing more than a simple link&lt;/a&gt;. No analytics, no cookies. Just the data I’ve chosen to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a snippet of the code that I use to plot the map data:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, not the best quality &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bunnie/watchmap&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, but it works, and it was quick to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better yet, I’m no longer uploading my position or fitness data to the cloud — there is a certain intangible satisfaction in “going dark” for yet another surveillance leakage point in my life, without any compromise in quality or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also an interesting meta-story about how healthy and vibrant the open-source ecosystem is today. When the Garmin cloud fell, I was able to replace the most important functions of it in just an afternoon by cutting and pasting together various open source frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of open source is not to ritualistically compile our stuff from source. It’s the awareness that technology is not magic: that there is a trail of breadcrumbs any of us could follow to liberate our digital lives in case of a potential hostage situation. Should we so desire, open source empowers us to create and run our own essential tools and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edits: added details on how to take data off the watch, and noted the watch’s price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Regional Air Mobility: Why we don’t plan to operate flights under 20km</title>
<link>https://lilium.com/newsroom-detail/why-regional-air-mobility</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lilium.com/newsroom-detail/why-regional-air-mobility</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;ce_text block&quot; readability=&quot;44.06512890095&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we don’t plan to operate flights under 20km, and why that’s a good thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The idea of ‘urban air mobility’ is pretty well ingrained in most people’s minds. It’s futuristic flying cars that hop around a city, perhaps taking off from a garden, before stopping at the local shops and then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/FyinD6ZDqeg?t=11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;dropping the kids off at school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, the reality is very different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking a short hop from Lower Manhattan to Grand Central Station in New York, or from the English Garden in Munich to the main station, is not only impractical (you’d need hundreds of landing pads in one city) but it won’t actually save you any time as you’ll likely need to travel to and from the vertiport as well as check-in for your journey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_image block&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM__Journey_comparison.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt; Short journeys unlikely to save you time due to travel time to and from the vertiport&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_text block&quot; readability=&quot;62&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, we set out to do something different. Different from what most people expect from electric air mobility and different from the vast majority of our competitors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a range of up to 300km (186 miles), we’ll be able to focus on connecting entire regions with high-speed transport, rather than trying to persuade you that we’re quicker than a crosstown journey on an underground train or bike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, contrary to the idea of ‘urban air taxis’ we think there will only ever be a handful of routes in our network that are shorter than 20km (12 miles).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That might sound surprising, so I’ve picked two examples to illustrate how electric VTOL flight might be deployed most effectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switzerland: a network in the heart of Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Switzerland is blessed with excellent transport connections, a punctual train service and many beautiful places to go. And yet, even with world-class infrastructure, it still takes considerably longer than expected to reach these destinations from my home town of Zurich.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling with the all-electric Lilium Jet would allow me and others in Zurich to complete these journeys significantly faster and at a price that would be comparable to a first-class train ticket at launch, and cheaper a few years into operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_image block&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM_Lilium_Zurich_Journey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_text block&quot; readability=&quot;77.07700955593&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the opportunity doesn’t stop there. Because an air mobility service doesn’t require expensive land-based infrastructure like roads or rails connecting each point, we can rapidly create a network with hundreds, if not thousands of route options, linking up major towns and cities to create significant economic impact, better land use, and increased access to industry, culture and, of course, nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A system with only 20 landing sites would create around 200 potential routes and 10,000km of high speed connectivity (assuming 50km distance between sites). That’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;three times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;the entire French high speed TGV rail network for a fraction of the cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And since we don’t have to build tracks that can easily cost more than&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liveabout.com/rail-transit-projects-costs-2798796&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$20m+ per kilometer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we can connect smaller communities too, adapting the frequency of connection to match the demand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lilium.com/newsroom-detail/designing-a-scalable-vertiport&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By adapting existing infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;like airports, heliports, or even the roof of a parking garage, there’s a genuine opportunity to implement a network that could look like this, in less than five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM_Lilium_Zurich.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A prospective Lilium Network from Zurich&quot; width=&quot;1490&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;A prospective European Lilium Jet network, assuming a range of 300km (186 miles)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California: From the Bay to further away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The same argument applies to San Francisco and the Bay Area. While it’s known for its economic activity, its matchless creativity and for being surrounded by natural beauty, it’s also a large urban area with many centers, plagued by heavy traffic and high house prices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if we could change that, with high speed, all-electric travel? Today, traveling in and around the Bay Area is a challenge, but a Lilium service has the potential to improve journey times significantly. Assuming you start your journey somewhere around the Embarcadero, travel times could look something like this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_image block&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM_Lilium_SanFran_journey_savings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_text block&quot; readability=&quot;88.737122557726&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we imagine for a moment that you work in an office in Palo Alto, you could now choose to live in Hayward (5 min flight, $25), downtown San Francisco (10 min flight, $50), or even San Rafael (15 min flight, $70).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or maybe you want to escape to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://justfunfacts.com/interesting-facts-about-lake-tahoe/#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20largest%20alpine,305%20m%20(1%2C000%20feet).&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lake Tahoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for a long weekend? That would be less than an hour on a Lilium Jet, at a cost of around $250 at launch and less in the near future. It might not be something you’d do every weekend, but saving you three hours each way might well make it worthwhile for an occasional trip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many sites that could host a vertiport in downtown San Francisco, ranging from piers to parking lots and the rooftops of existing transport hubs. And, with a regional approach to travel, we could effectively service the entire downtown area using just one or two pads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Valley we could see vertiports providing high-speed connections to homes and corporate campuses, using shuttles buses, ride-hailing and micro-mobility for last mile travel. These could be placed alongside highways or next to the Bay, allowing us to minimize any ground impact by routing flights over the water, or above busy traffic arteries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM_Lilium_Palo-Alto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A high-throughput vertiport example in Palo Alto, with intermodal last-mile connectivity&quot; width=&quot;4080&quot; height=&quot;2106&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;An example of what a high-throughput vertiport, with intermodal last-mile connectivity, could look like in Palo Alto, CA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our vision isn’t just about one city though. We want to create a regional network that connects smaller towns and cities and takes the pressure off our highly-congested cities, helping to unlock billions of dollars of land value through more distributed growth, in turn improving the way we live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM_Network_Lilium_SanFrancisco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Lilium Network around San Francisco&quot; width=&quot;3000&quot; height=&quot;2120&quot;/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;A prospective northern Californian Lilium Jet network, assuming a range of 300km (186 miles)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A recent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.morpc.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HYPERLOOP-FEASIBILITY-STUDY.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;showed that less than 750km (466 miles) of high speed connectivity could generate economic opportunities worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The prospective network map above delivers more than 10 times that amount of connectivity, with throughput for millions of passengers each year, and yet would only cost in the order of $250 to $350 million to construct - a fraction of the tens of billions it typically costs to build a few hundred kilometers of high speed ground transportation tracks as we don’t need the land and material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping it real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bringing this vision to life means parking some of the more&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24bRtzwK4rY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;exotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;ideas about what this form of transport might look like and instead focusing on making it affordable, achievable, accessible and acceptable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have developed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lilium.com/newsroom-detail/designing-a-scalable-vertiport&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;modular and affordable approach to infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; that will enable networks to scale fast. Our detailed costings show that a 5,000 sqm vertiport (53.8k sqft), with one take off and landing space and seven parking bays, could be built at ground level for as little as $10m, and would be capable of handling 1-1.5 million passengers each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_image block&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM_Lilium_vertiports.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt; Various layouts and costings for Lilium designed vertiports&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ce_text block&quot; readability=&quot;50.127376425856&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In many cases we could rapidly upgrade the existing infrastructure at smaller, regional airports, creating a connection for even less.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And, by ruling out flights under 20km, we avoid needing to traverse our cities in every direction, meaning we can deploy the Lilium service in the least intrusive way for communities, choosing our vertiport locations carefully to minimize any impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lilium.com/files/redaktion/newsroom/blog/09_RAM%20Blog_1/RAM_Noise.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using existing transport corridors such as train tracks will minimize our noise footprint&quot; width=&quot;2663&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;An example of how existing transport corridors, such as existing rail tracks, could be used as routes for Lilium flights, helping to minimize noise footprint at ground level .

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there is still work to be done to define landing regimes and air traffic management that allow for a higher frequency of flights, you can read more about our proposed service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lilium.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;on our website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, while our approach to infrastructure is detailed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;Designing a scalable vertiport&quot; href=&quot;https://lilium.com/newsroom-detail/designing-a-scalable-vertiport&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We’ll also be sharing more information in the coming months about how our unique aircraft concept can deliver a low noise footprint, allowing it to access built-up areas without adding to local noise levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
