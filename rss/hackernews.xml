<description>&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;The Web began dying in 2014, here's how&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;30 Oct 2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the year 2014, there were many people using Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Today, there are still many people using services from those three tech giants (respectively, GOOG, FB, AMZN). Not much has changed, and quite literally the user interface and features on those sites has remained mostly untouched. However, the underlying dynamics of power on the Web have drastically changed, and those three companies are at the center of a fundamental transformation of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks like nothing changed since 2014, but GOOG and FB now have direct influence over 70%+ of internet traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet activity itself hasn’t slowed down. It maintains a steady growth, both in amount of users and amount of websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/chart-sites-and-users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/chart-sites-and-users.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amount of internet users and websites from 2011 to 2017&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed over the last 4 years is market share of traffic on the Web. It looks like nothing has changed, but GOOG and FB now have direct influence over 70%+ of internet traffic. Mobile internet traffic is now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/306528/share-of-mobile-internet-traffic-in-global-regions/&quot;&gt;majority of traffic worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and in Latin America alone, GOOG and FB services have had 60% of mobile traffic in 2015, growing to 70% by the end of 2016. The remaining 30% of traffic is shared among all other mobile apps and websites. Mobile devices are primarily used for accessing GOOG and FB networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/internet-latin-america-2016.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/internet-latin-america-2016.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share of internet traffic in Latin America from 2015 to 2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandvine.com/resources/global-internet-phenomena/2016/north-america-and-latin-america.html&quot;&gt;https://www.sandvine.com/resources/global-internet-phenomena/2016/north-america-and-latin-america.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The press, unlike before, depends on GOOG-FB to stay in business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another demonstration of GOOG and FB dominance can be seen among media websites. The most popular web properties that don’t belong to GOOG nor FB are usually from the press. For instance, in the USA there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/271412/most-visited-us-web-properties-based-on-number-of-visitors/&quot;&gt;6 media sites in the top 10 websites&lt;/a&gt;; in Brazil there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/254727/most-visited-web-properties-in-brazil/&quot;&gt;6 media sites in the top 10&lt;/a&gt;; in UK it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/272871/leading-internet-properties-in-the-uk-by-unique-visitors/&quot;&gt;5 out 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From where do media sites get their traffic? Prior to 2014, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) was a common practice among Web Developers to improve their site for Google searches, since it accounted for approximately 35% of traffic, while more than 50% of traffic came from various other places on the Web. SEO was important, while Facebook presence was nice-to-have. Over the next 3 years, traffic from Facebook grew to be approximately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-socialmedia/two-thirds-of-american-adults-get-news-from-social-media-survey-idUSKCN1BJ2A8&quot;&gt;45%&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing the status that Search traffic had. In 2017, the Media depends on both Google and Facebook for page views, since it’s the majority of their traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/referral-to-top-publishers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/referral-to-top-publishers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Referral source of traffic to top web publishers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.parse.ly/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/&quot;&gt;https://blog.parse.ly/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between media sites and the two tech giants is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15948196&quot;&gt;difficult&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, FB built Facebook Paper as an attempt to have a larger control over news consumption. Their tactic failed, but their strategy persisted through different means such as Facebook Instant Articles. The media, being dependent on social traffic and threatened by the social behemoth, reacted. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/16/15314210&quot;&gt;pulled out support for Instant Articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, GOOG notices how its Search traffic hadn’t improved, while Facebook had picked up steam, so GOOG launches their Instant Articles alternative called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and proactively starts serving articles from GOOG servers instead of directing traffic to media sites. The press reacts similarly to how they did for FB: reported bold stories about the Search behemoth’s thirst for control over news consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOOG and FB ceased competing directly, focusing on what they do best instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data shows FB has dramatically improved its dominance on the Web, while Google Search hasn’t significantly changed. How exactly did FB achieve that, and what events were key to that development? Prior to 2014, both companies had a portfolio of multiple web services. GOOG hadn’t yet become Alphabet, so it’s focus was difused. GOOG was trying to enter the social market, first with Google Wave, then Google Buzz, Orkut, and Google+. In total, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geckoboard.com/tech-acquisitions/&quot;&gt;GOOG has acquired 18 companies from the social media category&lt;/a&gt;, of which only 1 acquisition happened post-2014, while 5 of those happened in 2010 alone. FB was competing in the search market, through Bing, in partnership with MSFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2014, FB apparently reorganized itself to focus on social only. In February, it bought WhatsApp, for 11 times the price GOOG bought YouTube. In December, it canceled its Bing partnership with MSFT. User retention on Facebook.com grew steadily (see chart below). Through its four simple products, Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, FB had become the social superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-retention.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-retention.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook daily active users (DAU) divided by Facebook monthly active users (MAU)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, GOOG in 2014 started reorganizing itself to focus on artificial intelligence only. In January 2014, GOOG bought DeepMind, and in September they shutdown Orkut (one of their few social products which had momentary success in some countries) forever. The Alphabet Inc restructuring was announced in August 2015 but it likely took many months of meetings and bureoucracy. The restructuring was important to focus the web-oriented departments at GOOG towards a simple mission. GOOG sees no future in the simple Search market, and announces to be migrating “From Search to Suggest” (in Eric Schmidt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg_KxXhhsGg&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;) and being an “AI first company” (in Sundar Pichai’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Og2BnpBhkM&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;). GOOG is currently slightly behind FB in terms of how fast it is growing its dominance of the web, but due to their technical expertise, vast budget, influence and vision, in the long run its AI assets will play a massive role on the internet. They know what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are no longer the same companies as 4 years ago. GOOG is not anymore an internet company, it’s &lt;em&gt;the knowledge internet company&lt;/em&gt;. FB is not an internet company, it’s &lt;em&gt;the social internet company&lt;/em&gt;. They used to attempt to compete, and this competition kept the internet market diverse. Today, however, they seem mostly satisfied with their orthogonal dominance of parts of the Web, and we are losing diversity of choices. Which leads us to another part of the internet: e-commerce and AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMZN does not focus on making profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-profits.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-profits.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon's Long-Term Growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, its mission is to seek market leadership, crushing competitors in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-outgrown-competitors.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-outgrown-competitors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon has outgrown competitors&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could elaborate on how AMZN is &lt;em&gt;the e-commerce company&lt;/em&gt;, but I would be just repeating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWBjUsmO-Lw&quot;&gt;Scott Galloway’s exposure of this topic&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth watching his talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-web-was-and-what-it-became&quot;&gt;What the Web was and what it became&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events and data above describe how three internet companies have acquired massive influence on the Web, but why does that imply the beginning of the Web’s death? To answer that, we need to reflect on what the Web is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original vision for the Web according to its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, was a space with multilateral publishing and consumption of information. It was a peer-to-peer vision with no dependency on a single party. Tim himself claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-web-inventor-save-internet&quot;&gt;the Web is dying&lt;/a&gt;: the Web he wanted and the Web he got are no longer the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44.753170731707&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn’t GOOG defend in the open Web?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG, as a company born from the Web, has helped take it forward both technologically and in adoption. That is undeniable. They still lead efforts to improve the open Web, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/&quot;&gt;advocacy of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)&lt;/a&gt; over native mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t GOOG trying to guarantee the open Web stays alive? Not necessarily. GOOG’s goal is to gather as much rich data as possible, and build AI. Their mission is to have an AI provide timely and personalized information to us, not specifically to have websites provide information. Any GOOG concerted efforts are aligned to the AI mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile usage is on the rise – having already crossed desktop as the primary channel for internet usage – and native mobile apps are so far the best way of providing good user experience on mobile. GOOG collects little or no data from native mobile apps, to some extent on Android, but specially on iOS. PWAs happen to live in the neutral and open Web, and are better suited for data collection while providing great user experience on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/desktop-vs-mobile-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/desktop-vs-mobile-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop versus Mobile internet usage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG promotes lock-in and proprietary technologies such as Firebase and Google-dependent AMP installations as much as it advocates open PWAs. GOOG does not consistently defend the open Web. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging&quot;&gt;dropped XMPP in Gtalk&lt;/a&gt;, and Gtalk itself was deprecated, favoring Google Hangouts with a proprietary protocol. Chrome Web Store is a walled garden like App Store. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/14/tech/web/google-reader-discontinued/index.html&quot;&gt;shutdown Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; based on RSS, an open standard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2017/05/22/google-cloud-tpu-strategic-implications-for-google-nvidia-and-the-machine-learning-industry/3/#60053cf7513d&quot;&gt;Google Cloud TPU&lt;/a&gt; is proprietary hardware that only exists in their datacenters, supporting their open source framework TensorFlow. Google Inbox suffers “proprietary creep”: non-standard, closed algorithms that promise to organize your life, an essential component of a lock-in based business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG is a huge company where employees have autonomy and multiple projects and efforts are occurring. Big efforts, though, are coherent, concerted, and well aligned with its mission: to be an AI-first company, an AI that is closed and lives in their cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 90s until the 2010s, the Web we have experienced has been, albeit somewhat imperfectly, faithful to its original purpose. The Web’s diversity has granted space for multiple businesses to innovate and thrive, independent hobbyist communities to grow, and personal sites to be hosted on whatever physical servers can host them. The internet’s infrastructural diversity is directly tied to the success of diverse Web businesses and communities. The Web’s openness is vital for its security, accessibility, innovation and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2014, we started losing the benefits of the internet’s infrastructural and economical diversity. It is difficult to compete with AMZN’s and GOOG’s Cloud Services, which host a massive amount of sites for other businesses. Any website aspiring for significant traffic depends on Search and Social traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-web-will-become-under-goog-fb-amzn&quot;&gt;What the Web will become under GOOG-FB-AMZN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following analysis is an extrapolation for the future, based on the current state of the Web and strategies made public by executives at GOOG-FB-AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The War for Net Neutrality in the USA won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5431382&quot;&gt;battle in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but in 2017 we are seeing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15715030&quot;&gt;second battle&lt;/a&gt; which is more likely to be lost. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are probably soon going to dictate what traffic can or cannot arrive at people’s end devices. GOOG-FB-AMZN traffic would be the most common, due to their popularity among internet users. Because of this market demand, ISPs will likely provide cheap plans with access to GOOG-FB-AMZN, while offering more expensive plans with full internet access. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/79770i/in_portugal_with_no_net_neutrality_internet/&quot;&gt;It is already a reality in Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. This would grow even more the dominance the three tech giants already enjoy. There would be no more economical incentive for smaller businesses to have independent websites, and a gradual migration towards Facebook Pages would make more sense. Smaller e-commerce sites would be bought by AMZN or go bankrupt. Because most internet users couldn’t open all the sites, GOOG would have little incentive to be a mere bridge between people and sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG’s shift away from Search is a sign how they are growing their strategy beyond the Web. For many years, Google used to be just a tool that played the important role of assisting the Web, by indexing it. Lately, however, it is not attractive for Google to be a mere search engine of the Web. For the purposes expressed in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin&quot;&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt;, “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”, the search engine approach has been exhausted. The multi-second path from search query, to search results, to webpage, to information, is too long to provide an ideal user experience. Their goal is to cut the middlemen in that path. They have tried to cut out the results page with their “I’m feeling lucky” button, but without intelligent analysis they cannot reliably take shortcuts in that path. With AI, they believe they can shorten the path to just one step, “get information”, even without searching for it in the first place. That’s the purpose of Suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an index, people have different expectations on search result neutrality. Some want Google Search to be entirely neutral, some demand immediate action to remove some results. The European Union has both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-must-delete-search-results-rules-european-court/&quot;&gt;demanded GOOG to comply with removal requests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/google-gets-record-2-7-billion-eu-fine-for-skewing-searches&quot;&gt;fined GOOG for not being neutral in shopping queries&lt;/a&gt;. It is not beneficial for GOOG to assume the role of an impartial arbitrer of content, since it’s not supporting their business model. Quite the contrary, they are under public scrutiny from multiple governments, potentially risking their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Suggest strategy is being currently deployed through Google Now, Google Assistant, Android notifications, and Google Home. None of these mentioned technologies are part of Web, in other words, not part of “browser-land” made of websites. The internet is just the underlying transport layer for data from their cloud to end-user devices, but the Web itself is being bypassed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/google-chairman-eric-schmidt-internet-765989&quot;&gt;Schmidt’s vision for the future&lt;/a&gt; is one where internet services are ubiquitous and personalized, as opposed to an experience contained in web browsers in desktop machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while AMZN’s business still relies on traffic to their desktop web portal (accounting for 33% of sales), a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/690366/amazon-purchase-channels-usa/&quot;&gt;large portion&lt;/a&gt; (25%) of their sales happen through mobile apps, not to mention Amazon Echo. Like Google Home, Amazon Echo bypasses the Web and uses the internet just for communication between cloud and end user. In these new non-web contexts, tech giants have more authority over data traffic. They can even directly block each other, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-google/amazon-says-google-has-pulled-youtube-from-echo-show-device-in-tech-face-off-idUSKCN1C20A8&quot;&gt;GOOG recently cut support for YouTube traffic in Amazon Echo devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-appleification-of-tech-giants&quot;&gt;The Appleification of tech giants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG, MSFT, FB, and AMZN are mimicking AAPL’s strategy of building brand loyalty around high-end devices. Through a process I call “Appleification”, they are (1) setting up walled gardens, (2) becoming hardware companies, and (3) marketing the design while designing for the market. It is a threat to AAPL itself, because they are behind the other giants when it comes to big data collection and its uses. While AAPL’s early and bold introduction of an App Store shook the Web as the dominant software distribution platform, it wasn’t enough to replace it. The next wave of walled gardens might look different: less noticeable, but nonetheless disruptive to the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/goog-devices.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/goog-devices.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GOOG devices&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency at GOOG-FB-AMZN to bypass the Web which is motivated by user experience and efficient communication, not by an agenda to avoid browsers. In the knowledge internet and the commerce internet, being efficient to provide what users want is the goal. In the social internet, the goal is to provide an efficient channel for communication between people. This explains FB’s 10-year strategy with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) as the next medium for social interactions through the internet. This strategy would also bypass the Web, proving how more natural social AR would be than social real-time texting in browsers. Already today, most people on the internet communicate with other people via a mobile app, not via a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common pattern among these three internet giants is to grow beyond browsers, creating new virtual contexts where data is created and shared. The Web may die like most other technologies do: simply by becoming less attractive than newer technologies. And like most obsolete technologies, they don’t suddenly disappear, neither do they disappear completely. You can still buy a Walkman and listen to a tape with it, but the technology has nevertheless lost its collective relevance. The Web’s death will come as a gradual decay of its necessity, not as a dramatic loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-trinet&quot;&gt;The Trinet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet will survive longer than the Web will. GOOG-FB-AMZN will still depend on submarine internet cables (the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt;”), because it is a technical success. That said, many aspects of the internet will lose their relevance, and the underlying infrastructure could be optimized only for GOOG traffic, FB traffic, and AMZN traffic. It wouldn’t conceptually be anymore a “network of networks”, but just a “network of three networks”, the &lt;em&gt;Trinet&lt;/em&gt;, if you will. The concept of workplace network which gave birth to the internet infrastructure would migrate to a more abstract level: Facebook Groups, Google Hangouts, G Suite, and other competing services which can be acquired by a tech giant. Workplace networks are already today emulated in software as a service, not as traditional Local Area Networks. To improve user experience, the Trinet would be a technical evolution of the internet. These efforts are already happening today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/07/17/google-wants-rewire-internet/&quot;&gt;at GOOG&lt;/a&gt;. In the long-term, supporting routing for the old internet and the old Web would be an overhead, so it could be beneficial to cut support for the diverse internet on the protocol and hardware level. Access to the old internet could be emulated on GOOG’s cloud accessed through the Trinet, much like how &lt;a href=&quot;https://win95.ajf.me/&quot;&gt;Windows 95 can be today emulated in your browser&lt;/a&gt;. ISPs would recognize the obsolence of the internet and support the Trinet only, driven by market demand for optimal user experience from GOOG-FB-AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a future with great user experience in AR, VR, hands-free commerce and knowledge sharing could evoke an optimistic perspective for what these tech giants are building. But 25 years of the Web has gotten us used to foundational freedoms that we take for granted. We forget how useful it has been to remain anonymous and control what we share, or how easy it was to start an internet startup with its own independent servers operating with the same rights GOOG servers have. On the Trinet, if you are permanently banned from GOOG or FB, you would have no alternative. You could even be restricted from creating a new account. As private businesses, GOOG, FB, and AMZN don’t need to guarantee you access to their networks. You do not have a legal right to an account in their servers, and as societies we aren’t demanding for these rights as vehemently as we could, to counter the strategies that tech giants are putting forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web and the internet have represented freedom: efficient and unsupervised exchange of information between people of all nations. In the Trinet, we will have even more vivid exchange of information between people, but we will sacrifice freedom. Many of us will wake up to the tragedy of this tradeoff only once it is reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of popular posts, one Rust project, alacritty, received &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13338592&quot;&gt;over 1000 points on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crates.io has had over 240,000,000 downloads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;standard Rust tools are voted/promoted by the community. RLS, rustfmt, clippy, and rustup each have over 1000 stars on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.4414414414414&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a bit of history, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html&quot;&gt;a post that helped start it all&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, still a regularly referenced post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder about the en-US at the end of https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/ ? The Rust homepage is in 13 different languages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.92391304347826&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language interop is an important piece of Rust’s growth. We have C++ interop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen&quot;&gt;bindgen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.90243902439024&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also node.js interop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/RustNeon&quot;&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.90740740740741&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s good Ruby/Rust interop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tildeio/helix&quot;&gt;Helix&lt;/a&gt; and others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.5625&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python and Rust also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://bheisler.github.io/post/calling-rust-in-python/&quot;&gt;on-going interop work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to interop, Rust has been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/releases/swift-4_0.md&quot;&gt;influence on Swift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.8952380952381&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust’s focus on memory safety without performance loss has helped other languages as well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDFhvCkCLb4&amp;amp;list=PL3jwVPmk_PRxo23yyoc0Ip_cP3-rCm7eB&amp;amp;index=1&quot;&gt;including D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has also been inspired by other languages, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html&quot;&gt;revamp of errors&lt;/a&gt; inspired by Elm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.78640776699029&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has also grown from a wide range of influences, including discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Panel-Systems-Programming-Languages-in-2014-and-Beyond&quot;&gt;top language designers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust’s 1st job was on creating browser tech. In making Servo, Rust focused on both safety and speed, w/o one excluding the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.81081081081081&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust focuses on productivity also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html&quot;&gt;leaning on ergonomics&lt;/a&gt; for getting more done with fewer language rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.38709677419355&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IEEE lists Rust as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2017&quot;&gt;22nd most popular programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.4020618556701&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, according to Redmonk, Rust &lt;a href=&quot;http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/03/17/language-rankings-1-17/&quot;&gt;jumped from 47th to 26th most popular programming language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.61904761904762&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Google trends shows Rust with (albeit a little noisy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;amp;q=%2Fm%2F0dsbpg6&quot;&gt;comfortable growth over the last 5 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.75925925925926&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is global, with heavy growth in the United States and Europe. These are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jntrnr/status/924107142595878912&quot;&gt;meetup locations worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust just isn’t a lang, but a community as well, with a focus on helpfulness. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@geekytwoshoes11/once-a-rustacean-always-a-rustacean-fed0a877472f&quot;&gt;Growing this&lt;/a&gt; is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to community, Rust-focused contractors like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/asquera&quot;&gt;Integer 32&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/asquera&quot;&gt;Asquera&lt;/a&gt; have sprung up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.8256880733945&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, there are a number of trainers available for Rust. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-community/team&quot;&gt;Rust community team&lt;/a&gt; can help connect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can make it out to one of the conferences, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://rustconf.com/training.html&quot;&gt;great hands-on labs&lt;/a&gt; there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen through multiple surveys that people stick around once they get used to Rust. It’s a joy to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention, there’s also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-slack.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;unofficial Rust slack&lt;/a&gt; channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.59016393442623&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.me/rust-lang&quot;&gt;unofficial discord server&lt;/a&gt; for Rust discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.3153153153153&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is used commercially in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/2016-rust-commercial-user-survey-results/4317&quot;&gt;wide range of areas&lt;/a&gt;, incl. embedded systems, a/v transcoding, servers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust team at Mozilla is spread across three continents, with most hosting meetups/talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of meetups, if you ever have a chance to go, check out the SF Rust meetup. Lots of great talks/ideas (also free pizza!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.83695652173913&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core piece of Rust’s growth is a sense of courtesy. This comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html&quot;&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.9065420560748&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is growing into new areas. Recently, there’s been a focus on WASM support, with new tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lord.io/blog/2017/wargo/&quot;&gt;wargo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I can say that I see new faces on Rust twitter regularly. More people are getting excited and sharing their adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.65765765765766&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fun survey fact: despite more users and releases every 6 weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/09/05/Rust-2017-Survey-Results.html&quot;&gt;only ~7% of users had upgrade breakage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some may see Rust as largely Mozilla-driven, the Rust core team is actually made of folks from four different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.762962962963&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I’ve been pleasantly surprised that each Rusty Spike episode has gotten &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jntrnr/status/924337748047048704&quot;&gt;over 500 listens&lt;/a&gt;, even though it’s new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the place-holder for a lot of stuff we can’t talk about being done by companies you might know. Wish we could talk about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outreach to companies is exclusively grass roots by engineers in those companies promoting Rust and asking people to present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.80808080808081&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is growing in importance in infosec. Projects like Tor have already begun &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/tor-browser-will-feature-more-rust-code/&quot;&gt;moving code to Rust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust&quot;&gt;Awesome Rust&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a shout-out. If you ever wonder about what’s good in the Rust world, check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California Wildfires Burned Irreplaceable Documents on Silicon Valley History</title>
<link>http://www.pressdemocrat.com/business/7559762-181/hewlett-packard-archives-at-keysight-destroyed</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.pressdemocrat.com/business/7559762-181/hewlett-packard-archives-at-keysight-destroyed</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;first-paragraph&quot;&gt;When deadly flames incinerated hundreds of homes in Santa Rosa’s Fountaingrove neighborhood earlier this month, they also destroyed irreplaceable papers and correspondence held nearby and once belonging to the founders of Silicon Valley’s first technology company, Hewlett-Packard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The Tubbs fire consumed the collected archives of William Hewlett and David Packard, the tech pioneers who in 1938 formed an electronics company in a Palo Alto garage with $538 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;More than 100 boxes of the two men’s writings, correspondence, speeches and other items were contained in one of two modular buildings that burned to the ground at the Fountaingrove headquarters of Keysight Technologies. Keysight, the world’s largest electronics measurement company, traces its roots to HP and acquired the archives in 2014 when its business was split from Agilent Technologies — itself an HP spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The Hewlett and Packard collections had been appraised in 2005 at nearly $2 million and were part of a wider company archive valued at $3.3 million. However, those acquainted with the archives and the pioneering company’s impact on the technology world said the losses can’t be represented by a dollar figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;“A huge piece of American business history is gone,” said Brad Whitworth, who had been an HP international affairs manager with oversight of the archives three decades ago. He said Hewlett-Packard had been at the forefront of an industry “that has radically changed our world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;Karen Lewis, the former HP staff archivist who first assembled the collections, called it irresponsible to put them in a building without proper protection. Both Hewlett-Packard and Agilent earlier had housed the archives within special vaults inside permanent facilities, complete with foam fire retardant and other safeguards, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;“This could easily have been prevented, and it’s a huge loss,” Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;Keysight Technologies spokesman Jeff Weber acknowledged the destruction of the Hewlett and Packard collections, but he disputed the idea that the company had failed to adequately safeguard them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;“Keysight took appropriate and responsible steps to protect the company archives, but the most destructive firestorm in state history prevented efforts to protect portions of the collection,” Weber said in an email. “This is a sad, unfortunate situation — like many others in Sonoma County now. This is a time to begin healing, not assigning blame.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;He added the company “is saddened by the loss of documents that remind us of our visionary founders, rich history and lineage to the original Silicon Valley startup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The flames that entered the Keysight campus on Oct. 9 were part of several wildfires that killed at least 23 residents and destroyed 6,800 homes and other buildings in the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;Among the structures consumed were two beige, flat-roof modular buildings near the Keysight entrance on Fountaingrove Parkway. The buildings, connected by an overhang to a permanent structure, held not only the archives but also a branch office of First Tech Federal Credit Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The rest of Keysight’s campus survived with relatively minimal damage from the fire, CEO Ron Nersesian said on Oct. 10. The campus includes four permanent buildings and a recycling storage facility, together constituting nearly a million square feet of office and production space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The fire and its aftermath have kept the Fountaingrove facility closed for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMD takes on Intel with new Ryzen processors for laptops</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/26/16552208/amd-ryzen-5-2500u-7-2700u-laptop-processors-intel-core-i5-i7-chips-cores</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/26/16552208/amd-ryzen-5-2500u-7-2700u-laptop-processors-intel-core-i5-i7-chips-cores</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;0cCg6m&quot;&gt;Over the last year, one of the more interesting stories has been AMD’s resurgence to relevance as a viable alternative to Intel. AMD’s new Ryzen chips have managed to at least offer a credible challenge to Intel’s dominance in almost every facet of the desktop PC world, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/13/15963992/amd-ryzen-threadripper-processors-1950x-1920x-intel-core-i9-extreme-price-release-date&quot;&gt;high-end, multi-core processors&lt;/a&gt; like the Threadripper line to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16050826/amd-budget-ryzen-3-processors-available-price-release-date&quot;&gt;budget Ryzen 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;n67Fsg&quot;&gt;But now AMD is setting its sights even higher, toward laptops — arguably the most important segment of the computer category, and one where Intel’s lines of Core i3, i5, and i7 chips have long reigned virtually uncontested by AMD. To that end, the company is unveiling its first two laptop processors from the Ryzen line: the Ryzen 5 2500U and the Ryzen 7 2700U, designed for ultrathin laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9542169/AMD_Ryzen_processor_with_Radeon_Vega_Graphics_Die_Shot.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1509378369_8744_38778&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:9542169,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9542169/AMD_Ryzen_processor_with_Radeon_Vega_Graphics_Die_Shot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;A die for AMD’s new Ryzen laptop processors &lt;cite&gt;AMD&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4fRlFv&quot;&gt;As the company teased in May, the two Ryzen laptop chips are technically APUs, or “accelerated processing units,” which combine a CPU and an integrated GPU into a single chip. In the case of the Ryzen 5 2500U and the Ryzen 7 2700U, that’s a Ryzen CPU with a Radeon Vega GPU, and represents one of AMD’s key advantages here — unlike Intel, which has to rely on partners like Nvidia to provide high-end graphical capabilities, AMD is able to leverage its own GPU experience from the Radeon line in its integrated chips. That said, Intel does produce its own integrated graphics on its chips too, through the Iris and Intel HD Graphics lines, although AMD claims that its existing experience gives it an edge here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;L8YphE&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD is able to leverage its own GPU experience from the Radeon line in its integrated chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QPVTpd&quot;&gt;Both processors are 15W chips and offer four cores and eight threads. The Ryzen 5 2500U is clocked at a base speed of 2.0GHz (which can be boosted to 3.6GHz), with the Ryzen 7 2700U coming in at a base speed of 2.2GHz (which can be boosted to 3.8GHz). On the GPU side, the 2500U offers eight Radeon Vega compute units (CUs) and is clocked at up to 1100MHz, while the 2700U offers 10 Vega CUs clocked at up to 1300MHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gROZDi&quot;&gt;On paper, those compare pretty well to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/25/16360454/intel-8th-generation-coffee-lake-desktop-processors-faster-gaming-performance&quot;&gt;Intel’s latest eight-generation Core i5 and Core i7 U-series chips&lt;/a&gt;, which the company announced last month, although we’ll have to wait for actual benchmarking to come in to see how the processors stack up head to head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;dA9iJl&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;sklfAa&quot;&gt;For its own part, AMD claims that the new Ryzen chips will offer dramatically improved performance over its own last generation of laptop chips, with up to 200 percent more CPU performance (for multicore use) and up to 128 percent better GPU performance, although AMD’s last generation of chips weren’t exactly computational powerhouses to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;5MHrOR&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD claims that the new Ryzen chips will offer dramatically improved performance over its own last generation of laptop chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;N3TOWx&quot;&gt;Part of how AMD is accomplishing this is through things like the company’s revised Precision Boost 2 technology, which more intelligently manages how much the CPU can boost as workload increases on a more granular level. That’s instead of the original Precision Boost from the Ryzen desktop chips, which simply switched between “two-core boost” and “all-core boost” modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3EtDsS&quot;&gt;Of course, none of this actually matters unless AMD can get its chips into the hands of consumers. To that end, the company says to expect to see Ryzen versions of existing laptops from Acer, HP, and Lenovo this holiday season, with more news to come next year start at CES 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XmDcU2&quot;&gt;But if AMD can keep the momentum going — which is admittedly a big ask, given Intel’s sheer dominance of the mobile processor space — 2018 could be shaping up to be a really interesting place when it comes to laptop processors. And at the very least, its nice to see some real competition alive in the industry again.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DOJ: Billionaire pharma owner fueled the opioid epidemic with bribery scheme</title>

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-169371800-800x533.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;108 posters participating&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/doj-billionaire-pharma-owner-fueled-the-opioid-epidemic-with-bribery-scheme/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;193&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billionaire founder and majority owner of Insys Therapeutics was arrested Thursday on racketeering and fraud charges for an alleged nationwide scheme to push an extremely potent opioid drug containing fentanyl onto patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/founder-and-owner-pharmaceutical-company-insys-arrested-and-charged-racketeering&quot;&gt;According to the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, John Kapoor, 74, of Phoenix, Arizona, used bribes, kickbacks, and other fraudulent practices to get doctors to overprescribe the fentanyl drug, called Subsys. Fentanyl is a highly addictive synthetic opioid that can be up to 100 times more potent than morphine. As such, Subsys is only intended to treat severe pain in cancer patients. But according to the DOJ, many patients receiving Subsys didn’t have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOJ alleges that Kapoor, along with six former executives at Insys, paid doctors and pain clinics in various states to write “large numbers of prescriptions.” The department also alleges that Insys used &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/lawsuit-greedy-drug-maker-purposefully-flooded-black-market-with-opioids/&quot;&gt;fraudulent means&lt;/a&gt; to get health insurance providers to cover the harmful prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
Last month, a Senate investigation led by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), released &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/opioid-maker-posed-as-doctors-office-lied-to-push-deadly-opioid-on-patient/&quot;&gt;an audio recording of an Insys representative lying&lt;/a&gt; to a pharmaceutical benefit manager in order to get an inappropriate Subsys prescription covered. In that case, the patient—who did not have cancer—later died from an adverse reaction to the drug.
&lt;p&gt;In a statement Thursday, McCaskill responded to Kapoor’s arrest, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company has repeatedly gotten away with fines that amounted to a slap on the wrist for actions that helped fuel a nationwide epidemic that’s claimed hundreds of thousands of American lives. Anyone, including top executives, who potentially violated criminal law should be aggressively prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting United States Attorney William D. Weinreb, seemed to heed the call in another statement Thursday, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's arrest and charges reflect our ongoing efforts to attack the opioid crisis from all angles. We must hold the industry and its leadership accountable—just as we would the cartels or a street-level drug dealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kapoor, whose worth is valued at $1.75 billion, denies the allegations. His lawyer, defense attorney Brian Kelly, told reporters Thursday that Kapoor &quot;is not guilty of these charges, he intends to fight it vigorously.&quot; Kapoor’s bail was set at $1 million and he must wear an electronic monitoring device and surrender his passports, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-akorn-chairman-arrested-1028-story.html&quot;&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
A spokesperson for Insys told the paper that the company is under new management and has “taken necessary and appropriate steps to prevent past mistakes from happening in the future… We also continue to work with relevant authorities to resolve issues related to the misdeeds of former employees.&quot;</description>

<title>When did the golden age of The Simpsons end?</title>
<link>http://www.nathancunn.com/2017-10-26-simpsons-decline/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.nathancunn.com/2017-10-26-simpsons-decline/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’d be difficult to argue against the fact that The Simpsons isn’t quite the show it once was. Even just a quick glance at the IMDb ratings is enough to see that the show is routinely not hitting the highs it did so regularly in the earlier seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nathancunn.com/figure/source/simpsons-decline/original_ratings.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d suggest that the scale of the decline is likely even worse than it appears here due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias&quot;&gt;survivorship bias&lt;/a&gt;—presumably most of the people rating episodes in season 20 are those who enjoyed seasons 1-19—although I’m not sure how one might easily go about correcting for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline was much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/vu_qwJiAhGY?t=90&quot;&gt;Fox’s transition to a hardcore sex channel&lt;/a&gt;: so gradual that you didn’t notice it happening, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly when the heyday of The Simpsons came to an end. The general consensus seems to be somewhere around season nine or ten, with some pinpointing &lt;em&gt;The Principal and the Pauper&lt;/em&gt; (S09E02—the Armin Tamzarian episode) as the watershed moment, with even Harry Shearer (the voice of Tamzarian/Skinner) slamming it as disrespectful to the fans and Matt Groening listing the episode as a mistake and one of his least favourite episodes. Personally I disagree with this being the end of The Simpsons as we knew it, not only because that season had some great episodes, such as &lt;em&gt;The Cartridge Family&lt;/em&gt;, but also the episode gave us one of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDqYVNQIHRg&quot;&gt;favourite Simpsons scenes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if not then, then when did the golden age of The Simpsons come to an end? If we go back to look at the ratings of the show we can see they clearly arise from a bimodal distribution; that is, there is a group of episodes rated in and around 7/10 and an another group with ratings around 8/10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nathancunn.com/figure/source/simpsons-decline/original_densities.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that many of the episodes in this higher rated group were part of the earlier seasons, although some of the later episodes will be in there too. In order to separate these out we could consider performing cluster analysis on the data, essentially finding a way of grouping the episodes so that those with similar ratings are placed in groups together. A standard clustering approach would just group good episodes and bad episodes. However, I want to alter this slightly in that I only want a group to be made up of a single contiguous group of episodes; basically, if the episodes of season 4 are in the same group as the episodes of season 6, then the episodes of season 5 must also be in that group. This means we can define the golden age of The Simpsons as a single stretch of persistently high quality episodes. Other than being a sensible thing to do, this also simplifies the analysis greatly, as while there are many ways to allocate episodes to two groups, uncovering two contiguous groups simply amounts to finding the episode where the first group ends. Ideally we would like to find the episode for which there is the greatest difference between the ratings of all previous episodes and all subsequent episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to see this a bit clearer consider the effect of setting this threshold below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect of choosing the wrong episode is clear in that we’ll end up with groups which are not clearly separated. If we set it too early too many good episodes get put into the &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; category, making it better and, likewise if we set it too late then we make the golden age seem worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to choose the correct episode, we assume episode ratings in each group arise from distinct &lt;em&gt;Gaussian&lt;/em&gt; distributions—roughly meaning you would expect ratings to be pretty close to some mean value, the further away from this mean you go the less likely that rating is to occur regardless whether you go above or below the mean. Grouping the episodes then becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick an episode as the threshold between the golden age and the later seasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the ratings for all episodes up to the current threshold episode. Do the same for all subsequent episodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using these values calculate the likelihood of all the episode ratings—the probability of observing the data you have observed assuming that the data arise from a Gaussian distribution with the means and standard deviations calculated above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the above steps for a different threshold until you find the grouping which gives the greatest likelihood value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I coded this up in R (below) and checked for every possible combination (the code runs basically instantaneously so it wasn’t worth trying to be smart with this). The episode that the data best supported being the end of the golden age is episode 214, or season 10 episode 11, &lt;em&gt;Wild Barts can’t be Broken&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &lt;em&gt;The Principal and the Pauper&lt;/em&gt; (S09E02) didn’t mark the end of The Simpsons best days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nathancunn.com/figure/source/simpsons-decline/ratings.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.nathancunn.com/figure/source/simpsons-decline/densities.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a rating of 7.7 &lt;em&gt;Wild Barts can’t be Broken&lt;/em&gt; is the episode where a curfew is imposed on the children of Springfield after Homer goes on a drunken spree. The next episode, &lt;em&gt;Sunday, Cruddy Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, in which Homer goes to the Superbowl has a rating of 6.9, quite a bit below the average rating of earlier episodes, meaning counting it as a golden age episode would only serve to make the golden age worse minimising the differences between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s remarkable that the show managed to go for over nine seasons, and over 200 episodes, with an average rating of 8.2. The latter seasons, in contrast, have an average rating of 6.9, with only three episodes in the latter 400+ episodes achieving a rating higher than the average golden age episode—those episodes being &lt;em&gt;Trilogy of Error&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Holidays of Futured Passed&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Barthood&lt;/em&gt;. Given that the ratings approximately follow a Gaussian distribution, we expect (and, indeed, observe) that roughly half of the golden age episodes exceeded this mean value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although The Simpsons isn’t quite the show it once was, the decline in the show’s latter seasons is more testament to the impossibly high standards set by the earlier seasons than it is an indictment of what the show became.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be interested in how I did this analysis, either to try it yourself or to pick holes in it, the code is below. All analysis was done in R, with the plots done using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shiny&lt;/code&gt; for interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>When did the golden age of The Simpsons end?</og:title>
<og:description>It’d be difficult to argue against the fact that The Simpsons isn’t quite the show it once was. Even just a quick glance at the IMDb ratings is enough to see that the show is routinely not hitting the highs it did so regularly in the earlier seasons. I’d suggest...</og:description>
