<title>VSCodium – An Open Source Visual Studio Code Without Trackers</title>
<link>https://www.fossmint.com/vscodium-clone-of-visual-studio-code-for-linux/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fossmint.com/vscodium-clone-of-visual-studio-code-for-linux/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We have covered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fossmint.com/microsofts-visual-studio-code-editor-for-linux/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; before so you must know how much of an awesome code editor it is. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fossmint.com/microsofts-visual-studio-code-editor-for-linux/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; is open source freeware, its source code is only available on Microsoft’s official GitHub repo and its downloads are licensed under a closed source license which contains telemetry so you’ll be happy with the app we have for you today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vscodium.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VSCodium&lt;/a&gt; is a tracking-free, free and open source build of &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; created so that developers will not have to build &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt; from source which contains telemetry/trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fit is accomplished by using special scripts to clone the &lt;code&gt;vscode&lt;/code&gt; repo, build it from source, and then upload the resulting binaries to &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium’s GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; releases free of telemetry passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; is a replica of &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; and thus, works in the same way with all the features and support present in its parent project. Except for the app icon – that’s different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10222&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fossmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VSCodium-Clone-of-VSCode.png&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the feature list in &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt; is virtually inexhaustible. The same goes for &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Install VSCodium on Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; on any &lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt;-based distro like &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/strong&gt;. Take note of the pipe &lt;code&gt;&quot;|&quot;&lt;/code&gt; symbol used to join the commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add its repo’s GPG key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the repo to your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ echo 'deb https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/debs/ vscodium main' | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update your PC and install the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt install vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VSCOdium&lt;/strong&gt; is installed by default on &lt;strong&gt;ParrotOS&lt;/strong&gt; and if it’s not installed on your system you can install it with the simple code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Fedora / Centos / OpenSUSE&lt;/strong&gt;, you can install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; using following commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the GPG key of the repository and install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; as shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 
&lt;strong&gt;-------- On Fedora/CentOS/RHEL --------&lt;/strong&gt;
# dnf config-manager --add-repo https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/rpms/
# dnf install vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;-------- On OpenSUSE/SUSE --------&lt;/strong&gt;
# zypper addrepo -t YUM https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/repos/rpms/ vscodium_mirror_on_gitlab
# zypper in vscodium
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, you can transfer your tools and preferences from &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; using the instruction manual &lt;a href=&quot;https://vscodium.com/#migrate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Are you using a different OS? See how to install &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt; on your system &lt;a href=&quot;https://vscodium.com/#install&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think about &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt;? I imagine that developers who didn’t want to fork &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; because of the info that Microsoft tracks will happily jump at &lt;strong&gt;VSCodium&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Technology theft and other unfair business practices originating from China are costing the American economy more than $57 billion a year, White House officials believe, and they expect that figure to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet an investigation by NPR and the PBS television show &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; into why three successive administrations failed to stop cyberhacking from China found an unlikely obstacle for the government — the victims themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bucket&quot; readability=&quot;12.315789473684&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is part of a joint investigation with the PBS series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.pbs.org_wgbh_frontline_&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=E2nBno7hEddFhl23N5nD1Q&amp;amp;r=1VZdDzk9hRfgqzJDG4YkfOIGa0yK5RWvkExYHBGCZKo&amp;amp;m=bIYy0zwtpzzclmLzIHSxkal7LcKGa-0th__r_kT7PBw&amp;amp;s=K-n5e2jrfgffyD8mr02eBSOIxxAAby0jKdGTAyvbssQ&amp;amp;e=&quot;&gt;Frontline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which includes an upcoming documentary, &lt;em&gt;Trump's Trade War&lt;/em&gt;, scheduled to air May 7, 2019, on PBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dozens of interviews with U.S. government and business representatives, officials involved in commerce with China said hacking and theft were an open secret for almost two decades, allowed to quietly continue because U.S. companies had too much money at stake to make waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendy Cutler, who was a veteran negotiator at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, says it wasn't just that U.S. businesses were hesitant to come forward in specific cases. She says businesses didn't want the trade office to take &quot;any strong action.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are not as effective if we don't have the U.S. business community supporting us,&quot; she says. &quot;Looking back on it, in retrospect, I think we probably should have been more active and more responsive. We kind of lost the big picture of what was really happening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the dozens of companies or organizations that NPR reached out to that have been victims of theft or corporate espionage originating from China would go on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for its part, the Chinese government officially denied to NPR and &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; that it has been involved in such practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not what former U.S. Attorney David Hickton found. When he took over in the Western District of Pennsylvania in 2010, he says, he was inundated with calls from companies saying they suspected China might be inside their computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I literally received an avalanche of concern and complaints from companies and organizations who said, 'We are losing our technology — drip, drip, drip,' &quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickton opened an investigation and quickly set his sights on a special unit of the Chinese military — a secretive group known as Unit 61398. Investigators were able to watch as the unit's officers, sitting in an office building in Shanghai, broke into the computer systems of American companies at night, stopped for an hour break at China's lunchtime and then continued in the Chinese afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were really using a large rake — think of a rake [like] you rake leaves in the fall,&quot; he says. &quot;They were taking everything ... personal information, strategic plans, organizational charts. Then they just figured out later how they were going to use it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Hickton went to the companies, eager for them to become plaintiffs, he ran into a problem. None of the companies wanted any part of it. Hickton says they had too much money on the line in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we were tone-deaf to is [that] we seemed to think we could just walk in and wave the flag of the USA,&quot; Hickton says, &quot;and it just didn't work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today, five years later, Hickton still won't name most of the companies involved — and they have never come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually he was able to convince &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor&quot;&gt;five largely local companies&lt;/a&gt; and the steelworkers union to come forward, mostly, he says, because he grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school with a lot of the managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew these people,&quot; Hickton says. &quot;They trusted me. ... We couldn't ask them to be patriotic at the expense of engendering a shareholder case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he says, he could have included hundreds — or even thousands — more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've made a terrible mistake by being so secretive about our cyberwork,&quot; he says. &quot;We have not fairly told the people we represent what the threats are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government and business leaders interviewed by NPR and &lt;em&gt;Frontline&lt;/em&gt; said individual companies were making millions of dollars in China over the past decade and a half and didn't want to hurt short-term profits by coming forward. They demanded secrecy, even in the face of outright theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the impact of that secrecy is coming to light, they say. Companies are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in future losses from the theft, and U.S. officials say they are years behind trying to tackle the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Wessel, commissioner on the U.S. government's U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, says it wasn't supposed to be this way. U.S. officials had high hopes when China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/china_e.htm&quot;&gt;officially joined&lt;/a&gt; the World Trade Organization in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a honeymoon period in the first six or seven years, a desire to try [to] make things work,&quot; Wessel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he says, starting around 2006, businesses began coming to him saying that China had stolen their designs or ideas or had pressured them into partnerships and taken their technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with Hickton, Wessel says, they wouldn't come forward publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The business community wanted the administration to come in hard without anyone's fingerprints being on the reasoning behind it,&quot; he says. &quot;They wanted the profits, but they also didn't want the possible retribution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wessel says that was never going to work. While nothing in the original trade agreements specifically mentions cybertheft, the U.S. could have brought criminal cases forward, enacted sanctions or opened investigations under rules set up by the World Trade Organization — if a company would let it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court cases and documents from recent years offer a clue into what experts believe has really been going on. The Chinese government has been accused of stealing everything from vacuum cleaner designs to solar panel technology to the blueprints of Boeing's C-17 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers from China, often with ties to the government, have been accused of breaking into gas companies, steel companies and chemical companies. Not long ago, Chinese government companies were indicted for stealing the secret &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-chinese-defendants-charged-economic-espionage-and-theft-trade-secrets-connection&quot;&gt;chemical makeup of the color white&lt;/a&gt; from DuPont. China developed its J-20 fighter plane, a plane similar to Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor, shortly after a Chinese national was indicted for stealing technical data from Lockheed Martin, including the plans for the Raptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese hacking made occasional headlines, but none really grabbed Americans' attention. There was one exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Google went public in announcing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122703950&quot;&gt;it had been hacked&lt;/a&gt; by the Chinese government. Thirty-four other American companies that were also part of the hack stayed silent. Most have kept it a secret to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPR tracked down 11 of the total 35 companies. All of them either did not respond to NPR's request or declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former top Google official who was closely involved in managing the hack told NPR that Google was &quot;infuriated&quot; that no other company would come forward, leaving Google to challenge China alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[We] wanted to out all of the companies by name,&quot; said the official, who spoke on the condition their name not be used because they did not have permission from Google to speak about the incident. &quot;One of the companies we called, said 'Oh, yeah, we've been tracking this for months.' It was unbelievable. The legal department talked us out of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We felt like we stood up and did the right thing,&quot; the former official said. &quot;It felt like Helm's Deep, the battle from &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; in which you're impossibly surrounded and severely outnumbered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James McGregor, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who was there at the time, says the companies kept even business organizations like his from speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What they should have done is held a press conference and say, 'We 35 businesses have been hacked,' and you would have put it right back on China,&quot; says McGregor. &quot;Instead, they just all hid under a rock and pretended it didn't happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGregor says their silence left little room for punishment, and worse, he says, it hid the extent of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the ocean, cybersleuth Dmitri Alperovitch was sitting at his desk at a security company in Atlanta when Google called looking for backup. He says when he took a look, he was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew pretty much right away this is something very different,&quot; says Alperovitch, who is co-founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. &quot;For the first time we were facing a nation-state and intelligence service that was breaking into companies — not governments, not militaries, but private sector organizations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he says, U.S. government officials were nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They did not even publicly concur with the attributions that Google had made at the time,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama administration officials say they did not turn a blind eye to the Google hack or cybertheft from China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration was struggling with other important priorities, such as North Korea, Iran, the economy and climate change, says Evan Medeiros, Obama's top China specialist and then a staffer at the National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Direct confrontation with China does not usually result in lasting solutions,&quot; Medeiros says, noting that President Obama &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/25/443448379/u-s-china-to-unveil-plan-to-curb-greenhouse-gases&quot;&gt;secured an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Chinese President Xi Jinping to halt the attacks and put together a regional trade agreement — the Trans-Pacific Partnership — to add pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither measure lasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hindsight is always 20/20,&quot; he says. &quot;I wish that we had spent more time ... finding creative ways to punish them for creating a nonlevel playing field.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without those punishments, the attacks continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year after the Google hack, Alperovitch uncovered two more serious intrusions that, he says, involved thousands of American companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2011, he went to the White House to warn officials about what he had found. He sat down in the Situation Room with a half-dozen top administration leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most surprising thing to me was the lack of surprise,&quot; Alperovitch says. &quot;I got the distinct impression that none of this was news. When I pressed them on why they were not taking stronger action against China, their response was, 'We have a multifaceted relationship with China.' &quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alperovitch says White House officials told him that some of the same companies that were being victimized by China also wanted to continue doing business in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They didn't want to take any action that would jeopardize that billions of dollars of trade we were doing at the time,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask McGregor, the American business representative, how companies can complain about China's behavior to the U.S. government while simultaneously preventing the government from taking strong action, and his answer is blunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Companies were afraid of China,&quot; he says. &quot;American business companies' incentives are to make money.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGregor today advises dozens of American companies in China, and he says they are confronting a new reality. China is no longer an up-and-comer — it's a true competitor and quickly closing in on America's high-tech sector. McGregor says company leaders are beginning to ask whether years of theft and hacking have given China an edge that the United States will no longer be able to stay in front of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And U.S. government officials are asking whether federal agencies will be able to catch up on enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top government leaders told NPR that federal agencies are years behind where they could have been if the theft had been openly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at the Defense Department, as late as 2014, cybertheft from China was not one of the Pentagon's top priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our intelligence agencies were looking at the Middle East, at the Russians,&quot; says Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding, a China expert who worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he had never given the issue of Chinese cybertheft much thought. But then, in the fall of 2014, he loaded a confidential briefing into his computer. It was case after case in which the Chinese government had stolen the product designs from almost a dozen high-tech American companies, in a couple of cases almost putting them out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It immediately changed my conception, my view of the world,&quot; he says. &quot;I realized I did not know how the world worked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping leave an event in Beijing on November 9, 2017. The Trump administration, and the Obama administration before that, have brought concerns regarding cybertheft to the Chinese directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spalding says he made it his mission to get the word out to other government agencies. But even in 2015, he says, he was met mostly with a shrug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he went to the departments of Commerce and the Treasury, as well as the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. State Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The two responses we got were, 'Oh my gosh, this is really, really bad.' And the second one is, 'That's not my job,'&quot; Spalding says. &quot;That was almost the universal answer we got every time we went to a senior leader. Bad problem but not my problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spalding, who retired from the Air Force last year, says in the final years under Obama and now under President Trump, agencies are finally starting to take some action. The Justice Department is bringing criminal cases, the trade representative's office is investigating China's dealings and both administrations have brought concerns to the Chinese directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Spalding says, it may have come 10 years too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We all missed it,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to understand the problem and get to work on it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>The U.S. has largely failed to stop Chinese cybertheft of U.S. companies, but the companies themselves led the charge in keeping it under wraps.</og:description>

<title>Please Don&amp;#039;t Say Just Hello In Chat (2013)</title>
<link>http://www.nohello.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.nohello.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;pre&gt;
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi
2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hello.
## CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION
2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that's [answer...]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's as if you called someone on the phone and said &quot;Hi!&quot; and then put them on hold!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Please do this instead:&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Note that you get help minutes sooner, and you don't make them wait. Instead, the co-worker can start thinking about your question right away!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The same goes for &quot;Hello -- Are you there?&quot;, &quot;Hi Bob -- quick question.&quot;, &quot;Do you have a sec ?&quot;, &quot;yt?&quot; and &quot;ping&quot;. Just ask the question!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;If you feel it's brusque to simply say &quot;Hi&quot; and ask the question, you can do something like this:&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you're not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question.  I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Additionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a &quot;Hello&quot; and wondering what they missed.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Short link to this page: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nohello.com/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;http://nohello.com/&lt;/a&gt;. (If you see that as someone's status, please be prepared to be ignored if you only say &quot;Hello!&quot;.)&lt;/div&gt;

<title>B.C. introduces law to require cars, trucks sold by 2040 be zero emission</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-introduces-law-to-require-cars-trucks-sold-by-2040-be-zero-emission-1.5093110</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-introduces-law-to-require-cars-trucks-sold-by-2040-be-zero-emission-1.5093110</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All light-duty cars and trucks sold in British Columbia would have to be zero-emission by 2040 under legislation tabled Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Energy Minister Michelle Mungall says the Zero Emission Vehicles Act aims to fight climate change by phasing out gas-powered vehicles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says the legislation would set target dates of 10 per cent zero-emission sales by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030, and 100 per cent by 2040.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legislation would apply to new vehicles for sale or lease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mungall says zero-emission vehicles are part of the government's $902 million CleanBC program to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 based on 2007 pollution levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says the CleanBC plan includes incentives for zero-emission vehicle purchases up to $5,000 on a new battery electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and up to $6,000 for a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;British Columbians are eager to make the switch to zero-emission vehicles,&quot; Mungall said in the legislature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We have the highest per capita adoption of zero-emission vehicles in Canada, with over 17,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road, averaging four per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2018.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The provincial government says the program will roll out starting with the 2020 model year but doesn't yet have emission targets for that year, as it's still consulting with the industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk's SpaceX Falcon Heavy launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida carrying a satellite into orbit for Saudi Arabian company Arabsat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as having its first commercial payload, it was also the first time the three lower boosters of the rocket returned to Earth successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rocket is part of a growing number of launch services at SpaceX, which includes the Crew Dragon that docked onto the International Space Station in March.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Slack Is Not Where &amp;#039;Deep Work&amp;#039; Happens</title>
<link>https://blog.nuclino.com/slack-is-not-where-deep-work-happens</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.nuclino.com/slack-is-not-where-deep-work-happens</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/files/a266f929-f845-4f55-ad65-63c9f7d41978/deep-work.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;deep-work&quot; data-displaymode=&quot;medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did you start your day today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably reached for the phone. Turned off the alarm. Glanced at the time. Scrolled through the Slack notifications. Went through the emails. You will likely continue doing it throughout the day, approximately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/dscout-research-people-touch-cell-phones-2617-times-a-day-2016-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;2,617 more times&lt;/a&gt;, according to some studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all do it, and despite all the virtues of digital minimalism, completely giving up those habits is extreme and, arguably, unnecessary. Yet we live in a culture obsessed with productivity and these harmless distractions are wreaking havoc on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now officially have &lt;strong&gt;a shorter attention span than a goldfish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by Microsoft found that since the year 2000 – or about when the mobile revolution began – the average human attention span dropped from 12 to 8 seconds, which places us just below a goldfish, which tends to stay focused for an entire 9 seconds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humbling – but not that surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your brain is hooked on distraction, it’s constantly seeking the next hit of cheap stimulation from email or chat, playing an endless game of whack-a-mole with unread notifications. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/open-plan-office-great-for-photo-shoots-terrible-for-collaboration&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;proliferation of open-plan offices&lt;/a&gt; is not helping matters either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have reached a point where we have to relearn how to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/files/0b55a181-d9af-4f52-b5ef-ed8c04f5203d/dilbert-deep-work.gif&quot; alt=&quot;dilbert-deep-work&quot; data-displaymode=&quot;medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we manage to get any work done at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many tasks we perform don’t require full concentration – answering emails, attending meetings, chatting on Slack – they fall under what Cal Newport calls &lt;strong&gt;shallow work&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his bestselling workplace productivity book &lt;a href=&quot;http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;, Newport argues that &lt;strong&gt;deep work&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, – the kind of work that draws upon all your mental reserves and requires singular focus – is both increasingly important and increasingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shallow Work&lt;/strong&gt;: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Work&lt;/strong&gt;: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cal Newport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steady flow of distractions is irreparably fracturing our attention and limiting our capacity to go deep. Instead of focusing on solving a single challenging and high-impact problem, we tend to go back and forth between surface-level work and substitute busyness for real productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It creates the impression of being continually – and visibly – engaged in an activity, which leads us to the false conclusion that &lt;strong&gt;as long as we keep ourselves busy, we’re being productive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being distracted then becomes our equilibrium state that we seek and welcome. It’s better to act busy than appear unproductive while trying to perform deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Of makers and managers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/files/82ffa49d-4fc8-4906-b92c-525f6d60dae9/coleridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;coleridge&quot; data-displaymode=&quot;medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one morning in 1797, the English poet &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge&quot; title=&quot;Samuel Taylor Coleridge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge&lt;/a&gt; was composing his famous poem &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan&quot; title=&quot;Kubla Khan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Kubla Khan&lt;/a&gt;, which came to him in an opium-induced dream the night before. Upon waking, he set about writing until he was interrupted by an unknown &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_from_Porlock&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;person from Porlock&lt;/a&gt;. The interruption caused him to forget the rest of the lines, and Kubla Khan, only 54 lines long, was never completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the validity of this anecdote has been questioned, it does, nonetheless, illustrate how a &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;maker's schedule&lt;/a&gt; differs from that of a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the manager's schedule, each day is cut into 30-minute or one-hour intervals. The maker’s day is different. He needs time to create, to build – but, before that, he needs to think. A productive day for the maker is made up of deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And when you're operating on the maker's schedule, distractions are a disaster.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/files/1101b4f8-0967-42da-9bbb-f8c142fbee42/programmer-distractions-deep-work.png&quot; alt=&quot;programmer-distractions-deep-work&quot; data-displaymode=&quot;medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slack is where (shallow) work happens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.3623188405797&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Group chat is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/author/jason-fried/&quot; title=&quot;Posts by Jason Fried&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Jason Fried&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO at Basecamp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a maker, a single 30-minute-long meeting can blow the whole afternoon. As people began to wake up to the productive disadvantages of meetings, a trendier alternative in the form of instant messaging tools like Slack has taken their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is arguably even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least meetings consume a bounded amount of time. Chat, on the other hand, maintains a constant presence throughout your workday. The brightly colored pop-up notifications accompanied by a pleasant little sound effect elicits an almost Pavlovian response, leaving us in a constant state of partial focus and robbing us of uninterrupted stretches of time to concentrate on the work we’re supposed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you don't even feel annoyed – on the contrary, Slack makes distractions fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the problem with today’s collaboration tools – they are &lt;strong&gt;amplifying the problematic aspects of our nature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are impatient and addicted to push notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a fear of missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We care about our team’s perceptions and don’t want to look like we’re slacking off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Slack at fault here? It’s common in the software industry to blame the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You're using it wrong.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, most of us can’t be trusted with tools that are packed with so many traps for our distraction-addicted brains. Every tool is a combination of design decisions and in the end, most people simply follow the patterns suggested by the design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is it possible to find a balance between connectedness and focused productivity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newport defines four main strategies to produce deep, meaningful work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/files/42ce9a08-3ebc-4706-b845-3fb43da4110c/deep-work-shallow-work.png&quot; alt=&quot;deep-work-shallow-work&quot; data-displaymode=&quot;medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monastic&lt;/strong&gt;: Become a hermit and live a life of prolonged and near-total seclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bimodal&lt;/strong&gt;: Divide your time between extreme isolation and shallow work stretches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhythmic&lt;/strong&gt;: Make daily deep work sessions a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalistic&lt;/strong&gt;: Fit deep work into your schedule whenever there's a gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with all of these solutions is that they help with individual productivity – say, if you are writing a book, you could try the monastic approach, ditching the city for a gig as a caretaker at an isolated hotel to fully immerse yourself into deep work and get your creative juices flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not as practical in a team setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless everyone’s deep work schedule is synchronized, the team as a whole is left with no time for real-time collaboration. It may work with very small teams that are extremely cohesive, but it becomes increasingly infeasible as the team gets larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuclino.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nuclino&lt;/a&gt; is not immune to digital distractions, and – especially since we are building a real-time team collaboration tool ourselves – finding a solution has been an ongoing challenge. Over the years, we have experimented with different ways of managing our time and attention and have identified a few deep work policies that have worked well for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Asynchronous communication by default&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have come to the conclusion that Basecamp's “&lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time&lt;/a&gt;” rule of thumb is the best way to maximize our overall team productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our team's work (including the writing of this article) happens in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuclino.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Nuclino&lt;/a&gt;, and even though it's a real-time collaboration tool, most of it happens &lt;strong&gt;asynchronously&lt;/strong&gt;. Without the expectations of an immediate response, our team is free to focus on our work, reconnecting later to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/files/357a605d-4494-4c10-b2bb-545532fa0b70/nuclino-asynchronous-content-collaboration.png&quot; alt=&quot;nuclino-asynchronous-content-collaboration&quot; data-displaymode=&quot;medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed that constant communication is most effective, but our experience and multiple &lt;a href=&quot;https://behavioralscientist.org/bursty-communication-can-help-remote-teams-thrive/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; that bursts of rapid communication, followed by longer periods of silence, lead to better results. We still have a Slack account, and it's reserved for emergencies, not-work-related discussions, and lunch plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Prioritizing, committing, and completing tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that make focusing so difficult is that the impact of work is often so hard to define and measure. When everything seems important and urgent, it’s difficult to prioritize, and responding to 20 emails starts to feel more productive than thinking about strategies to move that project forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it's better to identify the one thing that we believe will have the biggest impact and commit to it, not allowing ourselves to get sidetracked by shallower work till it's complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.nuclino.com/files/095f97c3-d878-4092-864d-a56ca0cade97/nuclino-ron-swanson.gif&quot; alt=&quot;nuclino-ron-swanson&quot; data-displaymode=&quot;medium&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Long uninterrupted stretches to get work done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do deep work, we require the time and space to get into the zone. Short chunks of time – 10 minutes here, 30 minutes there – aren’t going to do it. People need hours of uninterrupted, private time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes the office may not be the best place for it. Even though our team is small enough to be able to work productively in one room without distracting each other, we make it a habit to work remotely part of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Meetings as a last resort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having survived many meetings that should have been an email (or, in our case, a Nuclino item), we have committed to using meetings as a last resort. And the few meetings we have, we try to make count – to avoid thinking on the spot and then allowing the discussion to go in circles, we make it a habit to write up our thoughts first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people have time to clearly and concisely lay out their ideas, read and absorb the content, and incubate their responses there is no need to waste time getting everyone on the same page and you can proceed to an informed discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, you may realize that the meeting is no longer needed at all – and whether you're a maker or a manager, you are likely to always have better things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Great developers are raised, not hired</title>
<link>https://sizovs.net/2019/04/10/the-best-developers-are-raised-not-hired/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sizovs.net/2019/04/10/the-best-developers-are-raised-not-hired/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every company on the market is &lt;strong&gt;looking for the best talent&lt;/strong&gt;. Companies are waiting when “the talent” will appear from nowhere as if there were some secret talent factory. The ideal candidate will have all necessary technical skills, will be a good “culture fit” and will perform well with little or no supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best developers I hired were far from ideal candidates. They lacked technical skills, didn’t know how to test software and work in an agile team. They didn’t believe in themselves and their ability. They didn’t think they can be good leaders. They didn’t sound convincing during the job interview. &lt;strong&gt;Some of them were suffering from impostor syndrome, doubting their actual ability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/impostor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Impostor Sydrome&quot;/&gt; Image from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, companies create ridiculously complicated multi-step interview processes that &lt;a href=&quot;https://rejected.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;filter out&lt;/a&gt; candidates that are “not good enough.” We rarely give an opportunity to candidates spoiled by shitty companies and bad influence. We forget that some candidates weren’t lucky enough to meet an inspiring mentor or work in a supportive team. Broken toys are not welcome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/broken_toy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A broken toy&quot;/&gt; A broken toy
&lt;p&gt;We prefer hiring self-confident rockstars with a solid track record. The reason is simple – we fail to create environment and work conditions in which people can grow professionally, develop good habits and become rock-stars. Skilled developers do not have time for mentoring, because they are busy with coding and architecture. Mentoring is not part of our hiring and delivery processes. Mentoring is not a buzzword, you can’t learn it on Coursera, and it’s not visible on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tech radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies spend millions on TA departments, recruiters, promo websites and videos, struggling to find the best talent. We have this crazy talent search problem because companies are searching for the best engineers, instead of raising them. Everyone is fishing, but there is not much fish left. Recruiting more fishers and paying them high commission does not help. &lt;strong&gt;The pond is empty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/fishing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fishing&quot;/&gt; Nowaday's recruiting
&lt;p&gt;In the current market situation, every company needs to build a mentoring capacity. The most experienced developers should find time to grow less experienced colleagues through pair programming, continuous feedback, career advice. We must suggest &lt;a href=&quot;https://sizovs.net/2019/03/17/the-best-books-all-software-developers-must-read/&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, blogs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.tube&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;, encourage colleagues to attend meetups, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sizovs.net/2019/03/21/the-best-developer-conferences/&quot;&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;, and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentoring is not easy; it requires a significant time commitment and excellent communication skills. We must encourage developers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://principal.dev&quot;&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; mentoring skills. If you are in doubt whether you should invest time in mentoring, I can assure you that mentoring is the best way to get followers and boost your authority and reputation. &lt;strong&gt;Your mentees will support you and promote you for the rest of your life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/funclub.jpg&quot;/&gt; Your mentees is your fan club.
&lt;p&gt;By building mentoring capacity at work, you can hire newcomers, broken toys, impostors and turn them into the loyal, high-quality workforce. Shifting focus from assessing to mentoring can simplify your interviewing process. Instead of trying to predict future performance by asking tough questions and sending candidate through nine circles of hell, you can hire candidates with a growth mindset and grow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you send this stone to a trash can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/raw_diamond.jpg&quot;/&gt; A stone. Doesn't look like a diamond.
&lt;p&gt;The same stone after careful cutting and polishing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://sizovs.net/images/diamond.gif&quot;/&gt; Now it's a beautiful diamond.
&lt;p&gt;Someone has to take a raw diamond that looks like a regular stone, cut it, polish it and voila – you have a beautiful shiny diamond. Companies are looking for polished diamonds and create hiring processes that throw raw diamonds in a trash bin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of throwing diamonds away, we can learn to polish them. &lt;strong&gt;We can create environments where people with eagerness and capacity to learn can become great developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5.4385474860335&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2.910780669145&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some money, energy, time that you spend on recruiting and invest it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://principal.dev&quot;&gt;teaching&lt;/a&gt; your best developers mentoring skills. Give your best developers time for mentoring and free them up from routine tasks. They will build a workforce that will exceed your expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjust your interview process and give a chance to candidates that are not good enough yet, but are eager to learn and have a growth mindset. They are raw diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relax “hard requirements” in your job ads to avoid filtering out impostors. Remember that most women apply to positions only where they 100% fit the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in a large company and care about our profession, consider creating a Bootcamp for complete beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can escape this crazy hiring race by creating an environment, where experienced developers mentor less experienced developers. Hire for attitude, and teach technical skills. Great developers are raised, not hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be the company that says: we are &lt;del&gt;hiring&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;mentoring&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
