<title>Show HN: A new spline</title>
<link>https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2018/12/21/new-spline.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://raphlinus.github.io/curves/2018/12/21/new-spline.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been heads-down for the last month or so working on a new spline, and now I’m excited to show it to the world. It is a continuation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://levien.com/spiro&quot;&gt;Spiro&lt;/a&gt; work I did for my PhD thesis, and solves most of the problems that held that back from wider popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the impatient, click on the screenshot below to try the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spline.technology/demo&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spline.technology/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/spline_screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;spline screenshot&quot; width=&quot;359&quot; height=&quot;405&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stability-and-robustness&quot;&gt;Stability and robustness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems with Spiro was that the underlying constraint system didn’t always have a unique solution. The solver would often fail to converge, making wild patterns reminiscent of particle accelerator tracks. That didn’t give the impression of a reliable tool; it felt like a rough research prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new spline solves this problem, smoothly going through cusps in the cases where Spiro would suddenly reverse the direction of loops. I was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/kcurves.pdf&quot;&gt;κ-Curves&lt;/a&gt;, the technology underlying the new “curvature tool” in Adobe Illustrator, which also uses cusps to achieve robustness (and, kindly enough, cites my work as an example of the problem it solves). The exact approach I used was more similar to [Hobby’s splines], originally designed for Metafont, and also uses cubic segments that somewhat approximate Euler spirals as the basic curve family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-supple-curves&quot;&gt;More supple curves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiro basically optimized for the smallest possible curvature variance. This tendency to small curvature variation is similar to a stiff piece of spring steel, though the analogy isn’t perfect (for those wanting to understand what’s really going on, the details are in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://levien.com/phd/phd.html&quot;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s nice that you can make smooth curves, these stiff-spring curves are not the only ones artists and font designers draw. Sometimes you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; more dramatic variations in curvature. The new spline follows the artist’s intent a lot more faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;explicit-tangents-and-curvature-blending&quot;&gt;Explicit tangents and curvature blending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extremely important feature for font design is smooth transitions from smooth to curved sections; if you just weld a curved section to a straight line, the transition is visible. Spiro was good at this, but had a very confusing UX, involving “one-way constraints.” It was easy to get those backwards, and then your curve would be all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new spline solves this problem, but with a completely different approach to UX. Now you can set an explicit tangent on points, and when that lines up with a straight section, the curvature ramps up smoothly from zero at that point. You can see this on the right hand side of the “a” outline in the screenshot above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, when explicit tangents would cause curvature discontinuity, the new spline just adjusts curvature along the curve so that it matches at the control point (the curvature at that point is “blend” of the raw curvatures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect is more flexibility over the resulting shapes, intuitive control, and always smooth results (in the form of G2 continuity - if the artist wants to draw a lumpy line, there’s nothing preventing that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-research-prototype&quot;&gt;A research prototype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online demo is a research prototype, sparse in features and still with some rough edges. For example, I’m still fine-tuning the exact curve family, and believe I can get blending even smoother than it is now. But it’s good enough I wanted to share it with the world. The numerical methods aren’t perfect, and if you push it hard it’ll sometimes get a slightly wrong answer. It still can’t do multiple subpaths, so it can’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; be used to draw font shapes (hence the lack of an inner subpath in the screenshot above), but I think it’s possible to start to get a feel with what I have now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raphlinus/spline-research&quot;&gt;research repo&lt;/a&gt;, and is in JavaScript with a GPL license. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the production code yet, which I intend to port to at least C++ so that it can be more easily integrated into existing font and vector curve editor codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repo contains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://spline.technology/paper1.pdf&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; of the spline itself, but I haven’t yet written up a good account of the curvature blending. That’s mostly because I just today got it working well enough that I felt confident sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in licensing this spline. Ideally I’d be working with a partner who would be able to deliver a great user experience. I realize the rough research prototype needs refinement before it can be used in production, but I’m eager to do that, ideally customizing it for the specific needs. I think there’s potential in font design (my original motivation), vector artwork, info visualization, CAD, map rendering, and other areas. There are some discussions underway, and I’m open to more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want people to play with this prototype, if for no other purpose than to advance the state of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;acknowledgments&quot;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Jacob Rus and Carlo Séquin for stimulating discussions during the development of this spline; they’ve both helped refine the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18738275&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobste.rs/s/t51wqm/new_spline&quot;&gt;Lobsters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An Apology and an Update</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://slackhq.com/an-apology-and-an-update</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two days ago, we updated our system for applying location information to comply with U.S. trade embargoes and economic sanctions regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soon after updating, we discovered that we made a series of mistakes and inadvertently deactivated a number of accounts that we shouldn’t have. We recognize the disruption and inconvenience this caused and we sincerely apologize to the people affected by our actions. In fact, we also apologize to the people whose accounts we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;intended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;to disable in order to comply with these regulations. We did not handle the communication well and in both cases we failed to live up to our own standards for courtesy and customer-centricity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We did not block any user based on their nationality or ethnicity. As is standard in the enterprise software industry, Slack uses location information principally derived from IP addresses to implement these required blocks. We do not collect, use, or possess any information about the nationality or ethnicity of our users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have restored access to most of the mistakenly blocked accounts, and we are working hard to restore any remaining users whose access was blocked in error. If you think we’ve made a mistake in blocking your access, please reach out to feedback@slack.com and we’ll review as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We would also like to notify our users that as we continue to update our systems over the next several weeks, we will soon begin blocking access to our service from IP addresses associated with an embargoed country. Users who travel to a sanctioned country may not be able to access Slack while they remain in that country. However, we will not deactivate their account and they will be able to access Slack when they return to countries or regions for which no blocking is required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We acknowledge that we made several mistakes here. Our attempts to comply with these regulations were not well-implemented. In our communications, we did not treat our customers and other users with the respect they deserve. And finally, in the rush to understand the impact and begin the process of mitigation, we were slow to communicate what was happening. To everyone affected, we apologize. We’ll take the failures here as lessons we can use to improve our service and avoid similar mistakes in the future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Discord raises $150M, surpassing $2B valuation</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Chatty gamers are apparently worth billions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discordapp.com/&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, the gaming chat startup with more than 200 million active users, announced Friday that it had secured $150 million in funding at a $2.05 billion valuation. The round was led by Greenoaks Capital with participation from Firstmark, Tencent, IVP, Index Ventures and Technology Opportunity Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company announced this past April that they had raised $50 million in funding at a $1.65 billion valuation. With this latest bout of cash, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/discord&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;discord&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; has now pulled in more than $280 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influx of new money comes as the chat startup goes full speed ahead on one of its most ambitious offshoots to date, taking on games giant Valve with a gaming store meant to rival the ubiquitous Steam store. The company launched a global beta of the Discord Store in October; they recently announced that starting in 2019, they will be establishing a revenue split of 90/10 for developers that are self-publishing titles on the store, a margin much friendlier to indie devs than the 70/30 split on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s bread-and-butter remains its chat service, which brings voice and text communications to gamers looking to talk with teammates and fellow enthusiasts during and outside of gameplay. Discord isn’t the only service that offers this capability, but it is definitely one of the most popular with hundreds of millions of users coming to the app every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chatted with CEO Jason Citron at our most recent Disrupt SF event, where he talked about the opportunities available in the online games sales market and what challenges the company had up ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can you use a magnifying glass and moonlight to light a fire? (2016)</title>
<link>https://what-if.xkcd.com/145/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://what-if.xkcd.com/145/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;question&quot;&gt;Can you use a magnifying glass and moonlight to light a fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;—Rogier Spoor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this sounds like a pretty easy question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magnifying glass concentrates light on a small spot. As many mischevious kids can tell you, a magnifying glass as small as a square inch in size can collect enough light to start a fire. A little &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/27/bafact-math-the-sun-is-400000-times-brighter-than-the-full-moon/&quot;&gt;Googling&lt;/a&gt; will tell you that the Sun is 400,000 times brighter than the Moon, so all we need is a 400,000-square-inch magnifying glass. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;BZZZZZZZT&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/wrong.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Here's the real answer: &lt;strong&gt;You can't start a fire with moonlight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Pretty sure this is a Bon Jovi song.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; no matter &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; big your magnifying glass is. The reason is kind of subtle. It involves a lot of arguments that sound wrong but aren't, and generally takes you down a rabbit hole of optics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;A rabbit hole of optics&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/rabbit.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, here's a general rule of thumb: &lt;strong&gt;You can't use lenses and mirrors to make something hotter than the surface of the light source itself.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, you can't use sunlight to make something hotter than the surface of the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to show why this is true using optics, but a simpler—if perhaps less satisfying—argument comes from thermodynamics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenses and mirrors work for free; they don't take any energy to operate.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;And, more specifically, everything they do is fully reversible—which means you can add them in without increasing the entropy of the system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you could use lenses and mirrors to make heat flow from the Sun to a spot on the ground that's hotter than the Sun, you'd be making heat flow from a colder place to a hotter place without expending energy. The second law of thermodynamics says you can't do that. If you could, you could make a perpetual motion machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;The First Law of Thermodynamics states that a robot must not harm a human being, unless not doing so would lead to an increase in entropy.&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/wait.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun is about 5,000°C, so our rule says you can't focus sunlight with lenses and mirrors to get something any hotter than 5,000°C. The Moon's sunlit surface is a little over 100°C, so you can't focus moonlight to make something hotter than about 100°C. That's too cold to set most things on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But wait,&quot; you might say. &quot;The Moon's light isn't like the Sun's! The Sun is a blackbody—its light output is related to its high temperature. The Moon shines with reflected sunlight, which has a &quot;temperature&quot; of thousands of degrees—that argument doesn't work!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work, for reasons we'll get to later. But first, hang on—is that rule even correct for the Sun? Sure, the thermodynamics argument seems hard to argue with,&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Because it's correct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but to someone with a physics background who's used to thinking of energy flow, it may seem hard to swallow. Why &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; you concentrate lots of sunlight onto a point to make it hot? Lenses can concentrate light down to a tiny point, right? Why can't you just concentrate more and more of the Sun's energy down onto the same point? With over 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; watts available, you should be able to get a point as hot as you want, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except lenses &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; concentrate light down onto a point—not unless the light source is also a point. They concentrate light down onto an &lt;em&gt;area&lt;/em&gt;—a tiny image of the Sun.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=sunspotter+solar+telescope&quot;&gt;big one&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This difference turns out to be important. To see why, let's look at an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;(Not actual size)&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/atoc.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lens directs all the light from point A to point C. If the lens were to concentrate light from the Sun down to a point, it would need to direct all the light from point B to point C, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;(This drawing of the Sun is actual size, but very far away from you; you're seeing it through a hole in your screen.)&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/atoc2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now we have a problem. What happens if light goes back from point C toward the lens? Optical systems are reversible, so the light should be able to go back to where it came from—but how does the lens know whether the light came from B or to A?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, there's no way to &quot;overlay&quot; light beams on each other, because the whole system has to be reversible. This keeps you from squeezing more light in from a given direction, which puts a limit on how much light you can direct from a source to a target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can't overlay light rays, but can't you, you know, sort of smoosh them closer together, so you can fit more of them side-by-side? Then you could gather lots of smooshed beams and aim them at a target from slightly different angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;MYSTERY SMOOSHER&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/smoosh.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nope, you can't do this.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;We already know this, of course, since earlier we said that it would let you violate the second law of thermodynamics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that any optical system follows a law called &lt;em&gt;conservation of étendue&lt;/em&gt;. This law says that if you have light coming into a system from a bunch of different angles &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; over a large &quot;input&quot; area, then the input area times the input angle&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;Note to nitpickers: In 3D systems, this is technically the &lt;em&gt;solid angle&lt;/em&gt;, the 2D equivalent of the regular angle, but whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; equals the output area times the output angle. If your light is concentrated to a smaller output area, then it must be &quot;spread out&quot; over a larger output angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Punishable by up to 10 days in prison and a fine of up to $200.&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/etendue.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, you can't smoosh light beams together without also making them less parallel, which means you can't aim them at a faraway spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another way to think about this property of lenses: They only make light sources take up more of the sky; they can't make the light from any single spot brighter,&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;A popular demonstration of this: Try holding up a magnifying glass to a wall. The magnifying glass collects light from many parts of the wall and sends them to your eye, but it doesn't make the wall look brighter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; because it can be shown&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;This is left as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that making the light from a given direction brighter would violate the rules of étendue.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;My résumé says étendue is my forté.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In other words, all a lens system can do is make every line of sight end on the surface of a light source, which is equivalent to making the light source surround the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;illustration&quot; title=&quot;Today's weather forecast is really weird.&quot; src=&quot;https://what-if.xkcd.com/imgs/a/145/linesight.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're &quot;surrounded&quot; by the Sun's surface material, then you're effectively floating within the Sun, and will quickly reach the temperature of your surroundings.&lt;span class=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refnum&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;refbody&quot;&gt;(Very hot)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're surrounded by the bright surface of the Moon, what temperature will you reach? Well, rocks on the Moon's surface are nearly surrounded by the surface of the Moon, and they reach the temperature of the surface of the Moon (since they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the surface of the Moon.) So a lens system focusing moonlight can't really make something hotter than a well-placed rock sitting on the Moon's surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which gives us one last way to prove that you can't start a fire with moonlight: Buzz Aldrin is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AT&amp;T will put a fake 5G logo on its 4G LTE phones</title>
<link>https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/at-t-to-begin-upgrading-existing-lte-phones-to-5g-e</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/at-t-to-begin-upgrading-existing-lte-phones-to-5g-e</guid>
<description>&lt;div property=&quot;schema:articleBody&quot; readability=&quot;49.118219749652&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T confirmed to FierceWireless that it will soon begin changing the “LTE” indicator on some of its current Android phones to “5G E” in markets where the company now offers 4x4 MIMO, 256 QAM and other advanced LTE network technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“If they have one of the latest Android devices and it connects to a tower that’s enabled with 5G Evolution, they’ll soon see a “5G E” indicator pop up on their screen,” an AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson wrote in response to questions from FierceWireless. “Initially we’ll roll this out on a handful of devices, with more devices showing the indicator in spring 2019.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The operator didn’t immediately respond to questions about the total number of devices that would be affected by the change. However, potentially millions of existing LTE smartphone owners could eventually see their AT&amp;amp;T network status icon change from “LTE” to “5G E.” AT&amp;amp;T said its “5G Evolution” service will be commercially available in more than 400 markets by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

Such technologies can dramatically improve the speeds available through LTE, and AT&amp;amp;T has argued that such technologies pave the way for eventual 5G services, though critics have argued that AT&amp;amp;T’s “5G Evolution” marketing moves only serve to sow confusion among consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/at-t-defends-use-5g-evolution-branding-for-lte-service-promises-theoretical-speeds-up-to-1&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T defends use of ‘5G Evolution’ branding for LTE service, promises theoretical speeds up to 1 Gbps this year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s decision to change its “LTE” indicator to “5G E” has precedence. Sprint branded its WiMAX network as a 4G offering, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/at-t-chides-t-mobile-for-misleading-4g-marketing-hspa&quot;&gt;while T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; (and then later AT&amp;amp;T) both branded HSPA+ as 4G before the arrival of LTE. Those moves were notable considering the wireless industry widely regards LTE as the official 4G technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s “5G E” label will sit next to its “5G+” label, which the operator has applied to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/at-t-launches-mobile-5g-teases-plans-15-gb-for-70-month&quot;&gt;mobile 5G service launching today in 12 cities&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T’s “5G+” label applies to transmissions in the operator’s millimeter-wave spectrum. (AT&amp;amp;T’s initial mobile 5G launch will transmit signals in its 39 GHz licensed spectrum band across 100 MHz of spectrum and 2x2 MIMO antennas.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook open-sources a speech-recognition system and a machine learning library</title>
<link>https://code.fb.com/ai-research/wav2letter/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://code.fb.com/ai-research/wav2letter/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;WHAT THE RESEARCH IS:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new fully convolutional &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06864&quot;&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt; to automatic speech recognition and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07625&quot;&gt;wav2letter++&lt;/a&gt;, the fastest state-of-the-art end-to-end speech recognition system available. The approach leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for acoustic modeling and language modeling, and is reproducible, thanks to the toolkits we are releasing jointly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HOW IT WORKS:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN architectures are competitive with recurrent architectures for tasks in which modeling long-range dependencies is important, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08083&quot;&gt;language modeling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04956&quot;&gt;machine translation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/09/09/wavenet.pdf&quot;&gt;speech synthesis&lt;/a&gt;. In end-to-end speech recognition, however, recurrent architectures are still more prevalent for both acoustic and language modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook AI Research (FAIR) Speech team is sharing the first fully convolutional speech recognition system. From the waveform to the final word transcription, the learnable parts of the system are composed only of convolutional layers. This yields performance that’s competitive with that of recurrent architectures. &lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-12069 size-full&quot; data-src=&quot;https://code.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/fully_convolutional_ASR.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook AI Research (FAIR) Speech is sharing the first fully convolutional speech recognition system. From the waveform to the final word transcription, the learnable parts of the system are composed only of convolutional layers. This yields performance that's competitive with recurrent architectures.&quot; width=&quot;2000&quot; height=&quot;416&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also releasing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashlight&quot;&gt;flashlight&lt;/a&gt;, a fast, flexible standalone machine learning library designed by the FAIR Speech team and the creators of Torch and DeepSpeech. It features just-in-time compilation with modern C++, targeting both CPU and GPU backends for maximum efficiency and scale. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/wav2letter/&quot;&gt;wav2letter++ toolkit&lt;/a&gt; is built on top of flashlight. We are releasing both frameworks jointly with this research to enable reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WHY IT MATTERS:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-to-end speech recognition makes it easy to scale to multiple languages. Also, learning directly from raw speech is a promising avenue in settings where audio quality is highly variable. High-performance frameworks such as wav2letter++ enable fast iteration, which is often an important factor in successful research and model tuning on new data sets and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An Amoeba-Based Computer Found Solutions to 8-City Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gy7994/an-amoeba-based-computer-calculated-approximate-solutions-to-a-very-hard-math-problem</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gy7994/an-amoeba-based-computer-calculated-approximate-solutions-to-a-very-hard-math-problem</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A team of Japanese researchers from Keio University in Tokyo have demonstrated that an amoeba is capable of generating approximate solutions to a remarkably difficult math problem known as the “traveling salesman problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traveling salesman problem goes like this: Given an arbitrary number of cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest route a salesman can take that visits each city and returns to the salesman’s city of origin. It is a classic problem in computer science and is used as a benchmark test for optimization algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traveling salesman problem is considered “NP hard,” which means that the complexity of calculating a correct solution increases exponentially the more cities are added to the problem. For example, there are only three possible solutions if there are four cities, but there are 360 possible solutions if there are six cities. It continues to increase exponentially from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the exponential increase in computational difficulty with each city added to the salesman’s itinerary, computer scientists have been able to calculate the optimal solution to this problem for thousands of cities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crpc.rice.edu/newsletters/jan93/news.tsp.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;since the early 90s&lt;/a&gt; and recent efforts have been able to calculate nearly optimal solutions for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;millions of cities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amoebas are single-celled organisms without anything remotely resembling a central nervous system, which makes them seem like less than suitable candidates for solving such a complex puzzle. Yet as these Japanese researchers demonstrated, a certain type of amoeba can be used to calculate nearly optimal solutions to the traveling salesman problem for up to eight cities. Even more remarkably, the amount of time it takes the amoeba to reach these nearly optimal solutions grows linearly, even though the number of possible solutions increases exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As detailed in a paper published this week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.180396&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Royal Society Open Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the amoeba used by the researchers is called &lt;em&gt;Physarum polycephalum&lt;/em&gt;, which has been used as a biological computer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23713-slime-mould-could-make-memristors-for-biocomputers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;several other experiments&lt;/a&gt;. The reason this amoeba is considered especially useful in &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jpgdgd/engineers-develop-key-building-block-for-sophisticated-bio-computers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;biological computing&lt;/a&gt; is because it can extend various regions of its body to find the most efficient way to a food source and hates light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To turn this natural feeding mechanism into a computer, the Japanese researcher placed the amoeba on a special plate that had 64 channels that it could extend its body into. This plate is then placed on top of a nutrient rich medium. The amoeba tries to extend its body to cover as much of the plate as possible and soak up the nutrients. Yet each channel in the plate can be illuminated, which causes the light-averse amoeba to retract from that channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To model the traveling salesman problem, each of the 64 channels on the plate was assigned a city code between A and H, in addition to a number from 1 to 8 that indicates the order of the cities. So, for example, if the amoeba extended its body into the channels A3, B2, C4, and D1, the correct solution to the traveling salesman problem would be D, B, A, C, D. The reason for this is that D1 indicates that D should be the first city in the salesman’s itinerary, B2 indicates B should be the second city, A3 that A should be the third city and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To guide the amoeba toward a solution to the traveling salesman problem, the researchers used a neural network that would incorporate data about the amoeba’s current position and distance between the cities to light up certain channels. The neural network was designed such that cities with greater distances between them are more likely to be illuminated than channels that are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jpgdgd/engineers-develop-key-building-block-for-sophisticated-bio-computers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists Build a Biological Computer Inside a Cell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the algorithm manipulates the chip that the amoeba is on it is basically coaxing it into taking forms that represent approximate solutions to the traveling salesman problem. As the researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2018-12-amoeba-approximate-solutions-np-hard-problem.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told Phys.org&lt;/a&gt;, they expect that it would be possible to manufacture chips that contain tens of thousands of channels so that the amoeba is able to solve traveling salesman problems that involve hundreds of cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, however, the Japanese researchers’ experiment remains in the lab, but it provides the foundation for low-energy biological computers that harness the natural mechanisms of amoebas and other microorganisms to compute.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Burnout, stress lead more companies to try a four-day work week</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-world-work-fourdayweek/burnout-stress-lead-more-companies-to-try-a-four-day-work-week-idUSKBN1OG0GY</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-world-work-fourdayweek/burnout-stress-lead-more-companies-to-try-a-four-day-work-week-idUSKBN1OG0GY</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Corrects paragraph 4 to identify Perpetual Guardian as a trust company instead of an insurance company; corrects paragraph 13 to reflect that the study was conducted by Kronos and Future Workplace)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Emma Thomasson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Work four days a week, but get paid for five?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds too good to be true, but companies around the world that have cut their work week have found that it leads to higher productivity, more motivated staff and less burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is much healthier and we do a better job if we’re not working crazy hours,” said Jan Schulz-Hofen, founder of Berlin-based project management software company Planio, who introduced a four-day week to the company’s 10-member staff earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, trust company Perpetual Guardian reported a fall in stress and a jump in staff engagement after it tested a 32-hour week earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in Japan, the government is encouraging companies to allow Monday mornings off, although other schemes in the workaholic country to persuade employees to take it easy have had little effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain’s Trades Union Congress (TUC) is pushing for the whole country to move to a four-day week by the end of the century, a drive supported by the opposition Labour party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TUC argues that a shorter week is a way for workers to share in the wealth generated by new technologies like machine learning and robotics, just as they won the right to the weekend off during the industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would reduce the stress of juggling working and family life and could improve gender equality. Companies that have already tried it say it’s better for productivity and staff wellbeing,” said TUC economic head Kate Bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OVERWORKED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucie Greene, trends expert at consultancy J. Walter Thompson, said there was a growing backlash against overwork, underlined by a wave of criticism after Tesla (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_TSLA.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=TSLA.O&quot;&gt;TSLA.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) boss Elon Musk tweeted that “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People are starting to take a step back from the 24-hour digital life we have now and realize the mental health issues from being constantly connected to work,” Greene said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent survey of 3,000 employees in eight countries including the United States, Britain and Germany found that nearly half thought they could easily finish their tasks in five hours a day if they did not have interruptions, but many are exceeding 40 hours a week anyway - with the United States leading the way, where 49 percent said they worked overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There has been work creep. Because you always have the technology, you are always working, so people are getting burned out,” said Dan Schawbel, director of executive development firm Future Workplace, which conducted the survey with Kronos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schulz-Hofen, a 36-year-old software engineer, tested the four-day week on himself after realizing he needed to slow down following a decade of intense work launching Planio, whose tools allowed him to track his time in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t get less work done in four days than in five because in five days, you think you have more time, you take longer, you allow yourself to have more interruptions, you have your coffee a bit longer or chat with colleagues,” Schulz-Hofen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I realized with four days, I have to be quick, I have to be focused if I want to have my free Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schulz-Hofen and his team discussed various options before settling on everybody working Monday to Thursday. They rejected the idea of flexible hours because it adds administrative complexity, and were against a five-day week with shorter hours as it is too easy for overwork to creep back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients who call on a Friday hear a recorded message explaining why nobody is at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got an unexpected reaction from customers. Most of our clients did not complain. They were just jealous,” Schulz-Hofen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey New York, an ad agency owned by WPP (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_WPP.L_1”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=WPP.L&quot;&gt;WPP.L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), launched a program in April to allow staff to work a four-day week for 85 percent of their full-time salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schawbel expects the idea to catch on in more companies and countries, but probably not his own: “I think America will be the last country to give us Monday mornings off because we’re so used to this way of working.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Brave taking cryptocurrency donations “for me” without my consent</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Re: GDPR, I mean creators, not Brave users. If a domain owner, channel owner, or similar sends you a RTBF request, can those assigned donations be reverted and the records of which domain/channel/other personal identifier they were assigned to be removed?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Evaluation of five password managers</title>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d7df&quot; id=&quot;d7df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’ve used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lastpass.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.lastpass.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LastPass password manager&lt;/a&gt; at home and at work for eight and a half years, since only a couple years after they launched, so it makes sense that when I came to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantopian.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.quantopian.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quantopian&lt;/a&gt; as its VP of Operations (and later CISO), I brought LastPass with me and we adopted it as our corporate password manager. For several years, we were happy with LastPass as a product and with the quality of support provided by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5b84&quot; id=&quot;5b84&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, in 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/10/lastpass-joins-logmein.html/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/10/lastpass-joins-logmein.html/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LogMeIn acquired LastPass&lt;/a&gt;, and things started to change. We have been increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of the product and its support since the acquisition, until recently we finally decided to spend some time evaluating alternatives to LastPass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;efb7&quot; id=&quot;efb7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We created a detailed evaluation checklist and ran five password managers through the gauntlet: LastPass, &lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dashlane.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.dashlane.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitwarden.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://bitwarden.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://keepersecurity.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://keepersecurity.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of our evaluation, we decided that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Bitwarden is the best choice for our company&lt;/strong&gt;, and we’ve begun the process of migrating from LastPass to Bitwarden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e379&quot; id=&quot;e379&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Obviously, our priorities and requirements might not be the same as yours, so what follows is a description of the functionality and features we focused on in our evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fad8&quot; id=&quot;fad8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Even if our priorities are different from yours, you can still benefit from our evaluation! Included below is an interactive grid which you can tweak to focus on just the requirements you care about and then pit any two of the five products we looked at head-to-head and see how they fare against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;486a&quot; id=&quot;486a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Quantopian’s password-management priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5d5f&quot; id=&quot;5d5f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We use our password manager on Mac OS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. Our password manager needs to support all of those platforms. Most importantly, full functionality can’t be dependent on an app which is only available on Mac OS and/or Windows. In other words, lack of full Linux support is a show-stopper for us. This ruled out 1Password and Dashlane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72d1&quot; id=&quot;72d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We have recently begun the process of issuing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YubiKeys&lt;/a&gt; to all of our employees and requiring the use of the YubiKey for two-factor authentication for all applications and services which support it. Therefore, although we didn’t consider YubiKey support to be a hard-and-fast requirement for our new password manager, it was a factor. Certainly, any password manager which lacked any support for 2fa would have been rejected out-of-hand. Fortunately, all five products we looked at support some form of 2fa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e3e6&quot; id=&quot;e3e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We encourage our employees to use a password manager for their personal passwords in addition to their work passwords, and we want to make that easy. Despite the various problems we’ve had with LastPass, we have to acknowledge that their “linked personal account” functionality is the gold standard for solving this particular problem, so we evaluated the other products to see how their solution to this problem compared. Dashlane and Keeper have poor solutions to this problem; the others are adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d76c&quot; id=&quot;d76c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Obviously, since we were going to be migrating from LastPass to a new service, the ability to import our LastPass data into the new service was essential. Fortunately, all the products we evaluated had this capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f89&quot; id=&quot;5f89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A number of features we looked at are only relevant in an enterprise (i.e., business) environment. For example, for just personal use, you probably won’t care about linked personal accounts, fine-grained access control, or what abilities company administrators have, but all of these questions were important to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16c1&quot; id=&quot;16c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s important to us that our password manager is actively maintained, and that the people maintaining it are responsive to support inquiries, feature requests, and bug reports. We definitely found that to be the case with Bitwarden. For example, at one point during our evaluation we submitted a bug report about Bitwarden through its Github project; one of the product’s maintainers committed a bug fix &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;seventeen minutes later,&lt;/em&gt; and just a few days after that the fix was released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;9ab9&quot; id=&quot;9ab9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Interactive head-to-head evaluation grid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1f1c&quot; id=&quot;1f1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;To see the evaluation table, click on the “Result” tab in the embed below. Initially, all of the checklist items we considered in our evaluation are listed in the table. If you scroll to the bottom, you will see a list of feature tags. Uncheck the features you don’t care about, and they will be removed from the grid. Then, you can select any two products from the two drop-down menus at the bottom, and the grid will add a column doing a head-to-head comparison of those two products with an overall score at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
