<description>&lt;div id=&quot;i2sRriF&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Finished project first! I decided sometime last year that I wanted to make a smart watch from scratch. I am an electrical engineer and product designer by day, so this was a fun side project that had been rolling around in my head for a while now. Also, this project is full open sourced, the below repo has all of the build files you would need to make your own: - Circuit board files - Schematics - Bill of Materials - All the code - STL files for all the prints github.com/S-March/smarchWatch_PUBLIC I hope you guys enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;n7U0zQW&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Another glamour shot of the finished watch. This is what the time looks like when you raise your wrist. I decided a background of leaves/flowers went nice with the wood* housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;Dn2HZKw&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;37.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Ok, on to the design! First up, this is a quick gif of the top side of the watch being designed in Fusion 360. The program is free for hobbyist and is definitely powerful enough for anything I needed. I tried openSCAD for an earlier version of the watch, and although I liked it, it just couldn't compete with this. I decided early on that I wanted a round watch. I'm not a fan of the square or squarcle watches that seem to be all over these days. Something about that shape felt too 1980's computer-y to me. From a technical point of view, it is definitely easier to make something that isn't round. Square screens are much easier to come by and have more space to show you more stuff. The reality, however, is I don't want another phone or computer on my wrist. I just want something to show me important bits of information when I need them. The shape of this particular watch was primarily driven by the screen I ended up using (which can be found in the bill of materials). It is a teardrop shape, where the actual display is round, but there are some additional electronics parts that add to the size. So you can see above, the square parts on the top and bottom where the band connects to the watch are actually there to hide the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;sgMUql8&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the bottom part of the watch. You can see the cutouts inside for the battery, vibration motor and charging pins. There are also two small holes that are used for screwing the circuit board down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;8o2VrJJ&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;A rendered version of the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;5CCSVml&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;A rendered version of the bottom. Note the yellow piece on the right hand side. That is the screen connector. It folds over itself and plugs into the circuit board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;coFd7Xb&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Another quick render of the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;x8KDOcU&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Ok, on to the fun stuff! I have a little cheap monoprice printer here at home, it is awesome for stuff like this. I printed out the two pieces of the housing I designed above out of a woodfill PLA. What that means, is that the plastic I used to print this out, is actually 70% plastic and 30% saw dust. The cool thing about woodfill plastic, is that it behaves very similarly to actual wood. It sands down really nicely and you can stain it with wood stains! The downside to this particular type of plastic is that when it prints, it leaves a stringy mess on the print that you have to clean up. I use a file and some 220 grit sandpaper to get it started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;4KJgRMu&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Next up is just a quick test to make sure the screen and the watch glass fit nicely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;0M3xIil&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;32.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here are the three stages of the 3D print. Bottom left is fresh off the printer, you can see the stringy mess I was talking about. The middle is a sanded down print. And the top right is after the sanded print has been dunked in a dark walnut stain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;bfm6AVL&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;37.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The next 9 pictures may be a little boring if you have no interest in the actual electronics of the smart watch (you can feel free to skip them). If you are curious as to what makes this thing tick, I will do my absolute best to describe everything in a non-technical way. When designing a schematic (think blueprints) for any sort of electronics, I try to break down all my big parts of the design into smaller blocks. This first page of the schematics is what I call the &quot;Main&quot; page. All it is, is a quick overview of the blocks that make this watch work, and how they connect to each other. So as you can see, in this particular design there are four blocks: The power block - this is the section that deals with the battery and making sure the watch has power The sensors block - this what tells the watch what is going on around it (think eyes and ears) The actuators block - this is the part of the watch that interacts with the world (think moving parts, like your legs or arms) The BLE block - this is the section that controls the whole thing, it is the brains of the operation. I probably should have labeled this better, but it was originally just meant for my eyes only. BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy, it is the same bluetooth that is in your phones. If people are more interested in how the electronics actually work, I can add a more detailed explanation of these next few pictures. I will link to it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;RTHzzQO&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;First up, the power block. As you can see, just like in the last picture, I try to break down things into smaller and smaller pieces. For this particular block, we don't need much. We need the battery itself, the charger contacts, and some protection for the battery. Whenever we work with lithium ion batteries (the same type that are in almost anything rechargeable), we have to be very careful. The batteries themselves pack a lot of energy into something very small. If they short circuit or are damaged in any way, they can blow up with in a matter of seconds. The battery protection block on this page just makes sure the battery is never over-charged, under-charged or short circuited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;6zYNFZG&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Second, the sensors. This particular design only has one extra sensor: an accelerometer. All an accelerometer does is measure, you guessed it, acceleration. If you remember back to your high school physics class days, you may recall that gravity is actually just a downwards acceleration. So with that in mind, if you can measure which way is down, you can figure out which direction the watch is pointing (up/down/left/right/front/back). And if we know which direction the watch is facing, then we can design the watch to only turn the screen on when you hold the watch up and its facing you. You may notice the other block in this section (I2C pullups). I2C stands for inter-intergrated circuit, all it is, is a way for chips to talk to one another. The pullups are just to make sure the I2C communications work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ufXmfBx&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The actuators section is dedicated entirely to ways the watch can interact with the world around it, in this case the screen and the vibration motor. The screen is an LCD (liquid crystal display) which is the same as a lot of phones and TVs. It is 240 pixels tall by 240 pixels wide. What this means is there are 240x240 individually controlled colored dots on a big grid. Think of it like those kids toys (lite-brites), where you can plug in different colored dots to make a picture. That is all this display is doing. The vibration motor is exactly what it sounds like, a motor that vibrates. This is used to let me know when I get a new notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;YfsBpGR&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the meat and potatoes of the watch. The Dialog Semiconductor DA14683 chip. It is a microcontroller (the brain) and it has bluetooth built in to it! There is some additional memory on the circuit board so that the watch can store pictures (people in my contacts, backgrounds, etc.). And what is called a pi-network for the antenna. I won't get into the details of the antenna stuff here, but even for most electrical engineers this stuff is black magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;TB7X2RK&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The next four pictures are the actual circuit board. This is where we take the schematic, and all the blocks we designed and make them into physical board. Circuit boards are made up of two things: copper and fiberglass. The copper is the part that makes the electrical connections between all the parts. So for example, the microcontroller (brain) is connected to the accelerometer over a copper trace (thin line of copper). But sometimes, you can manage to connect everything without needing to cross over another trace. Think of this like a maze, where if you touch the side, everything short-circuits. So what we can do is connect multiple layers of copper and stack them on top of one another (with fiberglass in between). That way we can have a trace that connects the microcontroller to the memory without having to cross the path of the vibration motor. This first picture is the &quot;top&quot; layer of the circuit board, it has stuff like the microcontroller and the memory on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;uFNteg0&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This next picture is the second layer from the top. It is just used to connect stuff. No parts can go here since it is sandwiched in between fiberglass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;aasQjLV&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the third layer, similar to the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;kgKchci&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;This is the bottom layer of the circuit board. On this side, we can put more parts, so things like the battery and vibration motor are all connected here. That concludes the boring electrical stuff. Back to the fun build pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;0aEOEVA&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Ok, welcome back to the people that skipped over the boring stuff! This is the finished circuit board. After I finished the design, I put all the files together and sent them over to a PCB manufacturer. They then take those files and print (with a super high resolution printer) on to some copper. They can then etch away the copper that isn't used and voila! Circuit boards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;uebRGfV&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;After getting the circuit board I just did a quick fit check with the printed parts from before. The bottom part of the watch is the part that holds the circuit board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;tOZJHdo&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Then the top part of the watch just presses down on to that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;RI2XoyG&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Once the circuit board checked out size-wise, it was time to put all the chips and stuff on. I unfortunately forgot to get a cool time-lapse of this process, so the gif below is me assembling an older version of the smart watch that didn't have a screen. At least it will give you an idea of how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;GCHzeyM&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here is how assembling a circuit boards works. First, in addition to the actual bare circuit board, it helps to have a stencil made. The stencil will have cutouts for solder paste. This goop is, in essence, tiny beads of solder that are suspended in a paste. So, once you have your circuit board, put in on a flat surface (I like to tape it down so it doesn't move). Next, tape the stencil on top. Spread the solder past out with something like an old credit card. After all the holes in the stencil are filled with the paste, take the stencil off (very carefully). Then, the fun part, using tweezers, pick up and put down all the little chips and parts on the board. Once all the parts are on the board, un-tape the circuit board, and pop it in the reflow oven (basically a fancy toaster oven) for about 8 minutes. All those tiny beads of solder will melt and turn into solid metal connections holding everything in place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;ypRp4mt&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Next up, the actual assembly! The board gets screwed down into the bottom housing. Those two golden squares at the top with the holes in them are the charging pads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;uvETY3T&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Next up the glass and screen are placed into the top housing. A nice snug fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;PhQNpXk&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Connecting the screen to the circuit board is as simple plugging it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;tM8hO92&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Last but not least, flip the top part over and press it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;8ckcVR4&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Because who doesn't love a short gif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;GPQdxF4&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here is the final thing all buttoned up and coded. When I raise my wrist, it shows the time. I won't bore people with the running through the code (there is a LOT of it). If people want to know more about it, I can add a more detailed review and link it here. A quick summary of some of the things I had to do: - Get bluetooth working and talking to my phone - Implement an Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) so that my phone would forward notifications to my watch - Get the microcontroller to talk to the screen (this took SO long) - Get the screen to display pixels - Design animations for the screen - Get the microcontroller talking to the memory - Write a windows program to open a folder of pictures on my desktop, crop them to a square, downsize them to 240x240 pixels, convert them to a bitmap, strip out the bitmap header, change the endianness of the bytes, put all the data into one long hex file and then transmit that hex file over UART to the watch - Write a function to take the picture data from the UART stream, and put it into memory with offsets that were readily available - Hand draw a 240 by 240 picture that contained all letters and numbers in upper and lower case, then get the microcontroller to slice that image up depending on which letter or number it needed to display (so if you wanted to right &quot;HELLO&quot; it would find the &quot;H&quot; in the picture, send it to the screen, then find the &quot;E&quot; do the same thing, etc.) - Get the accelerometer to wake up the microcontroller only when the wrist was in the right position so it used minimal battery power - Write a contacts function that would parse the notification for who the sender was and return the offset in memory of where their contact picture was - Many many more things...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;PknL3xV&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;When I get a notification on my phone, it comes through my watch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;78M4NIG&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;BONUS CONTENT!!! You thought I would stop at just a watch?! Nope, had to make a charging cradle for it too! Here is a quick gif of how it assembles. I designed another small circuit board that has a micro-USB plug and some spring contacts. When the watch is laid into the cradle a big magnet holds it in place and the spring contacts send power to the watch to charge the battery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;w9pMIve&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here is the magnet pulling the watch into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;OfiKZQa&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Finish the whole thing up with the same glamour shots from earlier! This is what the watch looks like when I get a notification. First it shows a picture of who the message is from (along with what application) followed by the message itself. That is me sending a text to myself from google voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;7Ham6j8&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot; readability=&quot;34.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-image-meta post-image-meta--last&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-image-description&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Hope you guys liked it. I know it is a lot of really technical info, but I had an absolute blast making the watch (and I think it came out pretty nice looking)! The github link at the top has all of the circuit files, bill of materials, schematic, code, and STLs if you want to make your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Have a personal web site</title>
<link>https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/?c=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/?c=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! This is my personal web site. It’s not much, but it’s mine. After nearly a decade of just barely existing, I’ve spent quite a bit of time in 2019 trying to breathe new life into it. At this point, I think just about everyone–but especially folks in the software engineering universe–should have a personal web site of their own. Let me tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I walked into an interview with a candidate at work and introduced myself. The candidate was pleasant enough, and one of the first things they say to me was that they like to look people up before an interview to try to get to know them a bit. “You were a complete ghost online.”, they said.&lt;a class=&quot;fn-link&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been active on the internet since the mid 90s, and I’ve probably cumulatively written hundreds of thousands of words on here in one way or another. I blogged nearly every day through the first half of the 2000s, and I was a noisy contributor on Twitter back when it was a fun, quirky distraction. Since about 2012, though, real life and relatively intense day jobs as a software engineer had taken away the interest in continuing to work on web stuff in my free time. Eventually, I eventually grew tired of the big internet sites, deleting my LinkedIn account (too many emails, dangit), abandoning Reddit, shutting down my Twitter presence, and deleting my Facebook content. All that was left of me online was a dusty corner of the web, forgotten&lt;a class=&quot;fn-link&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t say anything to the candidate, but I was a little unsettled by this revelation. Over the holiday break at the end of 2018, I decided to do something about it. I vowed to revive my personal web site and publish at least one substantial post per month, focusing on a topic that was always sure to keep my interest: vintage video game history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve made my goal. I’ve got four 2,000+ word articles up that I’m quite proud of, and each one is easier to put together than the one before. Writing is a lot easier if you practice, and having an audience–even if it’s mostly imagined–is a pretty good motivator to keep at it. I’m also fortunate to have a patient wife who happens to be taking a course in copyediting right now, which means my writing practice can become her editing practice. It’s been a pretty great bit of synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m by no means an expert on, well, anything, but I can crank out a post that I’m proud of pretty quickly. I like to write things out in a few big chunks, let them sit for a while, and do a few clean up passes before calling it a day and pushing it out. This isn’t just helping me become a better writer: I’m getting better at reading and editing other people’s writing as well, which definitely comes in handy at a large software company with technical proposals flying by all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s more to a web site than filling it with content. In my day job, I have the good fortune of spending my time deep in the guts of a large client-side JavaScript application. I’m far removed from designing user interfaces and writing CSS, and this is definitely a benefit to our customers. However, just because I don’t want to work with HTML and CSS on a daily basis doesn’t mean I want my skills to completely atrophy. This web site is just complex enough to give me a playground: I think it looks relatively nice, and it’s been a good opportunity to remind myself how CSS works. I’ve made some nice layouts for articles that I’m pretty pleased with&lt;a class=&quot;fn-link&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m slowly chipping away at the terrible HTML &amp;amp; CSS I threw together here in 2012. A few of the things I’ve learned about (or reminded myself about) so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;semantic markup with modern HTML elements like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fn-link&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accessibility best practices for article-based web sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how Slack unfurls work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to design web sites that respect the notch on iPhone X and friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to use GitHub webhooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to write Jekyll plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to embed videos in multiple formats that gracefully degrade down to being images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web site performance optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome’s performance and accessibility auditing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Search Console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to manipulate text using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing reliable, readable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; scripts&lt;a class=&quot;fn-link&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on. Some of this overlaps with the stuff I deal with professionally, and some of it doesn’t. But when I touch an internal tool like this at work, I have to make sure I’m building something rock solid: hundreds of other people will use whatever it is tens of thousands of times, and even a bug that happens 1% of the time would be unacceptably high. Here? Whatever works. It’s freeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion: go for it. The best thing about the web circa 2019 is how huge it is. You’re not going to embarass yourself: just dig in and start building something. By the time anyone notices–if they ever do–you’ll probably be pretty pleased with what you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is pretty common, at least in my experience–plenty of people have told me that they looked me up before their interview. It’s actually a pretty nice signal that people are invested enough in the process to do some prep ahead of time. &lt;a class=&quot;fn-return&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-link-1&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Same basic layout, but a lot less polished. &lt;a class=&quot;fn-return&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-link-2&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This originally said &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sidebar&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, because that’s what I was using in my markup. Turns out I was using a fictious element by accident; many thanks to Petar Petrovic for pointing that out. &lt;a class=&quot;fn-return&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-link-4&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; My usage of both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; was in service of trying to get better at using these fundamental tools. Usually, I reach for Ruby whenever I’m doing anything non-trivial in the terminal–it’s my favourite language for shell scripting and command line tools. &lt;a class=&quot;fn-return&quot; href=&quot;https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/#fn-link-5&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Can’t Answer Standardized Test Questions About My Own Poems (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/standardized-tests-are-so-bad-i-cant-answer-these_b_586d5517e4b0c3539e80c341</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.huffpost.com/entry/standardized-tests-are-so-bad-i-cant-answer-these_b_586d5517e4b0c3539e80c341</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;35.816860465116&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I realized I couldn’t answer the questions posed about two of my own poems on the Texas state assessment tests &lt;a href=&quot;http://tea.texas.gov/Student_Testing_and_Accountability/Testing/State_of_Texas_Assessments_of_Academic_Readiness_(STAAR)/STAAR_Released_Test_Questions/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(STAAR Test&lt;/a&gt;), I had a flash of panic – oh, no! Not smart enough. Such a dunce. My eyes glazed over. I checked to see if anyone was looking. The questions began to swim on the page. Waves of insecurity. My brain in full spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two poems in question are &lt;em&gt;A REAL CASE,&lt;/em&gt; appearing on the 2014 Grade 7 STAAR Reading Test, and MIDNIGHT, appearing on the 2013 Grade 8 STAAR Reading Test. Both poems originally appeared in &lt;u&gt;Walking on the Boundaries of Change,&lt;/u&gt; Boyds Mills Press, 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me begin by confessing that &lt;em&gt;A REAL CASE&lt;/em&gt; is my most neurotic poem. I have a pile of them to be sure, but this one is the sour cherry on top. The written evidence of my anxieties, those evil gremlins that ride around on tricycles in my mind shooting my self-confidence with water pistols. How in the name of all that’s moldy did &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; poem wind up on a proficiency test?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dose of reality:&lt;/strong&gt; test makers are for-profit organizations. My poems are a whole lot cheaper than Mary Oliver’s or Jane Kenyon’s, so there’s that. But how would your vulnerable, nervous, number two pencil-gripping seventh grade self have felt opening your test packet to analyze poetic lines such as this: &lt;em&gt;I’m just down with a sniffly case/of sudden-self-loathing-syndrome…an unexpected extra serving/ of just-for-now-self-hate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously? Hundreds of my poems in print and they choose &lt;em&gt;THAT&lt;/em&gt; one? Self-loathing and self-hate? Kids need an extra serving of those emotions on testing day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize to those kids. I apologize to their teachers. Boy howdy, I apologize to the entire state of Texas. I know the ‘90s were supposed to be some kind of golden age, but I had my bad days and, clearly, these words are the pan drippings of one of them. Did I have a purpose for writing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does survival count?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers are also trying to survive as they are tasked with teaching kids how to take these tests, which they do by digging through past tests, posted online. Forget joy of language and the fun of discovery in poetry, this is line-by-line dissection, painful and delivered without anesthetic. One teacher wrote to me last month, working after 10 p.m., trying to figure out the test maker’s interpretation of my poem &lt;em&gt;MIDNIGHT&lt;/em&gt;, This poem isn’t quite as jarring as &lt;em&gt;A REAL CASE&lt;/em&gt;, simply symptomatic of aforementioned neuroses: It’s about insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hello Mrs. Holbrook. My name is Sean, and I’m an 8th grade English teacher in Texas. I’m attempting to decipher the number of stanzas in your poem, ‘Midnight’. This isn’t clear from the formatting in our most recent benchmark. The assessment asks the following question:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Dividing the poem into two stanzas allows the poet to―&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A) compare the speaker’s schedule with the train’s schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B ) ask questions to keep the reader guessing about what will happen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C) contrast the speaker’s feelings about weekends and Mondays&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;D) incorporate reminders for the reader about where the action takes place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The answer is C) to contrast the speaker’s feelings about weekends and Mondays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How many stanzas are in this poem? Where are they located? I would appreciate your help. Thank you so much!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, goody. I’m a benchmark. Only guess what? The test prep materials neglected to insert the stanza break. I texted him an image of how the poem appeared in the original publication. Problem one solved. But guess what else? I just put that stanza break in there because when I read it aloud (I’m a performance poet), I pause there. Note: that is not an option among the answers because no one ever asked me why I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These test questions were just made up, and tragically, incomprehensibly, kids’ futures and the evaluations of their teachers will be based on their ability to guess the so-called correct answer to made up questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went online and searched Holbrook/MIDNIGHT/Texas and the results were terrifying. Dozens of districts, all dissecting this poem based on poorly formatted test prep materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;content-list-component pull-quote&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;These test questions were just made up, and tragically, incomprehensibly, kids’ futures and the evaluations of their teachers will be based on their ability to guess the so-called correct answer to made up questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas, please know, this was not the author’s purpose in writing this poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this article is a question-by-question breakdown of the test questions on A REAL CASE and my thinking as I attempted to answer them. But fair warning:  &lt;em&gt;Your&lt;/em&gt; eyes are going to glaze over as you read through them. But try to hang in there. Pretend your future depends on it. That you might not be promoted into the next grade with all the other kids your height and will have to remain in seventh for the rest of your life if you don’t pass. Seventh grade! That muddy trough where kids try to keep afloat clinging to the wispy thread of: &lt;em&gt;This won’t last forever.&lt;/em&gt;  But if you don’t pass this blamed (blaming) test, it just might. Oh no!  Put a pencil between your teeth, bite down, and open your test packet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meantime, here is my question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Does this guessing game mostly evidence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;    the literacy mastery of the student?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;    the competency of the student’s teacher?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;    the absurdity of the questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;    the fact that the poet, although she has never put her head in an oven, definitely has issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go with &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; since I definitely have issues, including issues with these ridiculous test questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;35.923404255319&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same year that MIDNIGHT appeared on the STAAR test (2013), Texas paid Pearson some &lt;a href=&quot;http://kut.org/post/what-s-texas-500-million-testing-contract-pearson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$500 million bucks to administer the tests&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly without proper training to monitor the contract. Test scorers, who are routinely hired from ads on (where else?), Craiglist, also receive scant training, as reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://monthlyreview.org/2010/12/01/the-loneliness-of-the-long-distance-test-scorer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this seasoned test scorer.&lt;/a&gt; I’m not sure what the qualifications are for the people who make up the questions, but the ability to ride unicorns comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;31.222748815166&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes research that reveals that a simple demographic study of the wealth of the parents could have accurately predicted the outcomes, no desks or test packets needed.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/good-news-we-can-cancel-t_b_13572778?section=us_education&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Educator/author Peter Greene&lt;/a&gt; reports,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Put another way, Tienken et. al. have demonstrated that we do not need to actually give the Common Core-linked Big Standardized Test in order to generate the “student achievement” data, because we can generate the same data by looking at demographic information all by itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tienken and his team used just three pieces of demographic data—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) percentage of families in the community with income over $200K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) percentage of people in the community in poverty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) percentage of people in community with bachelor’s degrees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using that data alone, Tienken was able to predict school district test results accurately in most cases.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;36.830769230769&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, technically Texas does not adhere to the Common Core, but since their tests are written and administered by the same sadistic behemoth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pearsonaccess.com/cs/Satellite?pagename=Pearson/QuickLink/tx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pearson,&lt;/a&gt; it’s fair to draw some parallels. At least as fair as (say) those made-up questions about my neurotic poems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard the campaign promises to eliminate the Common Core made by Donald Trump, I thought, &lt;em&gt;yeah, right. Wait until someone educates him on how much money is being made making kids miserable with these useless tests.&lt;/em&gt; Talk is cheap. School testing is big bucks, and those testers are not going down without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop it. Just stop it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to stop this nonsense is for parents to stand up and say, no more. No more will I let my kid be judged by random questions scored by slackers from Craigslist while I pay increased taxes for results that could just as easily have been predicted by an algorithm. That’s not education, that’s idiotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t drag you through the entire dissection of my poem MIDNIGHT, just the concluding stanza:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . And I meander to its rhythm,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flopping like a fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can’t I get to sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can’t I get to sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 The poet uses a simile in lines 23 and 24 to reveal that the speaker —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F  &lt;/strong&gt;wants to be outside &lt;strong&gt;G  &lt;/strong&gt;cannot get comfortable &lt;strong&gt;H  &lt;/strong&gt;does not like fishing &lt;strong&gt;J   &lt;/strong&gt;might be having a dream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say &lt;strong&gt;G, H&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;.  I can’t get comfortable with any of this, it all seems like a bad dream (which indeed can keep me awake) and correct, I don’t like fishing (ick, worms). But fishing through school testing is even creepier than a fistful of worms, especially when it’s mislabeled as a legitimate measure of student and teacher competency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parents, educators, legislators, readers of news reports:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;STOP TAKING THESE TEST RESULTS SERIOUSLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiotic, hair-splitting questions pertaining to nothing, insufficient training, profit-driven motives on the part of the testing companies, and test results that simply reveal the income and education level of the parents – For this we need to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and waste 10-45 days of classroom time each year to administer them? More if you consider the amount of days spent in test prep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What creative ideas might Sean have been cooking up at 10 p.m. on a cold Wednesday night to excite his kids about reading and learning if he hadn’t been wandering down this loopy labyrinth? Would he have been drafting a lesson plan for those kids to develop their writing and communication skills through writing their own poetry? Maybe he just would have been catching an extra hour of sleep to feel energized for the colossal task he is faced with everyday, turning on adolescents to reading, writing, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe by leading kids to poetry instead of force feeding it to them, Sean could have helped them sort through their own neuroses, helping to become better adults and see themselves as something other than a test score, as &lt;em&gt;worthless as a leftover bath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can’t know that, because at 10 p.m. on December 13, 2016, Sean was writing to me, trying to decipher misleading test prep materials he’d been handed to ready his kids for a test they will take sometime next spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may be neurotic, but this is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, what do I know. I can’t answer the questions on my own poetry. Read below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d5d53150000a205e9e7a1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span aria-label=&quot;Image credit: STARR Test, Grade 7 2014&quot; class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;STARR Test, Grade 7 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s take these questions one at a time:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Which lines from the poem best suggest that the speaker’s situation is temporary?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; Doubtful,/I have a fever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; Tomorrow,/I’ll come around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; TODAY!/It hit like a thwop of mashed potatoes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt; I could attract mosquitoes—/maybe—not friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m guessing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;G,&lt;/strong&gt; but I could make a pretty good argument for &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; as it (all caps) belongs to today. Mustn’t overthink this, clock’s ticking. Let’s go with &lt;strong&gt;G.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is the most likely reason that the poet uses capitalization in line 6?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; To highlight a problem the speaker experiences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; To stress the speaker’s expectations for tomorrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; To indicate that the speaker’s condition happens unexpectedly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; To show the speaker’s excitement about an upcoming event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;. All caps is a way to highlight a fact, right? I guess I wanted to stress the fact that the feeling belongs to TODAY, but maybe the answer is &lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s see, today is not tomorrow, could be that. But climbing into the test maker’s mind, I’m guessing they want the answer &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;. But here’s the thing: I remember adding the ALL CAPS during revision. Was it to highlight the fact it arrived today or was it to indicate that it happened unexpectedly? Not sure. Move on, lots to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Read the following lines from the poem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poet includes these lines most likely suggest the speaker –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; does not wish to be pushed on a swing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; wants to deal with the situation alone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; does not often receive help from others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt; is not physically strong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Definitely &lt;strong&gt;F.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t like being pushed around, especially on a mood swing. Or maybe &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;, clearly the speaker doesn’t want anyone in her space, pushing her around. Right? &lt;strong&gt;F, G&lt;/strong&gt;, or wait, how about &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;? Exactly. Pushing me around when I’m in a mood is not helpful, but people do that all the time. Cheer up. Get that look off your face. Not helpful. &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt; is just stupid, but is it a trick? (What happened to choice &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;? Where is I? Who am &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The imagery in lines 16 through 19 helps the reader understand –&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; the shift in the speaker’s attitude&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; the speaker’s unpleasantness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; why the speaker has no friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; what the speaker thinks of others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;, all of the above? &lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Incoming dog breath has no friends. That’s obvious. Or &lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Unpleasant yes, but that’s kind of an understatement. And of course there’s an argument to be made for &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;, I did shift into this mood TODAY. It wasn’t there yesterday. I obviously am not thinking much about others, that’s true (&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;), I was pretty much into myself and I was having a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 The poet reveals the speaker’s feelings mainly by –&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt; using similes and metaphors to describe them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; explaining their effect on others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; connecting them to memories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt; repeating specific words for emphasis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now I really need that all above option. Yes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;, using similes and metaphors in description. Righto&lt;strong&gt;. G&lt;/strong&gt;, the phrase “could attract mosquitoes, not friends” is a pretty sure indicator my lousy mood had a bad effect on others. &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;? How else except through memory would I conjure up nasty dog breath and a terminal case of split ends? And then there’s &lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;, repeated words (today, today, today). This one was the real stumper. Total guessing game on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My final reflection is this&lt;/strong&gt;: any test that questions the motivations of the author without asking the author is a big baloney sandwich. Mostly test makers do this to dead people who can’t protest. But I’m not dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-list-component yr-content-list-text text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is that this new system will offer robust high-speed Internet, especially in developing countries and rural parts of developed nations like the United States. While you may not be running out to buy this if you have fiber Internet, it could bring true wireless Internet options to Americans who currently have no real options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This approval underscores the FCC’s confidence in SpaceX’s plans to deploy its next-generation satellite constellation and connect people around the world with reliable and affordable broadband service,” SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX has already launched several test satellites to prove the system works. Now they have permission to move forward with a larger rollout of 4,425 satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system also promises to help relief efforts that currently spend hundreds of dollars a day for 5 Mbps Internet. With this system, relief workers can access high speed Internet even in areas hit by a major disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Belgian programmer solves MIT’s 20-year-old time capsule cryptographic puzzle</title>
<link>https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/belgian-programmer-solves-mits-20-year-old-cryptographic-puzzle</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/belgian-programmer-solves-mits-20-year-old-cryptographic-puzzle</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) announced that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/lcs35-puzzle-description.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a 20-year-old cryptographic puzzle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;was just solved by a self-taught programmer from Belgium, 15 years earlier than MIT scientists expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bernard Fabrot spent the last three and a half years computing the solution to a puzzle first announced by MIT researchers in 1999. Separately, another team led by tech executive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supranational.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Simon Peffers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is nearing completion of computing a solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The puzzle essentially involves doing roughly 80 trillion successive squarings of a starting number, and was specifically designed to foil anyone trying to solve it more quickly by using parallel computing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fabrot and Peffers took very different approaches to the puzzle. Fabrot used a simple Intel Core i7-6700 found in consumer PCs, and computed the solution using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). Meanwhile, Peffers' team used a novel squaring algorithm (designed by Erdinç Öztürk from Sabanci University) to run on a programmable hardware accelerator called an FPGA. The team, which is working as part of a collaboration called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptophage.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cryptophage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is on track to finish the puzzle on May 11 after only two months of computation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There have been hardware and software advances beyond what I predicted in 1999,” says MIT professor Ron Rivest, who first announced the puzzle in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/lcs35-puzzle-description.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;April 1999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;tied to a celebration of 35 years of research at MIT’s Laboratory for Computer Science (now CSAIL). “The puzzle’s fundamental challenge of doing roughly 80 trillion squarings remains unbroken, but the resources required to do a single squaring have been reduced by much more than I predicted.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The puzzle is an example of a “verifiable delay function” (VDF), meaning that its answer can only be solved after a certain number of steps. Because VDFs can also be used to create unbiased randomness, they’ve been proposed as potential approaches to improve the security and scalability of blockchain systems like Ethereum and Filecoin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the original announcement, LCS promised that, if a correct solution was uncovered, they would open a special “time capsule” designed by architect Frank Gehry and filled with historical artifacts from the likes of Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, Ethernet co-inventor Bob Metcalfe, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. (Gates donated the original Altair BASIC that represented&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itworld.com/article/2872659/the-source-code-behind-microsoft-basic-for-6502-comes-to-light.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft’s first-ever product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which they developed for MITS in 1975.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The capsule ceremony will happen Wednesday, May 15 at 4 p.m. at MIT’s Stata Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WeWork Files for IPO</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/business/dealbook/wework-ipo-filing.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/business/dealbook/wework-ipo-filing.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Over nine years, WeWork has grown from one work space in Manhattan into a global empire of trendily designed shared offices, business services and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now WeWork is hoping that public investors believe the company can eventually turn a profit from that vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190429005696/en/Company-Announces-Confidential-Submission-Draft-Registration-Statement&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WeWork announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it filed confidentially in late December to go public, becoming the latest hot start-up to consider heading to the stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Should the company follow through on its plans, its initial public offering would be among the most eagerly anticipated in recent years. It was valued at $47 billion in an investment this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company helped take the idea of co-working — where it leases out commercial real estate, redesigns it for shared office space and sells memberships — to a new level of popularity. The business model gained cachet with trendy décor and, in many locations, beer and coffee on tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But those ambitions have come at a steep cost. The company’s revenue doubled last year, to $1.8 billion. But its losses more than doubled, to $1.9 billion — and show no signs of reversing anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In its public announcement, WeWork said it filed a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 28. That was after SoftBank, the Japanese technology conglomerate and one of the company’s biggest investors, opted not to buy a controlling stake in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We have regularly focused on how to take our business to the next level in every aspect,” Adam Neumann, WeWork’s chief executive, wrote in a memorandum sent to employees on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In his memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Neumann said that an amended document was filed with regulators last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Many of the biggest so-called decacorns, or privately held companies with valuations of at least $10 billion, have filed to go public in the past several months. Among them are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/technology/lyft-ipo.html?dlbk=&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;, the ride-hailing company, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/technology/pinterest-ipo-stock.html?dlbk=&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;, the digital pin board. The biggest of them all, Uber, is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/technology/uber-amazon-roadshow-ipo.html?dlbk=&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;expected to begin trading&lt;/a&gt; on the New York Stock Exchange in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But within that cohort of I.P.O. candidates, WeWork stands out for its combination of highflying ambitions and unsettled financial outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It has become one of the biggest corporate landlords in the world, with about 401,000 memberships spread out across 425 locations as of Dec. 31. Nearly two years ago, it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/business/lord-taylor-wework.html?dlbk=&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;bought the longtime Manhattan flagship of Lord &amp;amp; Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, the department store chain, to become its own global headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But it has sought to add more and more services, some of which appear only tenuously related to corporate life. Technically, its parent company is the We Company, whose stated mission is “to elevate the world’s consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/business/dealbook/wework-meetup.html?dlbk=&amp;amp;module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;It bought Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, the service for bringing together aficionados of common interests like learning Dutch or knitting, in 2017. It opened a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://wegrow.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;private school in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;. And it &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-takes-a-dip-in-the-wave-pool-business-1510765780?dlbk&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;invested in a wave-pool company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That vision has won the company billions of dollars in funding from deep-pocketed investors. Chief among them is SoftBank, which has bet heavily on what it considers world-changing enterprises. Even after it decided not to buy the company, it put $2 billion into the business — bringing its total investment in WeWork to $10.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WeWork executives defend their approach, arguing that they are seizing an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We’re looking at building this business out, not just maximizing profitability over the next one to two years,” Michael Gross, the company’s vice chairman, said in an interview last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It is the same argument that Uber, Lyft and others in this generation of technology darlings have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Investors in the public markets have appeared skeptical of companies that emphasize empire-building over breaking even for many years. Shares in Lyft were down 16 percent from their I.P.O. price as of Monday’s market close, while those in the social media company Snap are down 34 percent from their debut price two years on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;And while WeWork has argued that it is in a strong financial position, with $6.6 billion in cash and committee capital as of last year, critics worry that it could suffer if the economy worsens. Among the chief concerns is the company being trapped in long-term leases with a drop-off in subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Artie Minson, WeWork’s president, said last month that WeWork could become profitable if it decided to take the foot off the growth acceleration pedal. If investors, either on the private or public markets, stop pumping the company full of cash, it may need to pump those brakes sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;WeWork has also adopted some unusual financial measures to make the losses appear less severe. One is known as “community-adjusted Ebitda,” which excludes a host of costs like stock-based compensation and marketing. By that measure, the company earned $467.1 million last year, double what it earned in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though the company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it could still decide not to go public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Even so, WeWork has begun asking investment banks to prepare pitches for underwriting roles for an I.P.O., according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. A spokesman for WeWork declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5815&quot; id=&quot;5815&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For the longest time Jenkins has, in my opinion, really been the only game in town when it came to Continuous Integration (CI) and even to some extent Continuous Deployment (CD). However, after several years of using, and fighting Jenkins I think it may be time to move on. Like so many other programs Jenkins has become a victim of its own success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*LOFbTP2SxXcFpM_qTsUSuw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;800&quot; data-height=&quot;800&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*LOFbTP2SxXcFpM_qTsUSuw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*LOFbTP2SxXcFpM_qTsUSuw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6145&quot; id=&quot;6145&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Jenkins began life as Hudson back in 2005. It gained notoriety in 2008 as the winner of the Duke’s Choice award at Java One. When Oracle bought Sun the Open source community decided to fork a new project, Jenkins, in order to maintain it as a truly open source and free endeavor. It has continued to live on as such since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6c5f&quot; id=&quot;6c5f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve been with Jenkins through much of my career. First as a consumer of Jenkins artifacts when it was still Hudson, and now as a dev ops admin with Jenkins, creating and configuring thousands of jobs across a vast team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2219&quot; id=&quot;2219&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jenkins has grown and matured much in those years. But all is not well. I find myself fighting aspects of Jenkins on a daily basis. While some strides have been made to address some of my concerns others are intractable problems that delve to the core of how Jenkins works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;40d0&quot; id=&quot;40d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Build Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eac0&quot; id=&quot;eac0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Jenkins' core components are Jobs. These are the build configurations that tell Jenkins what and how to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;4c11&quot; id=&quot;4c11&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Web UI&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a9aa&quot; id=&quot;a9aa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;At first everything was done through the UI. All projects were configured through very easy to use web forms. This was great, at first. But it soon became apparent that this was difficult to backup, and maintain. Also with the growing desire for configuration as code this didn’t fit well. Configuring large numbers of jobs was tedious and error prone. Maintaining those configurations was even harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;b315&quot; id=&quot;b315&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Job DSL&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;293e&quot; id=&quot;293e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Next came &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenkins Job DSL&lt;/a&gt;. This was a welcome step towards configuration driven development. Jenkins Job DSL allowed you to use Groovy to &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; your jobs. You could create reusable classes and methods to generate 10's, 100’s, 1000’s of jobs with little work as an admin. As an added benefit we could also source control the job configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;cc00&quot; id=&quot;cc00&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
def gitUrl = 'git://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin.git'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;b1b3&quot; id=&quot;b1b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
job('PROJ-unit-tests') {&lt;br/&gt;scm {&lt;br/&gt;git(gitUrl)&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;triggers {&lt;br/&gt;scm('*/15 * * * *')&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;steps {&lt;br/&gt;maven('-e clean test')&lt;br/&gt;maven('-B release:prepare release:perform')&lt;br/&gt;shell('cleanup.sh')&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a1b9&quot; id=&quot;a1b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;But all was not well. Job DSL had (has) several key flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d331&quot; id=&quot;d331&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It wasn’t always easy to start from scratch. The seed job pattern was difficult to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe0e&quot; id=&quot;fe0e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Testing of build scripts was nearly impossible. This led sys admins to testing configuration in production. Also experimenting on new features was very difficult to do. What if you wanted one branch to build differently than other branches? You could do this but it wasn’t very clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6bc4&quot; id=&quot;6bc4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While the Job DSL was centrally maintained, which the SA’s loved, it left the developers feeling like second class citizens when it came to configuring the jobs. Not all Jobs fell into the exact same pattern. This often led to very complex DSL scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;a851&quot; id=&quot;a851&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jenkins Pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bab1&quot; id=&quot;bab1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Recently the move has been to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenkins Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; or as many refer to them as Jenkinsfile, since the build is driven off a special file in the repository of the name Jenkinsfile. Jenkinsfile puts the control back in the developers hands. The build configuration is stored with the code. This allows for different branches to behave differently depending on the Jenkinsfile configuration in that branch. SA’s can still maintain a set of core functionality that the developers can import into their scripts and customize as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;a2d0&quot; id=&quot;a2d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
pipeline {&lt;br/&gt;agent any &lt;br/&gt;stages {&lt;br/&gt;stage('Build') { &lt;br/&gt;steps {&lt;br/&gt;// &lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;stage('Test') { &lt;br/&gt;steps {&lt;br/&gt;// &lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;stage('Deploy') { &lt;br/&gt;steps {&lt;br/&gt;// &lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;afbb&quot; id=&quot;afbb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;While this does provide the ability to experiment in a more isolated environment it still has several problems. Although, Jenkinsfile is technically groovy you can’t do many groovy things you would normally think you could do because of the tight security concerns. Often this would show up as weird errors like not being able to do a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;for each&lt;/em&gt; on a list. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been coding in Jenkinsfile just to have something seemingly benign blow up due to security script permissions. This then requires someone to login to Jenkins, approve the call, and run the job again. Rinse and repeat until hopefully the job completes. On top of all those, the whitelist can’t be configured and stored externally. Therefore, when you start a new Jenkins instance with your library you have to go through approving all those same scripts all of again. And you can’t approve a script until after it fails. So, good luck making sure everything is correctly approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;661e&quot; id=&quot;661e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jenkinsfile is split into stages. This allows for nice isolation of build ideas like building, testing, releasing etc. Previous versions of Jenkins didn’t allow resuming the pipeline. I am happy to report the this seems to have been resolved in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-45455&quot; data-href=&quot;https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-45455&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;April 2018 release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;794d&quot; id=&quot;794d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Plugins&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;733c&quot; id=&quot;733c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;On its own the core of Jenkins is fairly small. But no one runs Jenkins this way. You need, and want, plugins. Plugins are awesome! They allow third parties to write new functionality into Jenkins. We get pages with all kinds of content merged together. For example, I can have a build that displays code coverage, units test history, static code analysis trends and more. Wonderful right. On the surface yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f182&quot; id=&quot;f182&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But plugins have a dark side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3ad7&quot; id=&quot;3ad7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because of plugins, and plugin versions, maintaining Jenkins is a nightmare. Plugin’s are deployed INTO Jenkins. As part of the single Jenkins Master web container. This means they all share a common classpath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;db50&quot; id=&quot;db50&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How do I know if I’m going to break something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4aed&quot; id=&quot;4aed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A lot of times upgrading Jenkins also changes the underlying configuration files. If you use Jenkins Job DSL then you must ensure it stays in sync with your version of Jenkins AND all the installed plugins. This forces you to have multiple Jenkins instances. But you can’t easily do traditional canary deployment patterns with Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d430&quot; id=&quot;d430&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This ends up stagnating new features and delaying upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;a8c0&quot; id=&quot;a8c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;File Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;23ca&quot; id=&quot;23ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;All the data that Jenkins generates and uses to render all those lovely build result pages is stored as files. Lots, and lots and lots of files. This makes Jenkins performance incredibly IO bound. It is not unusual for large pipeline views to take several seconds to render. These large files also make Jenkins very memory intensive. Lots of times Jenkins parses these files as entire DOM’s, loading the whole contents of the file into memory. It is not unusually for Jenkins to use several Gigabytes of heap size. In fact, our production Jenkins instance has a 32 GB heap just to keep things running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;53af&quot; id=&quot;53af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Memory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba80&quot; id=&quot;ba80&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Speaking of memory because all the plugins are actually code that is loaded into Jenkins it is quite common to see large memory leaks. This isn’t the core Jenkins’ fault but it will still take down the server. We now schedule regular restarts of our Jenkins instance to alleviate the memory leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;bc3a&quot; id=&quot;bc3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;System Groovy Scripts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;afc0&quot; id=&quot;afc0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;If you are every tempted to use System Groovy scripts, DON’T! You can (will) mess up Jenkins all to easily. This is because the script is not a forked process, instead the script runs IN Jenkins. This is on purpose since as a system groovy script you want access to Jenkins itself and the actual running classes. But that means you also have access to the direct JVM and process that is running Jenkins. Therefore, you can mess with the class path, the heap, and even take the whole thing down (System.exit?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;0728&quot; id=&quot;0728&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jenkins Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6068&quot; id=&quot;6068&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;While Job DSL and Jenkins file help in the configuration of Jobs they do very little when it comes to configuring Jenkins itself. You WILL need to configure Jenkins to connect to your static slaves or Mesos clusters, or setting up security or configuration environment variables, build tools etc. Job DSL has some libraries you can use to do this but they are hard to understand and impossible to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;a1ef&quot; id=&quot;a1ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Impossible To Test&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9e7f&quot; id=&quot;9e7f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I’ve said this once, twice, a thousands times. Jenkins is IMPOSSIBLE to test. Who would use a programming language that you couldn’t test except for in production. No one! Some of you may be saying of course you can test Jenkins. Believe me I’ve tried. How do you truly test it? We’ve tried starting up local instance of Jenkins, but this quickly breaks down when it comes to actually running the builds. What about the actual configuration? You need to configure access to the cluster, mock critical infrastructure like artifactory and DTR. It’s just really hard. And on top of all that you want your tests to not effect the actual system. Several times our “tests” have caused production issues due to the lack of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;dd77&quot; id=&quot;dd77&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Upgrades&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f5e9&quot; id=&quot;f5e9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I mentioned this briefly in plugins but upgrades are a real problem. When you upgrade a plugin or even Jenkins itself its ALL or nothing. If you have one job that needs an older version of a plugin and another Job that wants a newer version you are stuck. You will need multiple Jenkins instances. Migrating to new versions isn’t always possible since upgrading a plugin can cause the underlying XML to change as well. Therefore, rollbacks can be nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;8d3d&quot; id=&quot;8d3d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jenkins Web UI&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;675e&quot; id=&quot;675e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The actual web UI is run on a single web container known affectionately as Jenkins Master. You can have only ONE of these. It does not support any kind of clustering or failover. So if you have a very large team of developers all hitting Jenkins the one instance needs to be very beefy and constantly monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;8ed3&quot; id=&quot;8ed3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Modularization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83bd&quot; id=&quot;83bd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The core problem to Jenkins is its a monolith. Everything lives together, the plugins, the configuration, the web ui, Jenkins core, everything in one large web application. Its time we started applying the lessons we’ve learned on our own production systems to Jenkins itself. Jenkins needs to be a cloud native modular system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;64c5&quot; id=&quot;64c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Jenkins X&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed6a&quot; id=&quot;ed6a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Jenkins X is an effort to bring Jenkins to cloud native environment of Kubernetes. Although, my experience with Jenkins X is limited I still feel it doesn’t address many of my concerns of modular disconnected components and easy testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;405e&quot; id=&quot;405e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Thankfully, there appears to be something that just might fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*WvX2qagYxANetLgTwo35_A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;868&quot; data-height=&quot;286&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*WvX2qagYxANetLgTwo35_A.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WvX2qagYxANetLgTwo35_A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7c3e&quot; id=&quot;7c3e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Drone.io&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f314&quot; id=&quot;f314&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drone.io&quot; data-href=&quot;https://drone.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drone.io&lt;/a&gt; is a CI/CD system that is based around docker containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7609&quot; id=&quot;7609&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How is this different than Jenkins on docker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8732&quot; id=&quot;8732&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Each step is a different container focused on one thing. The job configuration file wires a series of these containers together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;5ba0&quot; id=&quot;5ba0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
kind: pipeline&lt;br/&gt;name: default
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;c7c5&quot; id=&quot;c7c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
steps:&lt;br/&gt;- name: test&lt;br/&gt;image: maven:3-jdk-10&lt;br/&gt;commands:&lt;br/&gt;- mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V&lt;br/&gt;- mvn test -B
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c81a&quot; id=&quot;c81a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6f1b&quot; id=&quot;6f1b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now I can run a job on my local machine in the EXACT same environment that the build system would use. Each step is isolated in small containers that are versioned. This allows me to upgrade and add new features without effecting existing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;40b1&quot; id=&quot;40b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The same could be accomplished in Jenkinsfile. However, there is no easy local interpreter to Jenkinsfile configurations. Also, Jenkinsfile runs in Jenkins. Therefore, even if you could run the script you wouldn’t exactly replicate what Jenkins would do. With drone I could very easily interpret the configuration and run all the steps locally since all the work runs in the containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;0c30&quot; id=&quot;0c30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Build Result Meta-Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ddb1&quot; id=&quot;ddb1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;What about the artifacts and build-meta data? And all those nice web pages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cb99&quot; id=&quot;cb99&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It is the responsibility of the containers to upload any artifacts to other storage instances. Something like S3, Artifactory. These were built to handle large numbers of requests and easily distribute the load. Build meta-data should also be pushed out to other metrics services, like Casandra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;d4a1&quot; id=&quot;d4a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Build web pages?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f8c3&quot; id=&quot;f8c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Well, that does pose a problem. As of now there are no real solutions. You could create Maven sites for each build. This could display all the build results in somewhat nice formats for consumption of developers. But these would only show the results of single runs. Creating metrics and dashboard would still need to be developed externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;6b19&quot; id=&quot;6b19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1d6a&quot; id=&quot;1d6a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I see a void in the CI/CD space forming. There are several different frameworks coming out but most require you to choose a platform to run on like Google Cloud Build and &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/set-up-ci-cd-pipeline/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/set-up-ci-cd-pipeline/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Pipelines&lt;/a&gt;. Jenkins as is stands today will not work. I can only hope Jenkins X can learn from the lessons of the past and become a true modern CI/CD framework we all desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d917&quot; id=&quot;d917&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;To be clear. I like Jenkins. I continue to use Jenkins. I want to continue to use Jenkins in the future and I want it to succeed. I just feel that its current architecture needs to be updated for the cloud world. Hopefully, this will be Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>People Are Clamoring to Buy Old Insulin Pumps</title>

<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One day last June, Doug Boss pulled into a police-station parking lot to meet a stranger from Craigslist. His purpose: to buy used insulin pumps. Boss has type 1 diabetes, and he relies on a small pump attached to his body to deliver continuous doses of insulin that keep him alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To be clear, he didn’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to buy used medical equipment on Craigslist. Boss, who is 55 and works in IT in Texas, has health insurance. He even has a new, in-warranty pump sitting at home. But he was thrilled to find on Craigslist a &lt;a href=&quot;https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Gear%20Up/pump.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;coveted old model&lt;/a&gt; that was made by the medical-device company Medtronic and discontinued years ago. What makes these outdated Medtronic pumps so desirable is, ironically, a security flaw. Boss was looking for a pump or two he could hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;He’s not the only one. In 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/neodotlife/dana-lewis-open-aps-hack-artificial-pancreas-af6ef23a997f&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;a few hackers&lt;/a&gt; realized that the security flaw in certain Medtronic pumps could be exploited for a DIY revolution. Type 1 diabetes is a disease where the pancreas is unable to produce insulin to control blood sugar. For years, Boss had counted, down to the gram, the carbohydrates in every meal and told his pump how much insulin to dispense. Every cup of coffee (more insulin), every brisk walk (less insulin) turned into a math problem with serious consequences: Extremely high or low blood sugar can be fatal. The healthy pancreas does these “calculations” to adjust insulin automatically, and for decades researchers have worked toward creating an artificial pancreas that can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By 2014, the hardware components of a DIY artificial pancreas—a small insulin pump that attaches via thin disposable tubing to the body and a continuous sensor for glucose, or sugar, that slips just under the skin—were available, but it was impossible to connect the two. That’s where the security flaw came in. The hackers realized they could use it to override old Medtronic pumps with their own algorithm that automatically calculates insulin doses based on real-time glucose data. It closed the feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;They shared this code online as &lt;a href=&quot;https://openaps.org/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;OpenAPS&lt;/a&gt;, and “looping,” as it’s called, began to catch on. Instead of micromanaging their blood sugar, people with diabetes could offload that work to an algorithm. In addition to OpenAPS, another system called &lt;a href=&quot;https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;Loop&lt;/a&gt; is now available. Dozens, then hundreds, and now thousands of people are experimenting with DIY artificial-pancreas systems—none of which the Food and Drug Administration has officially approved. And they’ve had to track down discontinued Medtronic pumps. It can sometimes take months to find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Obviously, you can’t just call up Medtronic to order a discontinued pump with a security flaw. “It’s eBay, Craigslist, Facebook. It’s like this underground market for these pumps,” says Aaron Kowalski, a DIY looper and also CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdrf.org/about/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;JDRF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that funds type 1 diabetes research. This is not exactly how a market for lifesaving medical devices is supposed to work. And yet, this is the only way it can work—for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By the time Boss decided to try looping, he had not gotten a good night’s sleep in a decade. Every night, the alarm on his glucose monitor would go off when his blood sugar dipped too low or climbed too high. He’d wake up, do math with a sleep-fogged brain, and either eat a snack or give himself extra insulin. Like many patients with type 1 diabetes, he was sacrificing sleep to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;OpenAPS changed that. To start looping with OpenAPS, Boss did also need to buy a mini computer called an &lt;a href=&quot;https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Gear%20Up/edison.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;Edison&lt;/a&gt;. The Edison receives data wirelessly from his continuous glucose monitor, runs an algorithm to predict future blood sugar, and tells the insulin pump how much to dispense every five minutes to prevent highs and lows. Boss could choose to monitor everything through his phone. But at night, he simply slept. “The sheer idea that I have a chance to sleep through the night ... ” he marveled to me. So many other loopers I spoke with echoed the sentiment. Jeremy Pettus, another looper, used to keep apple juice by his bed to guard against perilously low blood sugar. “One day my wife was like, ‘We haven’t bought you apple juice in a long time,’” he says. “That burden of having a dangerous low in the middle of my night completely disappeared.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The looping algorithm makes these corrections throughout the day too. Laura Nally, another looper, described to me how she had always planned out her life hours in advance: Would she be walking a lot at work that day? Eating a meal in a couple hours? Taking a hot shower that could affect insulin absorption? “You’re always thinking, ‘What is the next thing I’m going to be doing?’” she says. With Loop, she still uses an app on her phone to tell the algorithm when she’s eating. (Same with OpenAPS, which is why both systems are technically “hybrid” closed systems rather than fully closed.) But if she is off by a few grams of carbohydrates or walks a little bit more than she expects, Loop can easily make real-time corrections. “Every decision we make, we’re trying to hit a bull’s-eye. With Loop, all I’m trying to do is get the dart on the board,” explains Erik Douds, who also uses Loop to manage his type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/image1_2/c18464e7d.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Users of Loop have to carry around an extra device called the RileyLink (in white) that translates the iPhone’s signals to the Medtronic insulin pump and vice versa. To make sure she didn’t lose it, Laura Nally decided to attach her RileyLink directly to her phone case. (Laura Nally)
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Loop and OpenAPS users tend to be a pretty self-selecting bunch, as the systems require buying your own equipment out of pocket and following detailed setup instructions. They also come with a bit of a learning curve. But according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1932296816665635&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;one small study&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1932296818795705?casa_token=EeopC1K2L8oAAAAA:YWnw0BV4YhHukE72J2oF8bRUo03ffLV4bC_ZXUNC5dSXny58WO4O0K2mljwVDtInie4ov0U_Wipc&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;many, many anecdotes&lt;/a&gt;, looping is, when done properly, both safe and better than a human brain at managing blood sugar. As the good word about looping has spread, demand for the few compatible models of Medtronic pumps has swelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Early on, loopers were often able to find old, compatible Medtronic pumps sitting unused in their own closets or a friend’s. Boss had actually gotten his first Medtronic pump from a cousin’s daughter before upgrading to a bigger version he found on Craigslist. Pettus, himself an endocrinologist, got his from a young woman who was his patient. “I have a cute little purple pump,” he says. Douds got his from a friend and looping evangelist whom he stayed with while traveling across the country. But when Nally wanted to start looping last year, she was living in the Bay Area, full of tech-savvy early adopters, and everyone she knew with a compatible Medtronic pump was already a looper. She was wary of buying one from a stranger online. Luckily, she ended up winning one of the periodic raffles for a loopable Medtronic pump in an online diabetes group. That’s how coveted the pumps have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/my-pacemaker-is-tracking-me-from-inside-my-body/551681/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/my-pacemaker-is-tracking-me-from-inside-my-body/551681/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;My pacemaker is tracking me from inside my body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;An underlying security flaw is still the reason looping is possible with Medtronic pumps. (Would-be loopers are even told &lt;a href=&quot;https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/setup/requirements/mdt-pump/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;to watch out for old pumps whose software&lt;/a&gt; has been upgraded to fix the flaw.) The security issue doesn’t bother Boss, whose day job is in IT. There’s a tiny, theoretical risk that someone who knows his pump’s serial number and gets physically close can take over. But, he says, “if I drink coffee in the morning and forget to enter it into my phone, my blood sugar is going to be higher than normal.” The everyday risk of making such a mistake outweighs the remote risk of someone else hacking his pump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A spokesperson for Medtronic wrote in a statement, “Patient safety is our first priority, and intentional device modifications can adversely impact device performance and put patient safety at risk. Medtronic strongly discourages intentional device modification of our insulin-pump systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the absence of official customer support, loopers have come to rely on one another. Rebecca Vitale told me the only reason she hasn’t quit Facebook is because she uses a group for Loop tech help. (Vitale is also friends with my partner.) From the group, she learned to cover her Medtronic pump in packing tape. The compatible Medtronic pumps, unlike newer models, are not waterproof, and their buttons are especially finicky around moisture. The packing tape keeps the pump just a bit more sweat-proof and waterproof. It’s a hack around a hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/unnamed/dfe23825c.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Like many loopers, Rebecca Vitale put packing tape on her Medtronic pump to protect it from moisture. (Rebecca Vitale)
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The looping community is so tight-knit that the person who wrote the code is sometimes the person answering questions. Hilary Koch, whose son loops, remembers spending two hours on the phone with one of the creators of OpenAPS. She tries to do her part too. “How you give back is, if you see somebody ask a question you know you can answer, you answer it,” she says. Boss also scours eBay for Edisons, which have been discontinued, and has given a few to people who want to loop, in return for a small donation to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nightscout.info/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;Nightscout&lt;/a&gt;, another open-source project used with OpenAPS to remotely access glucose data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When the creators of OpenAPS, Dana Lewis and Scott Leibrand, shared their code back in 2015, they did so for free. They weren’t in it for money, and that ethos is still very much alive in the looping community today. And so, despite all the people clamoring for loopable Medtronic pumps, attempts to sell one to the highest bidder are met with swift backlash in the online community. The going price is usually about $500. “You’ll see posts for $1,000 to $3,000—and community members are like, ‘Haha, no,’” says Lewis. (The sticker price of new Medtronic pumps runs over $7,000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Since OpenAPS first became available, looping options have slowly expanded. Another group developed Loop for iPhone, which is more user-friendly in some ways but still requires an extra piece of hardware called a RileyLink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of other new options don’t even require Medtronic pumps—but they are currently limited in other ways. &lt;a href=&quot;https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/EN/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;AndroidAPS&lt;/a&gt;, for example, runs on Accu-Chek or Dana pumps, which are approved in Europe and elsewhere, but not yet in the United States. The system also goes straight to an Android phone, eliminating the need for an extra device such as a RileyLink or an Edison. The manufacturer of Dana pumps consulted with the DIY looping community in developing its latest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/algorithms-future-of-health-care/543825/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/algorithms-future-of-health-care/543825/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;How do you regulate a self-improving algorithm?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erica Potter liked the fact that her eight-year-old daughter would not need to carry around another part with AndroidAPS. But her family lives in the U.S., where no compatible pumps are sold. Through a contact in the diabetes community, Potter managed to find a medical-supply company in North Africa that would ship a Dana pump overseas. It came out to $2,000 with supplies and shipping. The setup has worked so well that Potter has ordered a second pump for her 6-year-old, who was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. “I’m aiming for perfection because these are my kid’s organs,” she says. She is waiting for that second pump to ship right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;More recently, loopers have started testing a hacked version of another pump called Omnipod, which is available in-warranty and tubeless. (Think about the convenience of AirPods versus regular earbuds, except for something that goes under your skin.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/setup/requirements/omnipod-pump/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;Public testing&lt;/a&gt; of the Loop-Omnipod system began just last week. Kate Farnsworth, who runs a Facebook group about looping and whose own daughter loops, saw her group gain 1,000 new members in just a few days, buoyed by interest in Omnipod. “I think we’ll have a lot of new loopers,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Even with these new options, DIY looping is still on the margins of the official health-care system: It means going overseas to buy pumps not yet approved in the United States. It means testing an experimental version with Omnipod. And in most cases in the United States, it’s meant finding old, out-of-warranty Medtronic pumps. Loopers with Medtronic pumps told me they worried their decade-old devices might break, and they’d have no way to fix them. Boss has a couple of backup pumps stockpiled. Kowalski, of the nonprofit JDRF, told me he once saw his brother, who also loops, watching soldering videos on YouTube when something broke. “People are doing wacky stuff,” he says. “We don’t want wacky. We want them to use things like they normally would.” JDRF, which is a major funder of artificial-pancreas research, has been working to make the technology mainstream.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/blog/fda-approves-minimed-670g-system-worlds-first-hybrid-closed-loop-system/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;FDA approved&lt;/a&gt; a looping system from Medtronic called the Minimed 670G in 2016, after the first people started using OpenAPS. The DIY loopers I spoke with had various reasons for sticking with their DIY setup, though: It gave them more flexibility in setting their target blood sugar. It allowed them to use their preferred glucose monitor rather than Medtronic’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A nonprofit called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tidepool.org/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;Tidepool&lt;/a&gt; is now collaborating on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03838900&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'None'&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to get Loop &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tidepool.org/blog/tidepool-delivering-loop&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'None'&quot;&gt;approved by the FDA&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s also partnered with the company behind Omnipod to make the next version of its pods officially Loop-compatible—a more formalized version of the DIY Loop-Omnipod system that hackers just made available for public testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;JDRF, which is a funder of Tidepool, has put forth a vision of a “plug and play” artificial pancreas. Currently, Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G locks the patient into a Medtronic pump, a Medtronic glucose sensor, and Medtronic software. The idea, says Kowalski, is to have multiple compatible pumps, glucose sensors, and algorithms, so that patients can mix and match what they prefer. Looping, in whatever form, is almost certainly the future for type 1 diabetes. It might be all that kids today ever know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Koch’s son is almost 13 now, old enough to start learning how to manage diabetes on his own. She reflected on the years of interrupted sleep, of weighing the carbs in every meal he brought to school, of ticking off minutes for his blood sugar to drop before he could eat a snack. He’s been looping for more than two years now, and some of those memories are starting to fade. “He will never know it like we did,” she says. “And I think that’s a wonderful thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Written in Rust&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;span&gt;We chose to write stretch in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust programming language&lt;/a&gt; as it ensures memory safety, efficient multi-threading, and has fantastic cross-platform support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimised for mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;span&gt;While stretch can be used on any platform we chose to optimize it for mobile. This means a small binary size and minimal memory usage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tested against Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Stretch is tested against Chrome to ensure 100% web compatibility. You can trust stretch to layout your native apps exactly like your web apps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Let’s talk about Layout. Layout is fundamental to any UI application. The layout engine is what takes a set of rules and figures out where to place elements on the screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;pA7L7h&quot;&gt;Burger King is rolling out the Impossible Whopper nationwide, after a successful trial run testing the meatless burger in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290336/burger-king-impossible-burger-st-louis-meat-free-meatless&quot;&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;. The chain announced in a statement today that it plans to test in more markets before distributing the burger nationally by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SUw7JE&quot;&gt;The Impossible Whopper is made with startup Impossible Foods’ plant-based patties, which are designed to look and taste like meat. The patties are also designed to “bleed,” just like the real thing, which can be attributed to the use of heme, a soy-based compound found in plants and meat. The burgers have 15 percent less fat and 90 percent less cholesterol than regular Whoppers, and Burger King’s taste test experiments claim that customers and employees can’t tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6nDzR8&quot;&gt;Meatless options are gaining popularity at more fast food restaurants. White Castle offers Impossible Burgers, which uses another meat-free patty recipe from Impossible Foods, and Carl’s Jr. sells a veggie burger made by Beyond Meat, a competitor to Impossible Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
