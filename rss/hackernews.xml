<title>US Customs Database Of Traveler Photos Was Stolen In A Data Breach</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/the-us-governments-database-of-traveler-photos-has-been</link>

<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;63.973891924712&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subcontractor with the US Customs and Border Protection agency has suffered a data breach that has exposed the photos of travelers traveling in and out of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Monday statement, the agency said that a copy of its database of traveler photos and license plate images had been &quot;compromised by a malicious cyber-attack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database of identifying photos had been transferred to a CBP subcontractor's company network without the US agency's authorization or knowledge, CBP explained. The subcontractor's network was then hacked, though CBP said its own systems had not been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traveler images were raw images only, not tied to any additional personally identifiable information, according to a law enforcement official. The images were restricted to land border entries and did not include any passport or visa photos, the official added. Congressional lawmakers and staffers were notified of the breach on Saturday. Less than 100,000 people had their information compromised, according to the official.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyberattack comes amid the ongoing rollout of CBP's “biometric entry-exit system,” the government initiative to biometrically verify the identities of all travelers crossing US borders. As BuzzFeed News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/these-documents-reveal-the-governments-detailed-plan-for&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, CBP is scrambling to implement the initiative with the goal of using facial recognition technology on “100 percent of all international passengers,” including American citizens, in the top 20 US airports by 2021. And it is doing so in the absence of proper vetting, regulatory safeguards, and what privacy advocates say is in defiance of the law, BuzzFeed News found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;90.952720022786&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/23/perceptics_hacked_license_plate_recognition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Register reported&lt;/a&gt; that Perceptics, the maker of vehicle license plate readers used by the US government and cities to identify and track citizens, was hacked, and its files were dumped online. CBP did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News asking whether the breach the US agency announced today and the Perceptics hack are related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perceptics did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This breach comes just as CBP seeks to expand its massive face recognition apparatus and collection of sensitive information from travelers, including license plate information and social media identifiers,&quot; Neema Singh Guliani, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. &quot;This incident further underscores the need to put the brakes on these efforts and for Congress to investigate the agency’s data practices. The best way to avoid breaches of sensitive personal data is not to collect and retain such data in the first place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One very good reason that databases that are law enforcement– and privacy-sensitive, as this one is, should be wholly governmental and not subject to contractors or subcontractors,” said Theresa Brown, a former CBP adviser who now heads immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “There should never have been the ability to download a database like this off of government servers.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its announcement Monday, CBP did not mention the name of the subcontractor, how many people have been affected by the breach, and whether the breach affected primarily US citizens or noncitizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he would hold hearings on how DHS uses biometric information next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Government use of biometric and personal identifiable information can be valuable tools only if utilized properly. Unfortunately, this is the second major privacy breach at DHS this year,&quot; he said. &quot;We must ensure we are not expanding the use of biometrics at the expense of the privacy of the American public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read CBP's full statement below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection Statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unauthorized Access of CBP Data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 10, 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 31, 2019, CBP learned that a subcontractor, in violation of CBP policies and without CBP’s authorization or knowledge, had transferred copies of license plate images and traveler images collected by CBP to the subcontractor’s company network. The subcontractor’s network was subsequently compromised by a malicious cyber-attack. No CBP systems were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial information indicates that the subcontractor violated mandatory security and privacy protocols outlined in their contract. As of today, none of the image data has been identified on the Dark Web or internet. CBP has alerted Members of Congress and is working closely with other law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity entities, and its own Office of Professional Responsibility to actively investigate the incident. CBP will unwaveringly work with all partners to determine the extent of the breach and the appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBP has removed from service all equipment related to the breach and is closely monitoring all CBP work by the subcontractor. CBP requires that all contractors and service providers maintain appropriate data integrity and cybersecurity controls and follow all incident response notification and remediation procedures. CBP takes its privacy and cybersecurity responsibilities very seriously and demands all contractors to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>GrapheneOS – A privacy and security-focused mobile OS with Android compatibility</title>
<link>https://grapheneos.org/#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://grapheneos.org/#</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS is an open source privacy and security focused mobile OS with Android app compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official Releases are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://grapheneos.org/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; and installation instructions are on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://grapheneos.org/install&quot;&gt;install page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GrapheneOS&quot;&gt;GitHub organization&lt;/a&gt; for sources of the OS and various standalone sub-projects including the cutting edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;new hardened memory allocator&lt;/a&gt; and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official GrapheneOS releases are supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases&quot;&gt;Auditor app&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://attestation.app/&quot;&gt;attestation service&lt;/a&gt; for hardware-based attestation. For more details, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attestation.app/about&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://attestation.app/tutorial&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. You can also extend these with support for your own builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources are available via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest&quot;&gt;manifest on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS is a privacy / security research and engineering project that has been under way for over 5 years. It recently became rebranded as GrapheneOS and is taking a different direction based on obtaining funding for the research and development work as a non-profit open source project rather than being a company. The reborn project is still in a very early stage and lots of the past work on privacy and security has not yet been restored for the new incarnation of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grapheneos.org site is very new and is currently being put together. It will have lots of additional documentation and tutorials in the future along with coverage of various software, firmware and hardware privacy/security topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GrapheneOS is being supported with funding and developers from various companies and other organizations interested in contributing to this shared base for a feature rich private and secure mobile operating system able to run many existing applications. It will take more time to organize and deploy these resources in order for the project to have a strong development team with proper infrastructure behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details on the roadmap of the project will be posted on the site in the near future. In the long term, it aims to move beyond a hardened fork of the Android Open Source Project. Achieving the goals requires moving away from relying the Linux kernel as the core of the OS and foundation of the security model. It needs to move towards a microkernel-based model with a Linux compatibility layer, with many stepping stones leading towards that goal including adopting virtualization-based isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware and firmware security are core parts of the project, but it's currently limited to research and submitting suggestions and bug reports upstream. In the long term, the project will need to move into the hardware space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current early stage of the project, GrapheneOS provides production releases for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. It will support other devices in the future, but devices are carefully chosen based on their merits rather than the project aiming to have broad device support. Broad device support is counter to the aims of the project, and the project will eventually be engaging in hardware and firmware level improvements rather than only offering suggestions and bug reports upstream for those areas. Much of the work on the project involves changes that are specific to different devices, and officially supported devices are the ones targeted by most of this ongoing work. GrapheneOS also has source level support without device-specific hardening for the Android emulator, HiKey, HiKey 960 and also generic targets providing basic support for many other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devices need to be meet the standards of the project in order to be considered as potential targets. In addition to support for installing other operating systems, standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available. Devices with support for alternative operating systems as an afterthought will not be considered. Devices need to have proper ongoing support for their firmware and software specific to the hardware like drivers in order to provide proper full security updates too. Devices that are end-of-life and no longer receiving these updates will not be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to support a device, the appropriate resources also need to be available and dedicated towards it. Releases for each supported device need to be robust and stable, with all standard functionality working properly and testing for each of the releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware, firmware and software specific to devices like drivers play a huge role in the overall security of a device. The goal of the project is not to slightly improve some aspects of insecure devices and supporting a broad set of devices would be directly counter to the values of the project. A lot of the low-level work also ends up being fairly tied to the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the GrapheneOS sub-projects support other operating systems on a broader range of devices. Device support for Auditor and AttestationServer is documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attestation.app/about&quot;&gt;overview of those projects&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GrapheneOS&quot;&gt;hardened_malloc&lt;/a&gt; project supports nearly any Linux-based environment due to official support for musl, glibc and Bionic along with easily added support for other environments. It can easily run on non-Linux-based operating systems too, and supporting some like HardenedBSD is planned but depends on contributors from those communities.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New Radiotracer Can Identify Nearly 30 Types of Cancer</title>
<link>https://www.snmmi.org/NewsPublications/NewsDetail.aspx?ItemNumber=31744</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;June 7, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Potential for Therapeutic Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reston, VA—&lt;/strong&gt;A novel class of radiopharmaceuticals has proven effective in non-invasively identifying nearly 30 types of malignant tumors, according to research published in the June issue of &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Using &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), researchers were able to image a wide variety of tumors with very high uptake and image contrast, paving the way for new applications in tumor characterization, staging and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI radiotracer targets cancer-associated fibroblasts, which can contribute up to 90 percent of a tumor’s mass. Many cancer-associated fibroblasts differ from normal fibroblasts by their specific expression of the fibroblast activation protein, or FAP. FAP-specific inhibitors were first developed as conventional anticancer drugs; now they have been advanced into tumor-targeting radiopharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the retrospective study, researchers used PET/CT to image 80 patients with 28 different kinds of cancer, aiming to quantify &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI uptake in primary, metastatic or recurring cancers. All patients were referred for experimental diagnostics by their treating oncologists because they were facing an unmet diagnostic challenge that could not be solved sufficiently with standard methods. The injected activity for the &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI examinations was 122-312 MBq, and the PET scans were initiated one hour after injection. Tumor tracer uptake was measured by SUV&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; and SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All patients tolerated the examination well. As the overall SUV mean, median and range of &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI in primary tumors and metastatic lesions did not differ significantly, researchers analyzed all results in one group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest average SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;12) was found in sarcoma, esophageal, breast, cholangiocarcinoma and lung cancer. The lowest &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI uptake (average SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;6) was observed in pheochromocytoma, renal cell, differentiated thyroid, adenoid cystic and gastric cancers. The average SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of hepatocellular, colorectal, head-neck, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer was intermediate (SUV&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; 6-12). In addition, the tumor-to-background ratios were more than three-fold in the intermediate group and more than six-fold in the high-intensity uptake group, resulting in high image contrast and excellent tumor delineation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The remarkably high uptake of &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI makes it useful for many cancer types, especially in cases where traditional &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT faces limitations,” said Uwe Haberkorn, MD, professor of nuclear medicine at the University Hospital of Heidelberg and the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. “For example, low-grade sarcomas generally have a low uptake of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG, causing an overlap between benign and malignant lesions. In breast cancer, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT is commonly used in recurrence, but not generally recommended for initial staging. And for esophageal cancer, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT often has only a low to moderate sensitivity for lymph node staging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG PET/CT, &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI PET/CT can be performed without specific patient preparation such as fasting or recline during uptake time. This is a potential operational advantage for &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI PET/CT, as it stands to improve patient comfort and accelerate work-flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Haberkorn, &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI offers the possibility of a theranostic approach in the future. “Cancer associated fibroblasts have been described as immunosuppressive and as conferring resistance to chemotherapy, which makes them attractive targets for combination therapies,” he said. “Because the &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Ga-FAPI tracers contain the universal DOTA-chelator, it is possible to label them with therapeutic radionuclides whose half-life fits to the tumor retention time of the carrier molecule. Since the tracer has been observed to accumulate in several important tumor entities, there may be a huge field of therapeutic application to be evaluated in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, it wasn't that long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were sub-groups and communities. The weirdos found each other. The non-weirdos found each other. It wasn't perfect. But it was distributed. It was ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now? The original dream of the web is dying. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Medium, and YouTube entice us to give them our creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They control what gets amplified and what gets monetized. A few conference rooms in Silicon Valley dictate our online culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop giving away your work to people who don't care about it. Host it yourself. Distribute it via methods you control. Build your audience deliberately and on your own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be in charge of the relationship with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliver value and then ask for money. Avoid unnecessary middlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see someone in the wild, not owning their platform? Let them know:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Salesforce is buying Tableau for $15.7B</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;On the heels of &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; buying &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/google-to-acquire-analytics-startup-looker-for-2-6-billion/&quot;&gt;analytics startup Looker last week for $2.6 billion&lt;/a&gt;, Salesforce today announced a huge piece of news in a bid to step up its own work in data visualization and (more generally) tools to help enterprises make sense of the sea of data that they use and amass: &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Tableau/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Salesforce is buying Tableau for $15.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; in an all-stock deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter is publicly traded and this deal will involve shares of &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/tableau&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;tableau&quot;&gt;Tableau&lt;/a&gt; Class A and Class B common stock getting exchanged for 1.103 shares of &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;salesforce&quot;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt; common stock, the company said, and so the $15.7 billion figure is the enterprise value of the transaction, based on the average price of Salesforce’s shares as of June 7, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge jump on Tableau’s last market cap: it was valued at $10.79 billion at close of trading Friday, according to figures on Google Finance. (Also: trading has halted on its stock in light of this news.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two boards have already approved the deal, Salesforce notes. The two companies’ management teams will be hosting a conference call at 8am Eastern and I’ll listen in to that as well to get more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge deal for Salesforce as it continues to diversify beyond CRM software and into deeper layers of analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reportedly worked hard to — but ultimately missed out on — buying LinkedIn (which &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; picked up instead), and while there isn’t a whole lot in common between LinkedIn and Tableau, this deal will also help Salesforce extend its engagement (and data intelligence) for the customers that Salesforce already has — something that LinkedIn would have also helped it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also looks like a move designed to help bulk up against Google’s move to buy &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/looker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;looker&quot;&gt;Looker,&lt;/a&gt; announced last week, although I’d argue that analytics is a big enough area that all major tech companies that are courting enterprises are getting their ducks in a row in terms of squaring up to stronger strategies (and products) in this area. It’s unclear whether (and if) the two deals were made in response to each other, although it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/technology/leaked-document-listed-tableau-among-salesforces-potential-acquisition-targets/&quot;&gt;Salesforce has been eyeing up Tableau for years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are bringing together the world’s #1 CRM with the #1 analytics platform. Tableau helps people see and understand data, and Salesforce helps people engage and understand customers. It’s truly the best of both worlds for our customers–bringing together two critical platforms that every customer needs to understand their world,” said &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/marc-benioff&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;marc-benioff&quot;&gt;Marc Benioff,&lt;/a&gt; chairman and co-CEO, Salesforce, in a statement. “I’m thrilled to welcome Adam and his team to Salesforce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tableau has about 86,000 business customers, including Charles Schwab, Verizon (which owns TC), Schneider Electric, Southwest and Netflix. Salesforce said Tableau will operate independently and under its own brand post-acquisition. It will also remain headquartered in Seattle, Wash., headed by CEO Adam Selipsky along with others on the current leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, later during the call, Benioff let it drop that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-officially-making-seattle-its-second-headquarters-with-its-tableau-acquisition/&quot;&gt;Seattle would become Salesforce’s official second headquarters&lt;/a&gt; with the closing of this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say, though, that the two will not be working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, Salesforce is already talking up the possibilities of expanding what the company is already doing with its &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/einstein&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;einstein&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; platform (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/18/salesforce-turns-its-attention-to-artificial-intelligence-with-salesforce-einstein/&quot;&gt;launched back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Einstein is the home of all of Salesforce’s AI-based initiatives); and with “Customer 360,” which is the company’s product and take on omnichannel sales and marketing. The latter is an obvious and complementary product home, given that one huge aspect of Tableau’s service is to provide “big picture” insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Joining forces with Salesforce will enhance our ability to help people everywhere see and understand data,” said Selipsky. “As part of the world’s #1 CRM company, Tableau’s intuitive and powerful analytics will enable millions more people to discover actionable insights across their entire organizations. I’m delighted that our companies share very similar cultures and a relentless focus on customer success. I look forward to working together in support of our customers and communities.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Salesforce’s incredible success has always been based on anticipating the needs of our customers and providing them the solutions they need to grow their businesses,” said Keith Block, co-CEO, Salesforce. “Data is the foundation of every digital transformation, and the addition of Tableau will accelerate our ability to deliver customer success by enabling a truly unified and powerful view across all of a customer’s data.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla will reportedly launch a paid version of Firefox this fall</title>
<link>https://thenextweb.com/apps/2019/06/10/mozilla-will-reportedly-launch-a-paid-version-of-firefox-this-fall/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thenextweb.com/apps/2019/06/10/mozilla-will-reportedly-launch-a-paid-version-of-firefox-this-fall/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla’s reportedly set to launch a premium version of its revered Firefox browser this fall. In an interview with German media outlet &lt;a href=&quot;https://t3n.de/news/mozilla-ceo-chris-beard-anbieten-1168614/3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;T3N&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO, Chris Beard, said that it’s aiming to launch the new version by October, with features like a VPN and secure cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s already experimented with a VPN service by &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com/blog/mozilla-partnership/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;partnering up with ProtonVPN&lt;/a&gt; and offering a $10 subscription. Now, the company’s thinking of offering some amount of free VPN bandwidth to get you started, and then charge a premium for metered access in the form of a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Beard specified that there’s no plan to charge users for current features that are free:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what we want to clarify is that there is no plan to charge money for things that are now free. So we will roll out a subscription service and offer a premium level. And the plan is to introduce the first one this year, towards fall. We aim for October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no word on pricing just as of now, but a privacy-focused premium version of Firefox sounds like an enticing offering, at a time when it’s hard to avoid being tracked on your digital devices, and when data leaks are rife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve contacted Mozilla to learn more, and will update this post when there’s a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;post-article-read-next&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read next:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-article-read-next&quot; data-event-category=&quot;Article&quot; data-event-action=&quot;Next post&quot; data-event-label=&quot;&quot; data-event-non-interaction=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/podium/2019/06/10/the-splinternet-is-here-and-your-company-needs-to-be-ready/&quot;&gt;The Splinternet is here and your company needs to be ready&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Android now forces apps to include proprietary code for push notifications</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/freesoftware/comments/by4ipr/android_now_forces_apps_to_include_proprietary/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/freesoftware/comments/by4ipr/android_now_forces_apps_to_include_proprietary/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;rz6fp9-10 himKiy&quot;&gt;FOSS messaging apps such as &lt;a class=&quot;rz6fp9-27 glEMdW&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Telegram-FOSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;rz6fp9-27 glEMdW&quot; href=&quot;https://riot.im/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;riot.im&lt;/a&gt;, and other free software apps that need push notifications, are facing a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rz6fp9-10 himKiy&quot;&gt;Google started leveraging its de-facto monopoly on Android distributions by forcing all apps to use its proprietary service Firebase for push notifications. Problem: The Firebase Android client library is &lt;a class=&quot;rz6fp9-27 glEMdW&quot; href=&quot;https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.firebase/firebase-client-android&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proprietary&lt;/a&gt;, meaning FOSS apps can not use it. Apps that do not comply are reported to the user as &quot;using too much battery&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rz6fp9-10 himKiy&quot;&gt;The Telegram-FOSS team writes &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;rz6fp9-27 glEMdW&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Telegram-FOSS-Team/Telegram-FOSS/blob/master/Notifications.md&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Despite Google's misleading warnings, there is no difference in battery usage [...]&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. The warning is sure to frighten most users, though, effectively making Android a less open platform.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Screenshots from developers and Unix people taken in 2002 (2015)</title>
<link>https://anders.unix.se/2015/10/28/screenshots-from-developers--unix-people-2002/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://anders.unix.se/2015/10/28/screenshots-from-developers--unix-people-2002/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised 2015-10-29: Found a few more (John Baldwin, Rob Malda, itojun).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/2015/12/10/screenshots-from-developers--2002-vs.-2015/&quot;&gt;the 2015 follow-up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More from the vaults: In 2002, for Unix.se, I asked a number of developers/Unix people for screenshots of their desktops. Sort of like a crude &lt;a href=&quot;https://usesthis.com/&quot;&gt;usesthis.com&lt;/a&gt;-style thing. Here’s what I received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie&quot;&gt;Dennis Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; (creator of C, co-creator of Unix):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/dmr_screenshot.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/dmr_screenshot.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dennis Ritchie's desktop, July 2002
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached is a (truthful) screenshot from when I read your mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying OS is WNT 4, as might be guessed from the desktop display on the left. Almost all the space is taken up by a super-window running the drawterm program, an (approximate) analog of X server that’s connected to a Plan 9 CPU server (over ISDN; the server is at the main Bell Labs location, and I’m at home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest (pale yellow) window is a Plan 9 application called acme, which includes a mail utility showing your message. Smaller subwindows within the drawterm display are the mail-notifier program, and a shell window whose latest output is from our dictionary utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan&quot;&gt;Brian Kernighan&lt;/a&gt; (Unix legend, the K in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language&quot;&gt;K&amp;amp;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK&quot;&gt;AWK&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/bwk_desktop.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/bwk_desktop.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Brian Kernighan's desktop, July 2002
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my desktop is pretty boring, since it consists of xterm windows to whatever unix system i am using at the moment. the machine itself is likely to be running some x-window server like exceed on some flavor of windows, though for many years i just used an x terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;, July 2002:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how to make a screenshot, because I normally use my computer in text-mode. I have X and GNOME installed, but I use them only occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar&quot;&gt;Bram Moolenaar&lt;/a&gt; (author of Vim):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_b_moolenaar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_b_moolenaar.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bram Moolenaar's desktop, September 2002
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my desktop is quite boring. I mostly work with four xterms and a few Netscape windows. The KDE bar hides automatically, you can only see a thin grey line at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf&quot;&gt;Rasmus Lerdorf&lt;/a&gt; (creator of PHP):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_rasmus_lerdorf.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_rasmus_lerdorf.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rasmus Lerdorf's desktop, September 2002
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux (2.4.20-pre5), Gnome2, vim, Pine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ettrich&quot;&gt;Matthias Ettrich&lt;/a&gt; (founder of the KDE and LyX projects):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_matthias_ettrich.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_matthias_ettrich.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Matthias Ettrich's desktop, September 2002
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I’m running S.u.S.E. 8.0 with latest KDE compiled from CVS. My environment was pretty typically when your email reached me, basically a konsole with a bunch of virtual terminal sessions opens (you can switch betweem them with hotkeys), and a XEmacs (notice the proportional fonts, I can’t live without them) that has most of Qt loaded into its buffers. In the background you see the monitoring GUI for our compile farm, at the moment of the screenshot 25 machines were connected. On the other desktops I have a couple of konqueror windows open, a kmail and in the system tray a kscd, which currently plays Mozart’s piano Sonata No. 15 in F by Christian Zacharias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://minnie.tuhs.org/warren.html&quot;&gt;Warren Toomey&lt;/a&gt; (Unix historian):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_warren_toomey.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://anders.unix.se/images/desktop_warren_toomey.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Warren Toomey's desktop, August 2002
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, my desktop is pretty boring, I used fvwm 1.24 as my window manager and I try to have no more than 1 or 2 windows open per virtual desktop. I use FreeBSD 4-STABLE as my operating system. I first came across Unix when I got an account on a Pyramid 90x running OSx. This had a dual-universe setup: both AT&amp;amp;T and BSD-style environments, chosen by an environment variable. Initially I was given the AT&amp;amp;T environment, but my friends convinced me to ``come over” to BSD. Since then I’ve been a BSD afficionado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After OSx, SunOS 3.5 and later SunOS releases, until 386BSD 0.1 came out and I started to run BSD at home. Then when 386BSD transmogrified to FreeBSD, I went with FreeBSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of desktop, I’m a command-line guy, always will be. My favourite editor is vi, my favourite shell is tcsh (but kudos to rc for elegance). So I don’t really feel the need for GUI things like Gnome or KDE :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh great, your email arrived early in the morning when I had just logged into my system, so things are a little bleak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to run a stock system from whatever vendor I happen to install at the moment, with the ever-present addition of exmh as my email agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my desktop I am still running SuSE V7.3, with all the patches installed from their excellent internet-based update service. I just have not gotten around to updating to V8.0. On this system I tend to use KDE for no other reason than becoming familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my IBM Thinkpad notebook I am running SuSE V8.0, but I tend to use GNOME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both systems I tend to install as much software as my hard disk can hold, it is just that you can’t see it because I have not started executing it yet. I also install Open Office and Applixware for capatability with other people sending me things, but I am switching over to Open Office because of the openness of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not tend to listen to music through my workstation, since that both distracts me and wastes cpu power. My workstation is a dual CPU, 500 MHZ system, but I like things to work fast, not be bogged down with decompressing music, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will include both the screenshot of the desktop and the notebook, but I think your readers will be disappointed in my blandness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My desktop is pretty boring. I use five computers with some degree of regularity. Four of them, I regret to say, are Windows machines, because that’s what is available. I use them (a) to run ssh to get to my prime machine, and (b) to look at powerpoint, Excel, and Word files. The main machine is Freebsd running plain vanilla Xwindows. So all the desktop looks like is five windows tiling the screen with a small empty space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a man and a woman looking at the camera: Marge and Jerry Selbee&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; src=&quot;https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AACCY66.img?h=373&amp;amp;w=624&amp;amp;m=6&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;o=t&amp;amp;l=f&amp;amp;x=864&amp;amp;y=405&quot; title=&quot;Marge and Jerry Selbee - Provided by CBS Interactive Inc.&quot; width=&quot;624&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
Last year, Americans spent more than $80 billion playing state lotteries. That's around $250 for each citizen, more than what was spent on concerts, sporting events and movie tickets combined. 
&lt;p&gt;Over 25 states took in more from their lottery proceeds than from corporate income tax. Because of these stakes, it's essential that-in both perception and reality-lotteries are truly games of chance, everyone entering with an equal opportunity to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why investigators took note when a retired couple from Michigan, Jerry and Marge Selbee, made $26 million winning various state lottery games dozens of times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a story, though, of a con, or a scam, or an inside job. No, as we first told you in January, this is a ballad of a couple from smalltown America who did something that most people only dream of. They didn't so much as beat the lottery odds as they figured them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, high school sweethearts Jerry and Marge Selbee lived a quiet life in Evart, Michigan, population 1900. A single-stoplight factory-town that collapses in the folds of a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together they raised six kids and ran a local convenience store on Main Street. Jerry handled the liquor and cigarettes and Marge kept the books and made the sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: How long did you have the store?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Why'd you decide to sell it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: I was 62. Marge was 63. And I thought it was a nice time to sell and see what we could do after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: You're in your early 60s, you decide to retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both: Uh-huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: You're gonna put your feet up. What was the plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Yeah (chuckle) that was basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: I don't think we had one per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: That was basically it.  We were gonna enjoy life a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one morning in 2003, Jerry happened to walk back into the corner store and spotted a brochure for a brand new lottery game called Winfall.  Jerry always possessed what he calls, &quot;a head for math.&quot; He has a bachelor's degree in the subject from nearby Western Michigan University. And in only a matter of minutes, he realized that this was a unique game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: I read it and by the time I was out here I knew what the potential might be.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: It did not take you weeks to suss this out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: No, no, not at all. Three minutes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Three minutes and you found the loophole in the state lottery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Three minutes. I found-- I found a special feature. (laughs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feature was called a &quot;Rolldown&quot;, and the lottery announced when it was coming. Unlike the Mega Millions games you've probably heard of where the jackpot keeps building until someone hits all six numbers and wins the big prize, in Winfall, if the jackpot reached $5 million, and no one matched all six numbers, all the money 'rolled down'  to the lower-tier prize winners, dramatically boosting the payouts of those who matched five, four or three numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound complicated?  Well, it wasn't to Jerry.  See if you can stick with him here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Here's what I said. I said if I played $1,100 mathematically I'd have one 4-number winner, that's 1,000 bucks.  I divided 1,100 by six instead of 57 because I did a mental quick dirty and I come up with 18. So I knew I'd have either 18 or 19 3-number winners and that's 50 bucks each. At 18 I got $1,000 for a 4-number winner, and I got 18 3-number winners worth $50 each, so that's 900 bucks. So I got $1,100 invested and I've got a $1,900 return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Sounds like good math&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: That's-- yeah (laugh)  a little over 80 percent isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: You're talking about this as if it's the most obvious set of figures in the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: it is. (Chuckle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: This is not taxing the outer limits of your math skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: No, it is actually it's just basic arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Are you thinking, &quot;I bet there are a million people that have also caught onto this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Exactly, is what I thought.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a rolldown was announced, Jerry sprang into action. He bought $3,600 in Winfall tickets and won $6,300. Then he bet $8,000 and nearly doubled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: At that point, I told Marge what I was doing. (Laugh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: I was gonna say, you're putting thousands of dollars in action on the state lottery game, at what point do you share this with your wife?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Right at that point&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Jerry says, &quot;I think I've cracked the Michigan State Lottery.&quot; What do you say to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: He just, you know (chuckle) it didn't surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: You weren't surprised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: No, I wasn't surprised. Because as long as nobody wins and you win money, you could see the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: So when you realized there aren't a million people that have discovered this, it's pretty much just you, what's that feeling like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Amazed. (Laugh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Amazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: Pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: I just couldn't, I just couldn't fathom it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon Jerry and Marge Selbee started playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Jerry set up a corporation, G.S. Investment Strategies. He showed us stacks of record books that detailed their winnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Here's one that was pretty successful. We played $515,000 and we got back $853,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: It's about a 60 percent return?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: That was a good return. (Laugh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They invited family and friends to share in their, well, windfall, selling shares in the corporation for $500 apiece. You might say this was a different kind of hedge fund. We met some of the local investors at the evart hangout spot, Sugar Rae's Café.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: All four of you guys are members of an exclusive club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All: Yeah. (laugh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James White is a local attorney, Dave Huff operated a machine and tool shop and brothers Loren and Ray Gerber are retired farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James White: And when you looked at the mathematics of it, it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Do you guys remember how much you gave him to invest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loren Gerber: I had about $8,000 and then I put another six in for the grandkids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: For the grandkids?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loren Gerber: Yeah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: But overall you guys came out way ahead on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All: Oh yeah, oh yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loren Gerber: It was a good game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Huff: It helped me put three kids through school and one through law school. So it was quite beneficial to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Used it for education?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Huff: Pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James White: There's a lot of people around town that knew what it was about and talk about it and that it occurred.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Huff: But a lot of people were really leery.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loren Gerber: You bet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave Huff: They were thinking, &quot;You guys are nuts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the spring of 2005, Jerry's club stood at 25 members. Those willing to press their luck included three state troopers, a factory plant manager, and a bank vice president. They had played Winfall 12 times, winning millions. When Michigan suddenly shut down the game, citing, ironically, lack of sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Michigan game gets closed down. How long before you realize there was a game in Massachusetts that also presented some favorable odds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: One of our players emailed me and he said &quot;Massachusetts has a game called Cash Winfall. Do you think we could play that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: I've heard that..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: And so I got on the computer. I looked at the game and once I researched it, I got back with him and I said, we can play that game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: We got another winner. How long did it take you this time to figure out that you could get a positive return here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when Jerry and Marge Selbee developed a routine they continued for the next six years, driving 900 miles to Massachusetts every time there was a rolldown and buying hundreds of thousands of tickets at two local convenience stores. Then they holed up, not in some fancy suite at the high rollers hotel, but in a room at the Red Roof Inn, sorting the tickets by hand for 10 hours a day, 10 days straight, not so much playing the lottery, as working it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: So once there was a rolldown, on average, how much were you putting in play?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Over $600,000 per play. Seven plays a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: $4.2 million once this rolldown was coming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Did you ever get nervous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: Oh yeah. (laugh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: What'd you do with all the losing tickets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Saved them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: You saved all the losing tickets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: Saved them in big totes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Big plastic totes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: There must have been millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: $18 million worth of losing tickets. And you have those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh just in case we had a physical federal audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: We had the upstairs of the barn. I stored them in one end and in the other end. And then I thought, &quot;Oh no, this floor is gonna fall through.&quot; So then we stored them down in the pole barn. And we had probably 60, 65 tubs of tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Did you guys ever say, &quot;We're supposed to be retired here. We're making 14-hour drives to Massachusetts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: We're having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: It's fun for you guys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: It's fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: It's fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marge Selbee: You get a high on it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: And it gave you the satisfaction of being successful at something that was worthwhile to not only us personally but to our friends and our family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2011, the Boston Globe got a tip and discovered that in certain Massachussetts locations, Cash Winfall tickets were being sold at an extraordinary volume.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Allen: Smart people had figured out if I buy enough of these tickets, I'll always be a winner. I'll get back more than I spent.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott allen oversees the Globe's investigative reporters, known as the Spotlight team. The paper's reporting revealed that two groups were dominating Cash Winfall: the Selbee gang from Evart, Michigan, and their competition, a syndicate led by math majors from MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These were kids young enough to be the Selbees' grandchildren.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Allen: The guy who started it, he was doing an independent study project as an undergraduate at MIT and he figured out that he could win this game. So he got a bunch of his friends to pool in their money so they became, as time went on, professional Cash Winfall players, recruiting their friends and raising money from backers until they too were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, the MIT group bet between $17 and $18 million on Cash Winfall over a seven-year period, earning at least $3.5 million in profits. Almost the exact same rate of return as the Selbees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: You've got a syndicate from Northwest Michigan, you've got a group of MIT students. Did your story meter start beeping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Allen: It was-- oh it's a great story.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boston Globe articles caused a sensation, raising suspicion that the game was rigged.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts state treasurer shut down the Cash Winfall game and called for an investigation. It was led by then-state inspector general, Greg Sullivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Sullivan: When we got involved, the public perception was there must be some kind of organized crime or public corruption to explain how millions of dollars are being bet by syndicates on state lottery tickets. We really looked at this, looking for corruption. We used subpoenas, we looked at documents, we interviewed dozens of people to look at this in detail with a hypothesis that something illegal had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: You went into this looking for organized crime. As the story unfolded, were you surprised by what you found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Sullivan: I wasn't surprised. I was dumbfoundely amazed that these math-nerd geniuses had found a way legally to win a state lottery and make millions from it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: And the state's getting rich in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Sullivan: And the state got very rich. The state made $120 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation found no one's odds of winning was affected by high-volume betting. When the jackpot hit the rolldown threshold, Cash Winfall became a good bet for everyone, not just the big time bettors like the Selbees. By then though, Massachusetts State Lottery had moved on to a different game without a statistical twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, Jerry and Marge Selbee's excellent adventure drew to an end.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, their unlikely homegrown company grossed more than $26 million from nine years of playing the lottery.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Your corporation, $26 million. You smile when you recounted that figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Uh-huh. That was satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: Satisfactory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: Yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made nearly $8 million in profit before taxes. Back in Evart, not exactly the land of extravagance, the Selbees put their winnings to practical use, renovating their home and helping their six kids, 14 grandkids and 10 great-grandchildren pay for their education. They still get together with members of their lottery group. But millions of dollars in Winfall tickets have been replaced by nickel and dime poker night, and Marge makes everyone chicken pot pie.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: I'm struck by how measured you are, telling this story. Do you find anything remarkable about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: The only thing I found really remarkable is nobody else really seemed to grasp it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Wertheim: What I'm hearing you say is that this part of the country is really good at keeping a secret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry Selbee: (Laugh)&lt;/p&gt;
