<title>Clayton Christensen has died</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;BTtrxD&quot;&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Clayton Christensen, whose theory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/disruptive-innovation-2/&quot;&gt;disruptive innovation&lt;/a&gt; made him a key influence on Silicon Valley powerhouses like Netflix and Intel and twice earned him the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2013/11/17/20529798/mormon-professor-named-world-s-top-management-thinker-delivers-emotional-speech&quot;&gt;the world’s most influential living management thinker&lt;/a&gt;, died Jan. 23 at age 67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JnDi73&quot;&gt;His brother, Carlton, told the Deseret News that Christensen died Thursday evening of complications from cancer in Boston, Massachusetts, where he had been a notable part of the Latter-day Saint community for over 40 years. He was considered an equally robust spiritual thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;DP5cZ3&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;8qd6M4&quot;&gt;Christensen introduced disruptive innovation in the Harvard Business Review &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave&quot;&gt;in 1995&lt;/a&gt;, but the theory and the term burst into the public consciousness in 1997 when he published “The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail.” Soon afterward, Intel CEO Andy Grove stood up with a copy of the book at COMDEX in Las Vegas and declared it the most important book he’d read in a decade. The two men appeared together on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0125/6302088a.html#1d9183b05c86&quot;&gt;cover of Forbes magazine&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 — and both Christensen and the business world were changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RuS3uz&quot;&gt;Christensen initially used the term “disruptive technologies.” Grove dubbed it the “Christensen Effect.” After Christensen altered it to “disruptive innovation,” the term became ubiquitous. Five years ago, the Economist said it had long since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/01/25/what-disruptive-innovation-means&quot;&gt;entered the zeitgeist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JIYoze&quot;&gt;Though he coined the term, Christensen grew uncomfortable with it as he saw it overused and misapplied. He utilized it narrowly to describe innovations that upended existing markets, but only if they fit a certain pattern he had discovered. A true disruptive innovation, he taught, first appealed only to a niche market and appeared less attractive than the powerful incumbent it eventually usurped. In fact, the incumbent typically looked down on it as inconsequential until it ate up huge swaths of its market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dN7ALL&quot;&gt;Netflix CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/netflix-why-att-bought-time-warner-and-comcast-and-disney-want-fox.html&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; “The Innovator’s Dilemma” with his team. The biographer of Steve Jobs said the book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2011/10/what-did-steve-jobs-read/&quot;&gt;deeply influenced”&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s co-founder. Jeff Bezos &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2013/10/jeff-bezos-read-these-books/&quot;&gt;tells&lt;/a&gt; his Amazon executives to read another Christensen book, “The Innovator’s Solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tnGlh9&quot;&gt;A masterful storyteller, Christensen was a perfect fit for Harvard’s case study method and the way CEOs thought and acted. He shared his case studies with roomfuls of CEOs. His story about the disruption of steel mills gripped Grove, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;K9fpxd&quot;&gt;Christensen’s timing was perfect, according to an exhaustive New Yorker profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0lRdHf&quot;&gt;“It was the turn of the millennium, dot-com businesses were springing up all over the place, Digital Equipment Corporation, a giant of the computer age, was disintegrating, and AOL was suddenly and inexplicably worth as much as Time Warner,” the author wrote. “Obviously, everybody had to be on guard, but against what? Into this chaos and uncertainty came Christensen, telling his story about the steel industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DZt4Nz&quot;&gt;Grove applied that story to help Intel ward off a disruption that could have undone the company. He did what flocks of CEOs would, bringing Christensen in to speak to vast teams at Intel. Grove then identified low-end personal computers as a potential disruptive innovation that threatened the high-end computer chip maker, and he instructed his managers and sales team to focus on them. Soon, Intel introduced the cheaper Celeron chip. Within a year, Intel owned 35% of the market share for chips in cheaper personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fmzw81&quot;&gt;Grove, who died in 2016, credited Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k8Ap17&quot;&gt;“Clay created a way of thinking that gave others the tools and the framework to discover things that had never been thought of before, to see things they could never have seen on their own,” said Clark Gilbert, a Christensen protegé and president of BYU-Pathway Worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vSIJZR&quot;&gt;Christensen died nearly a month after Gary Starkweather, the man whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-starkweather-invented-a-laser-printer-at-xerox-11579024691&quot;&gt;idea for the laser printer&lt;/a&gt; made Xerox a powerhouse. Eventually, the powerhouse printer company became the subject of another Christensen story on a disrupted industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b4znyn&quot;&gt;“We were heartbroken to learn today of the passing of Clayton Christensen,” said Nitin Nohria, dean of the Harvard Business School, in a statement shared Friday with the Deseret News. “His loss will be felt deeply throughout our community. Clayton’s brilliance and kindness were equally evident to everyone he met, and his legacy will be long-lasting. Through his research and teaching, he fundamentally shaped the practice of business and influenced generations of students and scholars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6MmizX&quot;&gt;Disruptive innovation became a ubiquitous term. Cable channels produced “disruptor lists.” Some observers said the term’s use added sophistication to any discussion. Others complained it was overused. Various forms of it regularly pop up in discussions about sports, for example. To his chagrin, users often apply it as a synonym for anything new or transformative, not understanding Christensen’s actual theory. The ubiquity worried him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;adNFeE&quot;&gt;“If we call every business success a ‘disruption,’ then companies that rise to the top in very different ways will be seen as sources of insight into a common strategy for succeeding,” he once said. “This creates a danger: Managers may mix and match behaviors that are very likely inconsistent with one another and thus unlikely to yield the hoped-for result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0tg2P3&quot;&gt;He second-guessed the wording of the label, but never the theory. Even after he changed his terminology to disruptive innovation, he saw flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bTWrWZ&quot;&gt;“What we didn’t anticipate, and what in many ways was a fault of mine,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/801706/innovation-guru-clayton-christensens-new-theory-will-help-protect-you-from-disruption/&quot;&gt;he told Quartz&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, “was that the term disruption has so many different connotations in the English language, that it allows people to justify whatever they want to do as, ‘Oh, this is disruptive,’ and they don’t ever read the book. The population of people where the fewest have read the book are venture capitalists. They are arrogant and smart and why do they need to read something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yd8Jiy&quot;&gt;He wished he’d created something less expressive. He began to discuss type 1 innovations and type 2 innovations, with a nod to Daniel Kahneman, because he believed those terms were vague enough to force people to read and understand his work more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VgXM3b&quot;&gt;“The misconception around the term is that it’s an innovation or technology that somehow is simply new and cutting edge, in the sense of that no one’s ever done it before,” said Gilbert, a former president of the Deseret News. “But a disruptive technology most often innovates in a way that looks inferior. A disruptive innovation appears inferior to incumbents and underperforms on traditional measures. Then the innovation evolves and actually opens up a whole new category of consumption to users and consumers who could never have consumed it before because it was either too expensive, or required too much expertise to consume. Many think it means newer, better, faster, but what Clay actually found was that a disruptive innovation doesn’t appear as a better product but as one that makes it more accessible or more affordable to a much wider audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QdisNX&quot;&gt;Grove told Christensen he mislabeled his theory. Instead of innovative technologies, Grove suggested, Christensen should have used “crummy technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2vjOkC&quot;&gt;“A disruptive innovation looks inferior,” Gilbert said, “but only to the incumbent organizations. Then it opens up the ability to consume something that never would have been possible without the innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yZTclL&quot;&gt;Whatever the name, the theory itself galvanized Silicon Valley and Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;R7lcFd&quot;&gt;Apple’s Jobs regularly quoted “The Innovator’s Dilemma.” It received the Global Business Book Award in 1997 and the Economist named it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/06/30/aiming-high&quot;&gt;one of the six best business books&lt;/a&gt; ever published. Three years ago, Quartz.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/801706/innovation-guru-clayton-christensens-new-theory-will-help-protect-you-from-disruption/&quot;&gt;called Christensen&lt;/a&gt; “possibly the most influential management thinker in Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PyEtBP&quot;&gt;Criticism occasionally stung Christensen. However, he used it to fuel refinements to his theory, on which he never stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GMRQf5&quot;&gt;“There are criticisms that are very important,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/801706/innovation-guru-clayton-christensens-new-theory-will-help-protect-you-from-disruption/&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; one interviewer. “Never does a theory just pop out in complete form. But rather, the first appearance of the theory is half-baked. Then it improves when people say, ‘it doesn’t account for this,’ or ‘this is an anomaly and it doesn’t explain that.’ It’s very important to have people willing to criticize it for that purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e4hbB0&quot;&gt;He created the Clayton Christensen Institute for Disruptive Innovation to continue refining his life’s work. He also founded Rose Park Advisors to invest in companies based on his theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zSB1Q1&quot;&gt;The final dozen years of his life were marked by health concerns. In 2007, he suffered a heart attack. In late 2009, he was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. While speaking in a church meeting in 2010, he suffered a stroke that left him with expressive aphasia. The storyteller still could think and reason but no longer had the ability to direct his mouth to express the words in his head. He worked ceaselessly and successfully to relearn how to speak, but he had trouble finding words the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GBFJ7g&quot;&gt;Carlton Christensen said his brother had been under treatment for leukemia for the past year, a rare result of his previous cancer treatment. He was hospitalized Jan. 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oU7xi4&quot;&gt;In 2012, after Thinkers50 ranked him the world’s most influential living management thinker for the first time, The New Yorker published an 8,800-word profile titled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/14/when-giants-fail&quot;&gt;When Giants Fail&lt;/a&gt;.” The title referred to the corporate titans taken down by disruptive innovations, but Christensen, too, was a giant at 6-foot-8. The New Yorker author referred to his height in the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZQnhS4&quot;&gt;His work will outlast him. Just last week, Forbes published an article titled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlesbeames/2020/01/15/its-our-choice-solve-the-innovators-dilemma-or-perish/#154648395ed9&quot;&gt;It’s Our Choice, Solve the Innovator’s Dilemma or Perish&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Nru64z&quot;&gt;The regular use of disruption was illustrated last month when The Wall Street Journal published a special section reviewing the last decade under the banner headline “Decade of Disruption.” The story could have referred to Christensen because his continued work remained dominant. Thinkers50 released global rankings of management thinkers four times between 2011 and 2017; Christensen finished first, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2013/11/17/20529798/mormon-professor-named-world-s-top-management-thinker-delivers-emotional-speech&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;, second and third. The final time, the list called him “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkers50.com/media/thinkers50-ranking-of-management-thinkers-announced/&quot;&gt;the disruptive guru&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;94L7V1&quot;&gt;Michael Horn, who co-founded the Clayton Christensen Institute, said it would remain committed to his legacy and continue his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UMulGZ&quot;&gt;“Clay leaves behind an incredible tree of researchers and acolytes and practitioners who will continue to not only spread what he learned in his lifetime but also continue to improve the theory, ultimately, and not only that theory but the other theories that Clay developed,” Horn said. “Clay was someone who believed that a theory was something you could continue to improve as more information and more understanding of the world came into view, and ideas shouldn’t stand still, in effect. It was more important get truth than be right. He leaves behind a whole slew of people, not just at the institute, but around the world, like Bob Moesta (CEO of the Re-Wired Group), Scott Anthony (Innosight), Clark Gilbert and others who will continue to perfect the ideas and put them into action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jTDvtV&quot;&gt;Christensen applied his innovation theory to self-help in a book titled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://deseretbook.com/p/ppr-how-will-you-measure-your-life?variant_id=152408-paperback&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6fn-mLqa5wIVEb7ACh2egg8bEAQYASABEgIAavD_BwE&quot;&gt;How Will You Measure Your Life&lt;/a&gt;?” It began as a speech to the Class of 2010 at the Harvard Business School. The Harvard Business Review printed a version &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/05/08/the-most-important-decision-of-your-life-you-make-every-day/#2d8a270d32aa&quot;&gt;to acclaim&lt;/a&gt;. He gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvos4nORf_Y&quot;&gt;a TEDx Talk on the subject&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XvVmTr&quot;&gt;The Harvard Business Review’s online version carries an editor’s note that says, “Though Christensen’s thinking comes from his deep religious faith, we believe that these are strategies anyone can use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;erMXUK&quot;&gt;Gilbert said his mentor had a unique capacity to bridge spiritual and secular dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pNppqF&quot;&gt;“People who didn’t believe in God or who weren’t religious found themselves reflecting on spiritual ideas because of the conversations and writings of Clay Christensen. ‘How Will You Measure Your Life’ influenced so many people,” Gilbert said. “He had this ability to unapologetically and with deep conviction and courage talk about things of faith and of God with people who didn’t think they were religious. He found ways of not only engaging them personally but engaging them intellectually in a way that caused them to start to really actually think about spiritual matters in a way that they never would have without someone like Clay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zwSMli&quot;&gt;Born in the Rose Park area west of the railroad tracks in Salt Lake City, Christensen as a child read the World Book Encyclopedia from A to Z. He served as a missionary in Korea for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1971 to 1973. After he completed a bachelor’s degree from BYU, he earned a master’s as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England, followed by an MBA and later a doctorate at Harvard. He had been a professor in the business school since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Oo4ny1&quot;&gt;In addition to 10 books on business, he wrote about his Latter-day Saint faith, which he summed up in a document called, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://claytonchristensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Why_I_Belong_and_Why_I_Believe.pdf&quot;&gt;Why I Belong, and Why I Believe&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ns6Aor&quot;&gt;His book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2012/12/26/20511635/clayton-christensen-hopes-the-power-of-everyday-missionaries-spurs-discussion-about-member-missionar#clayton-m-christensen-is-the-kim-b-clark-professor-of-business-administration-at-the-harvard-business-school-at-heart-he-also-sees-himself-as-a-missionary-for-the-lds-church&quot;&gt;The Power of Everyday Missionaries: The What and How of Sharing the Gospel&lt;/a&gt;” is a popular work on the topic. He was a driving force behind and wrote the foreword for Kristen Smith Dayley’s book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2012/12/22/20511535/for-all-the-saints-shares-lessons-of-faith-and-testimony-for-latter-day-saints&quot;&gt;For All the Saints&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;AsoN4P&quot;&gt;His team won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/171835-master-of-orion-dos-front-cover/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4175&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4175&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/171835-master-of-orion-dos-front-cover-258x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;258&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/171835-master-of-orion-dos-front-cover-258x300.jpg 258w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/171835-master-of-orion-dos-front-cover-768x892.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/171835-master-of-orion-dos-front-cover-500x581.jpg 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/171835-master-of-orion-dos-front-cover.jpg 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the shadow which the original &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; still casts over the gaming landscape of today, one might be forgiven for assuming, as many younger gamers doubtless do, that it was the very first conquer-the-galaxy grand-strategy game ever made. The reality, however, is quite different. For all that its position of influence is hardly misbegotten for other very good reasons, it was already the heir to a long tradition of such games at the time of its release in 1993. In fact, the tradition dates back to well before computer games as we know them today even existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roots of the strategic space opera can be traced back to the tabletop game known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, designed by Allan B. Calhamer and first published in 1959 by Avalon Hill. Taking place in the years just prior to World War I, it put seven players in the roles of leaders of the various “great powers” of Europe. Although it included a playing board, tokens, and most of the other accoutrements of a typical board game, the real action, at least if you were playing it properly, was entirely social, in the alliances that were forged and broken and the shady deals that were struck. In this respect, it presaged many of the ideas that would later go into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/dungeons-and-dragons&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other role-playing games. It thus represents an instant in gaming history as seminal in its own way as the 1954 publication of Avalon Hill’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31766/tactics&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the canonical first tabletop wargame and the one which touched off the hobby of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2011/07/the-rise-of-experiential-games&quot;&gt;experiential gaming&lt;/a&gt; in general. But just as importantly for our purposes, &lt;em&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt;‘s shifting alliances and the back-stabbings they led to would become an essential part of countless strategic space operas, including &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; 34 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because getting seven friends together in the same room for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g844EvintEc&quot;&gt;all-day affair&lt;/a&gt; that was a complete game of &lt;em&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt; was almost as hard in the 1960s as it is today, inventive gamers developed systems for playing it via post; the first example of this breed would seem to date from 1963. And once players had started modifying the rules of &lt;em&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt; to make it work under this new paradigm, it was a relatively short leap to begin making entirely new play-by-post games with new themes which shared some commonalities of approach with Calhamer’s magnum opus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in December of 1966, Dan Brannon announced a play-by-post game called &lt;em&gt;Xeno&lt;/em&gt;, whose concept sounds very familiar indeed in the broad strokes. Each player started with a cluster of five planets — a tiny toehold in a sprawling, unknown galaxy waiting to be colonized. “The vastness of the playing space, the secrecy of the identity of the other players, the secrecy of the locations of ships and planets, the total lack of information without efforts of investigation, all these factors are meant to create the real problems of a race trying to expand to other planets,” wrote Brannon. Although the new game would be like &lt;em&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/em&gt; in that it would presumably still culminate in negotiations, betrayals, and the inevitable final war to determine the ultimate victor, these stages would now be preceded by those of exploration and colonization, until a galaxy that had seemed so unfathomably big at the start proved not to be big enough to accommodate all of its would-be space empires. Certainly all of this too will be familiar to any player of &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; or one of its heirs. Brannon’s game even included a tech tree of sorts, with players able to acquire better engines, weapons, and shields for their ships every eight turns they managed to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, &lt;em&gt;Xeno&lt;/em&gt; played out at a pace to which the word “glacial” hardly does justice. The game didn’t really get started until September of 1967, and by a year after that just three turns had been completed. I don’t know whether a single full game of it was ever finished. Nevertheless, it proved hugely influential within the small community of experiential-gaming fanzines and play-by-post enthusiasts. The first similar game, called &lt;em&gt;Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; and run by H. David Montgomery, had already appeared before &lt;em&gt;Xeno&lt;/em&gt; had processed its third turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the idea was, literally and figuratively speaking, too big for the medium for which it had been devised; it was just too compelling to remain confined to those few stalwart souls with the patience for play-by-post gaming. It soon branched out into two new mediums, each of which offered a more immediate sort of satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, following rejections from Avalon Hill and others, one Howard Thompson formed his own company to publish the face-to-face board game &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1708/stellar-conquest&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stellar Conquest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first strategic space opera to appear in an actual box on store shelves. When &lt;em&gt;Stellar Conquest&lt;/em&gt; became a success, it spawned a string of similar board games with titles like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2503/godsfire&quot;&gt;Godsfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3663/outreach-conquest-galaxy-3000ad&quot;&gt;Outreach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14561/second-empire&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Empire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2743/starfall&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during this, the heyday of experiential gaming on the tabletop. But the big problem with such games was their sheer scope and math-heavy nature, which were enough to test the limits of many a salty old grognard who usually reveled in complexity. They all took at least three or four hours to play in their simplest variants, and a single game of at least one of them — SPI’s &lt;em&gt;Outreach&lt;/em&gt; — could absorb weeks of gaming Saturdays. Meanwhile they were all dependent on pages and pages of fiddly manual calculations, in the time before spreadsheet macros or even handheld calculators were commonplace. (One hates to contemplate the plight of the &lt;em&gt;Outreach&lt;/em&gt; group who have just spent the last two months resolving who shall become master of the galaxy, only to discover that the victor made a mistake on her production worksheet back on the second turn which invalidated all of the numbers that followed…) These games were, in other words, crying out for computerization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, then, that too had already started to happen by the end of the 1970s. One of the reasons that play-by-post games of this type tended to run so sluggishly — beyond, that is, the inherent sluggishness of the medium itself — came down to the same problem as that faced by their tabletop progeny: the burden their size and complexity placed on their administrators. Therefore in 1976, Rick Loomis, the founder of a little company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/02/friends-of-the-wasteland-the-legacy-of-flying-buffalo&quot;&gt;Flying Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, started running the commercial play-by-post game &lt;em&gt;Starweb&lt;/em&gt; on what gaming historian Shannon Appelcline has called “probably the first computer ever purchased exclusively to play games” (or, at least, to administrate them): a $14,000 Raytheon 704 minicomputer. He would continue to run &lt;em&gt;Starweb&lt;/em&gt; for more than thirty years — albeit presumably not on the same computer throughout that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the first full-fledged incarnation of the computerized strategic space opera — in the sense of a self-contained game meant to be played locally on a single computer — arrived only in 1983. Called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/reach-for-the-stars-the-conquest-of-the-galaxy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reach for the Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was the first fruit of what would turn into a long-running and prolific partnership between the Aussies Roger Keating and Ian Trout, who in that rather grandiose fashion that was so typical of grognard culture had named themselves the Strategic Studies Group. &lt;em&gt;Reach for the Stars&lt;/em&gt; was based so heavily upon &lt;em&gt;Stellar Conquest&lt;/em&gt; that it’s been called an outright unlicensed clone. Nevertheless, it’s a remarkable achievement for the way that it manages to capture that sense of size and scope that is such a huge part of these games’ appeal on 8-bit Apple IIs and Commodore 64s with just 64 K of memory. Although the whole is necessarily rather bare-bones compared to what would come later, the computer players’ artificial intelligence, always a point of pride with Keating and Trout, is surprisingly effective; on the harder difficulty level, the computer can truly give you a run for your money, and seems to do so without relying solely on egregious cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4176&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/reach/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4176&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4176&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4176&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reach-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reach-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reach-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reach.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4176&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;It doesn’t look like much, but the basic hallmarks of the strategic space opera are all there in &lt;em&gt;Reach for the Stars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reach for the Stars&lt;/em&gt; did very well, prompting updated ports to more powerful machines like the Apple Macintosh and IIGS and the Commodore Amiga as the decade wore on. A modest trickle of other boxed computer games of a similar stripe also appeared, albeit none which did much to comprehensively improve on SSG’s effort: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/imperium-galactum&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imperium Galactum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://macintoshgarden.org/games/spaceward-ho-4&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spaceward Ho!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/armada-2525&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armada 2525&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://macintoshgarden.org/games/pax-imperia&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pax Imperia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile the commercial online service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/a-net-before-the-web-part-1-the-establishment-man-and-the-magnificent-rogue&quot;&gt;CompuServe&lt;/a&gt; offered up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/12/games-on-the-net-before-the-web-part-1-strategy-and-simulation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MegaWars III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which up to 100 players vied for control of the galaxy; it played a bit like one of those years-long play-by-post campaigns of yore compressed into four to six weeks of constant — and expensive, given CompuServe’s hourly dial-up rates — action and intrigue. Even the shareware scene got in on the act, via titles like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/anacreon-reconstruction-4021&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anacreon: Reconstruction 4021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the earliest versions of the cult classic &lt;em&gt;VGA Planets&lt;/em&gt;, a game which is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://planets.nu&quot;&gt;actively maintained and played&lt;/a&gt; to this day. And then, finally, along came &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; in 1993 to truly take this style of game to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had things gone just a little bit differently, &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; too might have been a shareware release. It was designed in the spare time of Steve Barcia, an electrical engineer living in Austin, Texas, and programmed by Steve himself, his wife Marcia Barcia, and their friend Ken Burd. Steve claims not ever to have played any of the computer games I’ve just mentioned, but, as an avid and longtime tabletop gamer, he was very familiar with &lt;em&gt;Stellar Conquest&lt;/em&gt; and a number of its successors. (No surprise there: Howard Thompson and his game were in fact also products of Austin’s vibrant board-gaming scene.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working on their computer game, which they called &lt;a href=&quot;https://moo3.quicksilver.com/game/starlords.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Lords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on and off for years, the little band of hobbyist programmers submitted it to MicroProse, whose grand-strategy game of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-2-playing-civilization&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a creation of their leading in-house designer Sid Meier, had just taken the world by storm. A MicroProse producer named Jeff Johannigman — himself another member of the Austin gaming fraternity, as it happened, one who had just left Origin Systems in Austin to join MicroProse up in Baltimore — took a shine to the unpolished gem and signed its creators to develop it further. Seeing their hobby about to become a real business, the trio quit their jobs, took the name of SimTex, and leased a cramped office above a gyro joint to finish their game under Johannigman’s remote supervision, with a little additional help from MicroProse’s art department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fellow named Alan Emrich was one of most prominent voices in strategy-game criticism at the time; he was the foremost scribe on the subject at &lt;em&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/em&gt; magazine, the industry’s accepted journal of record, and had just published a book-length strategy guide on &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; in tandem with Johnny Wilson, the same magazine’s senior editor. Thanks to that project, Emrich was well-connected with MicroProse, and was happy to serve as a sounding board for them. And so, one fateful day very early in 1993, Johannigman asked if he’d like to have a look at a new submission called &lt;em&gt;Star Lords&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Emrich himself puts it, his initial impressions “were not that great.” He remembers thinking the game looked like “something from the late 1980s” — an eternity in the fast-changing computing scene of the early 1990s. Yet there was just &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; about it; the more he played, the more he wanted to keep playing. So, he shared &lt;em&gt;Star Lords&lt;/em&gt; with his friend Tom Hughes, with whom he’d been playing tabletop and computerized strategy games for twenty years. Hughes had the same experience. Emrich:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After intense, repeated playing of the game, Tom and I were soon making numerous suggestions to [Johannigman], who, in turn, got tired of passing them on to the designer and lead programmer, Steve Barcia. Soon, we were talking to Steve directly. The telephone lines were burning regularly and a lot of ideas went back and forth. All the while, Steve was cooking up a better and better game. It was during this time that the title changed to Master of Orion and the game’s theme and focus crystallized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a sneak preview for Computer Gaming World magazine where I indicated that Master of Orion was shaping up to be a good game. It had a lot of promise, but I didn’t think it was up there with Sid Meier’s Civilization, the hobby’s hallmark of strategy gaming at that time. But by the time that story hit the newsstands, I had changed my mind. I found myself still playing the game constantly and was reflecting on that fact when Tom called me. We talked about Master of Orion, of course, and Tom said, “You know, I think this game might become more addicting even than Civilization.” I replied, “You know, I think it already is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hard on Emrich in earlier articles for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/the-game-of-everything-part-1-making-civilization&quot;&gt;silly assertion&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;‘s inclusion of global warming as a threat to progress and women’s suffrage as a Wonder of the World constituted some form of surrender to left-wing political correctness, as I was for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/05/the-game-of-everything-part-9-civilization-and-economics&quot;&gt;even sillier assertion&lt;/a&gt; that the game’s simplistic and highly artificial economic model could somehow be held up as proof for the pseudo-scientific theory of trickle-down economics. Therefore let me be very clear in praising him here: Emrich and Hughes played an absolutely massive role in making &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; one of the greatest strategy games of all time. Their contribution was such that SimTex took the unusual step of adding to the credits listing a “Special Thanks to Alan Emrich and Tom Hughes for their invaluable design critiquing and suggestions.” If anything, that credit would seem to be more ungenerous than the opposite. By all indications, a pair of full-fledged co-designer credits wouldn’t have been out of proportion to the reality of their contribution. The two would go on to write the exhaustive official strategy guide for the game, a tome numbering more than 400 pages. No one could have been more qualified to tackle that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if all that wasn’t enough, Emrich did one more great service for &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; and, one might even say, for gaming in general. In a “revealing sneak preview” of the game, published in the September 1993 issue of &lt;em&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/em&gt;, he pronounced it to be “rated XXXX.” After the requisite measure of back-patting for such edgy turns of phrase as these, Emrich settled down to explain what he really meant by the label: “XXXX” in this context stood for “EXplore, EXpand, EXploit, and EXterminate.” And thus was a new sub-genre label born. The formulation from the article was quickly shortened to “4X” by enterprising gamers uninterested in making strained allusions to pornographic films. In that form, it would be applied to countless titles going forward, right up to the present day, and retroactively applied to countless titles of the past, including all of the earlier space operas I’ve just described as well as the original &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; — a game to which the “EXterminate” part of the label fits perhaps less well, but such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emrich’s article also creates an amusing distinction for the more pedantic ludic taxonomists and linguists among us. Although &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; definitely was not, as we’ve now seen at some length, the first 4X game in the abstract, it was the very first 4X game to be &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt; a 4X game. Maybe this accounts for some of the pride of place it holds in modern gaming culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However that may be, though, the lion’s share of the credit for &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;‘s enduring influence must surely be ascribed to what a superb game it is in its own right. If it didn’t invent the 4X space opera, it did in some sense perfect it, at least in its digital form. It doesn’t do anything conceptually &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; on the face of it — you’re still leading an alien race as it expands through a randomly created galaxy, competing with other races in the fields of economics, technology, diplomacy, and warfare to become the dominant civilization — but it just does it all so &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_012/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4177&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4177&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_012-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_012-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_012-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_012.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new game of &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; begins with you choosing a galaxy size (from small to huge), a difficulty level (from simple to impossible), and a quantity of opposing aliens to compete against (from one to five). Then you choose which specific race &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would like to play; you have ten possibilities in all, drawing from a well-worn book of science-fiction tropes, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/04/from-squadron-to-wingleader&quot;&gt;angry cats in space&lt;/a&gt; to hive-mind-powered insects, from living rocks to pacifistic brainiacs, alongside the inevitable humans. Once you’ve made your choice, you’re cast into the deep end — or rather into deep space — with a single half-developed planet, a colony ship for settling a second planet as soon as you find a likely candidate, two unarmed scout ships for exploring for just such a candidate, and a minimal set of starting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_013/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4178&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4178&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_013-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_013-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_013-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_013.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must parlay these underwhelming tools into galactic domination hundreds of turns later. You can take the last part of the 4X tag literally and win out by utterly exterminating all of your rivals, but a slightly less genocidal approach is a victory in the “Galactic Council” which meets every quarter-century (i.e., every 25 turns). Here everyone can vote on which of the two most currently populous empires’ leaders they prefer to appoint as ruler of the galaxy, with “everyone” in this context including the two leading emperors themselves. Each empire gets a number of votes determined by its population, and the first to collect two-thirds of the total vote wins outright. (Well, almost… it is possible for you to refuse to respect the outcome of a vote that goes against you, but doing so will cause all of your rivals to declare immediate and perpetual war against you, whilst effectively pooling all of their own resources and technology. Good luck with that!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_010/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4179&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4179&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_010-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_010-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_010-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_010.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical game of &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; plays out over three broad stages. The first stage is the land grab, the wide-open exploration and colonization phase that happens before you meet your rival aliens. Here your challenge is to balance the economic development of your existing planets against your need to settle as many new ones as possible to put yourself in a good position for the mid-game. (&lt;em&gt;When exactly do I stop spending my home planet’s resources on improving its own infrastructure and start using them to build more colony ships?&lt;/em&gt;) The mid-game begins when you start to bump into your rivals, and comes to entail much jockeying for influence, as the various races begin to sort themselves into rival factions. (&lt;em&gt;The Alkaris, bird-like creatures, loathe the Mrrshans, the aforementioned race of frenzied pussycats, and their loathing is returned in kind. I don’t have strong feelings about either one — but whose side would it most behoove me to choose from a purely strategic perspective?&lt;/em&gt;) The end-game is nigh when the there is no more room for anyone to expand, apart from taking planets from a rival by force, and the once-expansive galaxy suddenly seems claustrophobic. It often, although by no means always, is marked by a massive war that finally secures somebody that elusive two-thirds majority in the Galactic Council. (&lt;em&gt;I’m so close now! Do I attack those stubbornly intractable Bulrathi to try to knock down their population and get myself over the two-thirds threshold that way, or do I keep trying to sweet-talk and bribe them into voting for me?&lt;/em&gt;) The length and character of all of these stages will of course greatly depend on the initial setup you chose; the first stage might be all but nonexistent in a small galaxy with five rivals, while it will go on for a long, long time indeed in a huge galaxy with just one or two oppoenents. (The former scenario is, for the record, far more challenging.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s how it goes, generally speaking. Yet the core genius of &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; actually lies in how resistant it is to generalization. It’s no exaggeration to say that there really is no “typical” game; I’ve enjoyed plenty which played out in nothing like the pattern I’ve just described for you. I’ve played games in which I never fired a single shot in anger, even ones where I’ve never built a single armed ship of war, just as I’ve played others where I was in a constant war for survival from beginning to end. &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; is gaming’s best box of chocolates; you never know what you’re going to get when you jump into a new galaxy. Everything about the design is engineered to keep you from falling back on patterns universally applicable to the “typical” game. It’s this quality, more so than any other, that makes &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; so consistently rewarding. If I was to be stranded on the proverbial desert island, I have a pretty good idea of at least one of the games I’d choose to take with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll return momentarily to the question of just how &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; manages to build so much variation into a fairly simple set of core rules. I think it might be instructive to do so, however, in comparison with another game, one I’ve already had occasion to mention several times in this article: &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’m so often at pains to point out, game design is, like any creative pursuit, a form of public dialog. Certainly &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; itself comes with a long list of antecedents, including most notably Walter Bright’s mainframe game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobygames.com/game/empire___&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Empire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Dani Bunten Berry’s PC game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2013/08/seven-cities-of-gold&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seven Cities of Gold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71/civilization&quot;&gt;Avalon Hill board game&lt;/a&gt; with which &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; shares its name. Likewise, &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; has its progeny, among them &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;. By no means was it the sole influence on the latter; as we’ve seen, &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; was also greatly influenced by the 4X space-opera tradition in board games, especially during its early phases of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the mark of &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; as well can be seen all over its finished design. (After all, Alan Emrich had just literally written the book on &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; when he started bombarding Barcia with design suggestions…) For example, &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, unlike all of its space-opera predecessors, on the computer or otherwise, doesn’t bother at all with multiplayer options, preferring to optimize the single-player experience in their stead. One can’t help but feel that it was &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;, which was likewise bereft of the multiplayer options that earlier grand-strategy games had always included as a matter of course, that empowered Steve Barcia and company to go this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, we cannot say that Jeff Johannigman was being particularly accurate when he took to calling &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; “&lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; in space” for the benefit of journalists. For all that it’s easy enough to understand what made such shorthand so tempting — this new project too was a grand-strategy game played on a huge scale, incorporating technology, economics, diplomacy, and military conflict — it wasn’t ultimately fair to either game. &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; is very much its own thing. Its interface, for example, is completely different. (Ironically, Barcia’s follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, the fantasy 4X &lt;em&gt;Master of Magic&lt;/em&gt;, hews much closer to &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; in that respect.) In &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;‘s influence often runs as much in a negative as a positive direction; that is to say, there are places where the later design is lifting ideas from the earlier one, but also taking it upon itself to correct perceived weaknesses in their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to use the qualifier “perceived” there because the two games have such different personalities. Simply put, &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; prioritizes its fictional context over its actual mechanics, while &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; does just the opposite. Together they illustrate the flexibility of the interactive digital medium, showing how great games can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; great in such markedly different ways, even when they’re as closely linked in terms of genre as these two are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; explicitly bills itself as a grand journey through human history, from the time in our distant past when the first hunter-gatherers settled down in villages to an optimistic near-future in space. The rules underpinning the journey are loose-goosey, full of potential exploits. The most infamous of these is undoubtedly the barbarian-horde strategy, in which you research only a few minimal technologies necessary for war-making and never attempt to evolve your society or participate in any meaningful diplomacy thereafter, but merely flood the world with miserable hardscrabble cities supporting primitive armies, attacking everything that moves until every other civilization is extinct. At the lower and moderate difficulty levels at least, this strategy works every single time, albeit whilst bypassing most of what the game was meant to be about. As put by Ralph Betza, a contributor to an early &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; strategy guide posted to Usenet: “You can always play Despotic Conquest, regardless of the world you find yourself starting with, and you can always win without using any of the many ways to cheat. When you choose any other strategy, you are deliberately risking a loss in order to make the game more interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So very much in &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; is of limited utility at best in purely mechanical terms. Many or most of the much-vaunted Wonders of the World, for example, really aren’t worth the cost you have to pay for them. But that’s okay; you pay for them anyway because you like the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of having built the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZC77LMK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07ZC77LMK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=analogantiqua-20&amp;amp;linkId=29ec905713365661a2dff57e3e54b570&quot;&gt;Pyramids of Giza&lt;/a&gt; or the Globe Theatre or Project Apollo, just as you choose not to go all Genghis Khan on the world because you’d rather build a civilization you can feel proud of. Perhaps the clearest statement of &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;‘s guiding design philosophy can be found in the manual. It says that, even if you make it all the way to the end of the game only to see one of your rivals achieve the ultimate goal of mounting an expedition to Alpha Centauri before you do, “the successful direction of your civilization through the centuries is an achievement. You have survived countless wars, the pollution of the industrial age, and the risks of nuclear weapons.” Or, as Sid Meier himself puts it, “a game of &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; is an epic &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4183&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_007/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4183&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4183&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4183&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_007-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_007-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_007-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_007.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4183&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;We’re happy to preach peace and cooperation, as long as we’re the top dogs… er, birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such sentiments are deeply foreign to &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;; this is a zero-sum game if ever there was one. If you lose the final Galactic Council vote, there’s no attaboy for getting this far, much less any consolation delivered that the galaxy has entered a new era of peaceful cooperation with some other race in the leadership role. Instead the closing cinematic tells you that you’ve left the known galaxy and “set forth to conquer new worlds, vowing to return and claim the renowned title of Master of Orion.” (Better to rule in Hell, right?) There are no Wonders of the World in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, and, while there is a tech tree to work through, you won’t find on it any of &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;‘s more humanistic advances, such as Chivalry or Mysticism, or even Communism or The Corporation. What you get instead are technologies — it’s telling that &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; talks about a “tech tree,” while &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; prefers the word “advances” — with a direct practical application to settling worlds and making war, divided into the STEM-centric categories of Computers, Construction, Force Fields, Planetology, Propulsion, and Weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; is the more idealistic, more educational, perhaps even the nobler of the two games. And yet it often plays a little awkwardly — which awkwardness we forgive because of its aspirational qualities. &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;‘s fictional context is a much thinner veneer to stretch over its mechanics, while words like “idealistic” simply don’t exist in its vocabulary. And yet, being without any high-flown themes to fall back on, it makes sure that its mechanics are absolutely &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt;. These dichotomies can create a dilemma for a critic like yours truly. If you asked me which game presents a better argument for gaming writ large as a potentially uplifting, ennobling pursuit, I know which of the two I’d have to point to. But then, when I’m just looking for a fun, challenging, intriguing &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; to play… well, let’s just say that I’ve played a lot more &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; over the last quarter-century. Indeed, &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; can easily be read as the work of a designer who looked at &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; and was unimpressed with its touchy-feely side, then set out to make a game that fixed all the other failings which that side obscured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of a first example, let’s consider the two games’ implementation of an advances chart — or a tech tree, whichever you prefer. Arguably the most transformative single advance in &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; is Railroads; they let you move your military units between your cities almost instantaneously, which makes attacks much easier and quicker to mount for warlike players and enables the more peaceful types to protect their holdings with a much smaller (and thus less expensive) standing army. The Railroads advance is so pivotal that some players build their entire strategy around acquiring it as soon as possible, by finding it on the advances chart as soon as the game begins in 4000 BC and working their way backward to find the absolute shortest path for reaching it. This is obviously problematic from a storytelling standpoint; it’s not as if the earliest villagers set about learning the craft of Pottery with an eye toward getting their hands on Railroads 6000 years later. More importantly, though, it’s damaging to the longevity of the game itself, in that it means that players can and will always employ that &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; Railroads strategy just as soon as they figure out what a winner it is. Here we stumble over one of the subtler but nonetheless significant axioms of game design: if you give players a hammer that works on every nail, many or most of them &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use it — and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; it — over and over again, even if it winds up decreasing their overall enjoyment. It’s for this reason that some players continue to use even the barbarian-horde strategy in &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;, boring though it is. Or, to take an outside example: how many designers of CRPGs have lovingly crafted dozens of spells with their own unique advantages and disadvantages, only to watch players burn up everything they encounter with a trusty Fireball?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, works hard at every turn to make such one-size-fits-all strategies impossible — and nowhere more so than in its tech tree. When a new game begins, each race is given a randomized selection of technologies that are &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; for it to research, constituting only about half of the total number of technologies in the game. Thus, while a technology roughly equivalent to &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;‘s Railroads does exist in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; — Star Gates — you don’t &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; if this or any other technology is actually available to you until you advance far enough up the tree to reach the spot where it ought to be. You can’t base your entire strategy around a predictable technology progression. While you can acquire technologies that didn’t make it into your tree by trading with other empires, bullying them into giving them to you, or attacking their planets and taking them, that’s a much more fraught, uncertain path to go down than doing the research yourself, one that requires a fair amount of seat-of-your-pants strategy in its own right. Any way you slice it, in other words, you have to &lt;em&gt;improvise&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4181&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_003/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4181&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4181&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4181&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_003-300x188.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_003-300x188.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_003.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4181&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;We’ve been lucky here in that Hydrogen Fuel Cells, the first range-extending technology and a fairly cheap one, is available in our tree. If it wasn’t, and if we didn’t have a lot of stars conveniently close by, we’d have to dedicate our entire empire to attaining a more advanced and thus more expensive range-extending technology, lest we be left behind in the initial land grab. But this would of course mean neglecting other aspects of our empire’s development. Trade-offs like this are a constant fact of life in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one clever design choice has repercussions for every other aspect of the game. Take, for instance, the endlessly fascinating game-within-a-game of designing your fleet of starships. If the tech tree was static, players would inevitably settle upon a small set of go-to designs that worked for their style of play. As it is, though, every new ship is a fresh balancing act, its equipment calibrated to maximize your side’s technological strengths and mitigate its weaknesses, while also taking into careful account the strengths and weaknesses of the foe you expect to use it against, about which you’ve hopefully been compiling information through your espionage network. Do you build a huge number of tiny, fast, maneuverable fighters, or do you build just a few lumbering galactic dreadnoughts? Or do you build something in between? There are no universally correct answers, just sets of changing circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_016/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4182&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4182&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_016-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_016-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_016-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_016.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of dynamism are the alien races you play and those you play against. The cultures in &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; have no intrinsic strengths and weaknesses, just sets of leader tendencies when played by the computer; for your part, you’re free to play the Mongols as pacifists, or for that matter the Russians as paragons of liberal democracy and global cooperation. But in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, each race’s unique affordances force you to play it differently. Likewise, each opposing race’s affordances in combination with those of your own force you to respond differently to that race when you encounter it, whether on the other side of a diplomats’ table or on a battlefield in space. Further, most races have one technology they’re unusually good at researching and one they’re unusually bad at. Throw in varying degrees of affinity and prejudice toward the other races, and, again, you’ve got an enormous amount of variation which defies cookie-cutter strategizing. (It’s worth noting that there’s a great deal of asymmetry here; Steve Barcia and his helpers didn’t share so many modern designers’ obsession with symmetrical play balance above all else. Some races are clearly more powerful than others: the brainiac Psilons get a huge research bonus, the insectoid Klackons get a huge bonus in worker productivity, and the Humans get huge bonuses in trade and diplomacy. Meanwhile the avian Alkaris, the feline Mrrshan, and the ursine Bulrathis have bonuses which only apply during combat, and can be overcome fairly easily by races with other, more all-encompassing advantages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are yet more touches to bring yet more dynamism. Random events occur from time to time in the galaxy, some of which can change everything at a stroke: a gigantic space amoeba might show up and start eating stars, forcing everyone to forget their petty squabbles for a while and band together against this apocalyptic threat. And then there’s the mysterious star Orion, from which the game takes it name, which houses the wonders of a long-dead alien culture from the mythical past. Taking possession of it might just win the game for you — but first you’ll have to defeat its almost inconceivably powerful Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the perennial problems of 4X games, &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; among them, is the long anticlimax, which begins at that point when you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you’re going to conquer the world or be the first to blast off for Alpha Centauri, but well before you actually do so. (What &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; player isn’t familiar with the delights of scouring the map for that one remaining rival city tucked away on some forgotten island in some forgotten corner?) Here too &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; comes with a mitigating idea, in the form of the Galactic Council whose workings I’ve already described. It means that, as soon as you can collect two-thirds of the vote — whether through wily diplomacy or the simpler expedient of conquering until two-thirds of the galaxy’s population is your own — the game ends and you get your victory screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of the overarching design themes of &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; is its determination to minimize the boring stuff. It must be admitted, of course, that boredom is in the eye of the beholder. Non-fans have occasionally dismissed the whole 4X space-opera sub-genre as “Microsoft Excel in space,” and &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; too requires a level of comfort with — or, better yet, a degree of fascination with — numbers and ratios; you’ll spend at least as much time tinkering with your economy as you will engaging in space battles. Yet the game does everything it can to minimize the pain here as well. While hardly a simple game in absolute terms, it is quite a streamlined example of its type; certainly it’s much less fiddly than &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;. Planet management is abstracted into a set of five sliding ratio bars, allowing you decide what percentage of that planet’s total output should be devoted to building ships, building defensive installations, building industrial infrastructure, cleaning up pollution, and researching new technologies. Unlike in &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;, there is no list of specialized structures to build one at a time, much less a need to laboriously develop the land square by square with a specialized unit. Some degree of micro-management is always going to be in the nature of this type of game, but managing dozens of planets in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; is far less painful than managing dozens of cities in &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_4180&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_015/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4180&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-4180&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-4180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_015-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_015-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_015-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_015.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-4180&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The research screen as well operates through sliding ratio bars which let you decide how much effort to devote to each of six categories of technology. In other words, you’re almost always researching multiple advances at once in &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, whereas in &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; you only research one at a time. Further, you can never predict for sure when a technology will arrive; while each has a base cost in research points, “paying” it leads only to a slowly increasing randomized chance of acquiring the technology on any given turn. (That’s the meaning of the “17%” next to Force Fields in the screenshot above.) You also receive bonuses for maintaining steady research over a long run of turns, rather than throwing all of your research points into one technology, then into something else, etc. All of this as well serves to make the game more unpredictable and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; tries really, really hard to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; you rather than against you, and succeeds to such a degree that it can sometimes feel like the game is reading your mind. A reductionist critic of the sort I can be on occasion might say that there are just two types of games: those that actually got played before their release and those that didn’t. With only rare exceptions, this distinction, more so than the intrinsic brilliance of the design team or any other factor, is the best predictor of the quality of the end result. &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; is clearly a game that got played, and played extensively, with all of the feedback thus gathered being incorporated into the final design. The interface is about as perfect as the technical limitations of 1993 allow it to be; nothing you can possibly want to do is more than two clicks away. And the game is replete with subtle little conveniences that you only come to appreciate with time — like, just to take one example, the way it asks if you want to automatically adjust the ecology spending on every one of your planets when you acquire a more efficient environmental-cleanup technology. This lived-in quality can only be acquired the honest, old-fashioned way: by giving your game to actual players and then listening to what they tell you about it, whether the points they bring up are big or small, game-breaking or trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2020/01/master-of-orion/orion_004/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-4184&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-4184&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_004-300x225.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_004-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_004-500x375.png 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/orion_004.png 640w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thoroughgoing commitment to quality is made all the more remarkable by our knowledge of circumstances inside MicroProse while &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; was going through these critical final phases of its development. When the contract to publish the game was signed, MicroProse was in desperate financial straits, having lost bundles on an ill-advised standup-arcade game along with expensive forays into adventure games and CRPGs, genres far from their traditional bread and butter of military simulations and grand-strategy games. Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2019/03/darklands&quot;&gt;other projects&lt;/a&gt; suffered badly from the chaos, &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps because it was a rather low-priority project entrusted largely to an outside team located over a thousand miles away, was given the time and space to become its best self. It was still a work in progress on June 21, 1993, when MicroProse’s mercurial, ofttimes erratic founder and CEO “Wild Bill” Stealey sold the company to Spectrum Holobyte, a publisher with a relatively small portfolio of extant games but a big roll of venture capital behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; thus became one of the first releases from the newly conjoined entity on October 1, 1993. Helped along by the evangelism of Alan Emrich and his pals at &lt;em&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/em&gt;, it did about as well as such a cerebral title, almost completely bereft of audiovisual bells and whistles, could possibly do in the new age of multimedia computing; it became the biggest strategy hit since &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;, and the biggest 4X space opera to that point, in any medium. Later computerized iterations on the concept, including its own sequels, doubtless sold more copies in absolute numbers, but the original &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; has gone on to become one of the truly seminal titles in gaming history, almost as much so as the original &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt;. It remains the game to which every new 4X space opera — and there have been many of them, far more than have tried to capture the more elusively idealistic appeal of &lt;em&gt;Civilization&lt;/em&gt; — must be compared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a status such as that enjoyed by &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; arrives thanks to an historical accident or a mere flashy technical innovation, but that is definitively not the case here. &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; remains as rewarding as ever in all its near-infinite variation. Personally, I like to embrace its dynamic spirit for everything it’s worth by throwing a (virtual) die to set up a new game, letting the Universe decide what size galaxy I play in, how many rivals I play with, and which race I play myself. The end result never fails to be enjoyable, whether it winds up a desperate free-for-all between six alien civilizations compressed into a tiny galaxy with just 24 stars, or a wide-open, stately game of peaceful exploration in a galaxy with over 100 of them. In short, &lt;em&gt;Master of Orion&lt;/em&gt; is the most inexhaustible well of entertainment I’ve ever found in the form of a single computer game — a timeless classic that never fails to punish you for playing lazy, but never fails to reward you for playing well. I’ve been pulling it out to try to conquer another random galaxy at least once every year or two for half my life already. I suspect I’ll still be doing so until the day I die.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How much longer will we trust Google’s search results?</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/24/21079696/google-serp-design-change-altavisa-ads-trust</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/24/21079696/google-serp-design-change-altavisa-ads-trust</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;1183996067&quot;&gt;Happy Friday to you! I have been reflecting a bit on the controversy du jour: Google’s redesigned search results. Google is trying to foreground sourcing and URLs, but in the process it made its results look more like ads, or vice versa. Bottom line: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/1/23/21078343/google-ad-desktop-design-change-favicon-icon-ftc-guidelines&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google’s ads just look like search results now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;h1fAGV&quot;&gt;I’m thinking about it because I have to admit that I don’t personally hate the new favicon -plus-URL structure. But I think that might be because I am not a normal consumer of web content. I’ve been on the web since the late ‘90s and I parse information out of URLs kind of without thinking about it. (In fact, the relative decline of valuable information getting encoded into the URL is a thing that makes me sad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;P7KnzX&quot;&gt;I admit that I am not a normal user. I set up custom &lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/questions/280694/how-can-i-share-my-google-chrome-search-engine-entries&quot;&gt;Chrome searches and export them&lt;/a&gt; to my other browsers. I know what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page&quot;&gt;SERP&lt;/a&gt; means and the term kind of slips out in regular conversation sometimes. I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18402628/google-amp-url-problem-signed-exchange-original-chrome-cloudflare&quot;&gt;opinions about AMP &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; its URL and caching structure&lt;/a&gt;. I’m a weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pAAmmb&quot;&gt;As that weirdo, Google’s design makes perfect sense and it’s possible it might do the same for regular folk. The new layout for search result is ugly at first glance — but then Google was always ugly until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution&quot;&gt;relatively recently&lt;/a&gt;. I very quickly learned to unconsciously take in the information from the top favicon and URL-esque info without it really distracting me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;SzsPMJ&quot;&gt;...Which is basically the problem. Google’s using that same design language to identify its ads instead of much more obvious, visually distinct methods. It’s consistent, I guess, but it also feels deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yOAHFC&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pkafka/status/1220378204227145729?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode’s&lt;/em&gt; Peter Kafka recently interviewed Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti&lt;/a&gt;, and Peretti said something really insightful: what if Google’s ads really aren’t that good? What if Google is just taking credit for clicks on ads just because people would have been searching for that stuff anyway? I’ve been thinking about it all day: what if Google ads actually aren’t that effective and the only reason they make so much is billions of people use Google?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oFgwy9&quot;&gt;The pressure to make them more effective would be fairly strong, then, wouldn’t it? And it would get increasingly hard to resist that pressure over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;12HO0m&quot;&gt;I am old enough to remember using the search engines before Google. I didn’t know how bad their search technology was compared to what was to come, but I did have to bounce between several of them to find what I wanted. Knowing what was a good search for WebCrawler and what was good for Yahoo was one of my Power User Of The Internet skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GV8sqs&quot;&gt;So when Google hit, I didn’t realize how powerful and good the PageRank technology was right away. What I noticed right away is that I could trust the search results to be “organic” instead of paid and that there were no dark patterns tricking me into clicking on an ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pP5j2H&quot;&gt;One of the reasons Google won search in the first place with old people like me was that in addition to its superior technology, it drew a harder line against allowing paid advertisements into its search results than its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Tyg1O8&quot;&gt;With other search engines, there was the problem of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_inclusion&quot;&gt;paid inclusion&lt;/a&gt;,” which is the rare business practice that does exactly what the phrase means. You never really knew if what you were seeing was the result of a web-crawling bot or a business deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AEtGgN&quot;&gt;This new ad layout doesn’t cross that line, but it’s definitely problematic and it definitely reduces my trust in Google’s results. It’s not so much paid inclusion as paid &lt;em&gt;occlusion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WjIyzz&quot;&gt;Today, I still trust Google to not allow business dealings to affect the rankings of its organic results, but how much does that matter if most people can’t visually tell the difference at first glance? And how much does that matter when certain sections of Google, like hotels and flights, do use paid inclusion? And how much does that matter when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10858728/internet-bundle-siri-alexa-google-now-cortana-bots&quot;&gt;business dealings very likely do affect the outcome&lt;/a&gt; of what you get when you use the next generation of search, the Google Assistant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rbWmYH&quot;&gt;And most of all: if Google is willing to visually muddle ads, how long until its users lose trust in the algorithm itself? With this change, Google is becoming what it once sought to overcome: AltaVista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;yNtl76&quot;&gt;Excellent review from Natt Garun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qmW9ZJ&quot;&gt;Tonal is unique in this field for its focus on weight training instead of cardio. Think of the machine like a slimmer, low-profile Bowflex that mounts flush against the wall rather than taking up an entire corner of your room. With arms that can be adjusted and folded away, it’s also a bit less likely to end up as an expensive coat rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;i4dqJP&quot;&gt;Every year Google does a little online game or coding challenge and every year it’s solved really quickly. This year Google leaned into that and it seems to have worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mx7UfD&quot;&gt;It’s a little too early for me to guess what we can expect at I/O this year. Google itself often doesn’t decide until the last minute. Given everything that’s happened in the past year, though, I’l say this: if the entire keynote was just a frank discussion of Google’s privacy policies and how it intends to be more transparent about what data is has on us and how we can control it, I wouldn’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;IbYU2S&quot;&gt;If this turns out to be true, it’s a huge deal. And it will be a huge problem for Motorola, whose Razr will only have been on the market for five days when Samsung announces the Z Flip on the 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Cqg3Oz&quot;&gt;Maybe it’s just because it’s a new form factor, but I’m getting more and more excited about folding phones. For years we’ve watched phones get bigger and less pocketable and for whatever reason (the reason is probably that they don’t sell well), nobody is making high-quality &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; phones anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EQSxRC&quot;&gt;Foldables aren’t exactly that, but they’re at least heading in the right direction. I will gladly take a little more thickness on the Z axis (maybe THAT is why it’s called the Z Flip!) if it means having a big-screen phone that doesn’t stick out of my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;coZdFd&quot;&gt;It’s notable that nothing actually changed here policy-wise: Sonos is still going to try to support these speakers, it is still admitting it won’t be able to provide software updates, and it will still try to figure out a way to cordon these legacy products off so they don’t hold newer products back in people’s home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bBajGQ&quot;&gt;Okay, one very important thing has changed: Sonos admitted it really screwed up the communication around these changes. It’s been a mess since the recycling mode first came to light. You can’t unring a bell, but it’s at least good to admit you screwed up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lumen Project is an alternative implementation of the Erlang VM, more known as the BEAM. It is designed to work in WebAssembly with the specific goal of bringing Elixir and Erlang to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Lumen is &lt;em&gt;still a pre-release&lt;/em&gt; set of tools.&lt;/em&gt; Don't expect anything to work. Don't expect any special features. It is moving steadily beyond proofs of concept and prototypes. But it is not a complete solution or full-fledged experience yet. If you want to know more about the details I really recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMgTIlgYB-U&quot;&gt;announcement keynote from ElixirConf 2019&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube at the link, embed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMgTIlgYB-U&quot; width=&quot;625&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not prime-time yet.&lt;/strong&gt; With that disclaimer out of the way. The crew that is doing this work have been put together and funded by DockYard. That company is apparently hell-bent on making sure Elixir has enough cool projects to keep this blog running indefinitely. Much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lumen team is working with the BEAM as their reference implementation, so while this is an alternate implementation that will differ in some details I don't expect this to be a split of the community efforts in any noticeable or detrimental way. As for my part in this, I'm just enthusiastic about it and I'm at most a community contributor. I'm not involved or paid beyond my own interest. If someone wants to pay me to work on Lumen in any capacity, I probably would. But that's not the case so the unbridled enthusiasm is my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-illuminated&quot;&gt;The future, illuminated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I think it means? Well. Phoenix LiveView provides one way of minimizing the amount of JS we as developers have to write and allow us to potentially focus on the application and let the harsh separation of frontend and backend fade into the background. Ideally. But if you have an application where the UI is highly interactive LiveView might not be the ideal solution. Server roundtrips can make it untenable, you might have specific needs that concern some web APIs. This is one case where I can see Lumen step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Cardarella (of DockYard) has touched on Javascript development being a fairly significant timesink in client projects compared to what it has been in the past. I don't think of this as a big push for isometric applications in Elixir. But it would allow some of that. I think of it as being able to build the web-equivalent of the Scenic framework for web UI. Native web UI elements with the resilience of a supervision tree. Functional principles, not just tacked on in a prototype OOP whatever-JS-is-these-days. It also means that we can have a single project where some things are compiled to the frontend with Lumen and the backend runs on the battle-tested BEAM. I think we can discover ways in which OTP principles allow us to create new and useful web frameworks. And for those of us who enjoy Elixir or Erlang, we can work in our language with paradigms we enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside. I'm trying not to bash on Javascript because the community gets enough flack and that's not what this is about for me. JS and its ecosystem is not my preference and I have a hard time getting excited about JS as the future. I write things in JS and I don't overly complain, I'm a professional, not a baby. I also don't hold it against anyone if JS is their jam. That's fine. Back to Lumen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the trade-offs of Lumen? Well, WebAssembly is still fairly fresh. The whole bindings thing between WebAssembly and Javascript is still early last I heard. So battle-tested it ain't. I think the Lumen team is taking a thoughtful and healthy approach to avoiding unnecessary bloat on the client. However, I think it will still be a bit on the heavier side compared to straight JS or something that is only Rust -&amp;gt; WebAssembly. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trade-off is that we are leaving behind the years of proven reliability of the BEAM. Lumen should provide the same potential to build resilient systems. But it won't have the raw history of time in production of the mainline BEAM. So that's a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are they doing to make this feasible for web frontend dev? Well, as it stands Lumen provides modules that allow interaction from BEAM languages to the DOM, they are basic right now but the principles seems sound. Size is kept down by instead of providing a (big honking) VM that runs BEAM bytecode they are compiling whatever parts of the runtime are actually needed and only those. Essentially it compiles everything ahead of time and strips out anything you don't need that is in the Erlang or Elixir standard libraries. This kills hot code pluggability but seems entirely worthwhile. So it all compiles through LLVM with a combination of BEAM languages and Rust into a WebAssembly result that you can run in the browser. This is based off of what I've read, heard and seen but I reserve the right to be wrong about the details. I haven't gone deep enough to know first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser is a powerful runtime and that's how a lot of web apps use it. I think the Rust WebAssembly efforts do a lot to empower us developers to start considering non-JS options. I'll happily use JS in the future for things big and small. I just don't love the language and its not my preference. And in the long term, having things like Lumen will make the web a more powerful platform. There are also a lot of new tech that is targeting WebAssembly as a new common language, I think Lumen may end up having surprising potential in environments where the BEAM is a bit big or full ahead-of-time compilation makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-it-yourself&quot;&gt;Try it yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Lumen is &lt;em&gt;still a pre-release&lt;/em&gt; set of tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can you try this bleeding-edge technology? Yes. I did. And then I hassled #lumen on Slack until I was content that there was something I could show that would be the correct level of interesting and exciting. So now I can share a fairly straight-forward approach to getting started with Lumen. It ends up running the interpreter in the browser rather than the process outlined above which would be compiling everything down to WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Pull Request for the Lumen project as I just updated one of their examples to try making it more complete. You can find my branch and the relevant example &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lawik/lumen/tree/interpreter-demo-updates/examples/interpreter-in-browser&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and try it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets walk through it. Lumen is built in Rust and if you want to help them with development you can follow the README at the root of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lumen/lumen&quot;&gt;their repo&lt;/a&gt; to get a proper project setup. But to simplify, here come the compressed install instructions for MacOS. Start out with cloning the project git repo &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lawik/lumen&quot;&gt;from my GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, checkout the `interpreter-demo-updates` branch. We are using my branch because the PR is still in flight. I'll try to update this when it has been merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;shell-commands&quot; data-file=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
git clone https://github.com/lawik/lumen
cd lumen
git checkout interpreter-demo-updates
cd examples/interpreter-in-browser
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up the basics you need for running the Rust stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;shell-commands&quot; data-file=&quot;/lumen/examples/interpreter-in-browser&quot;&gt;
# If you have rust installed through homebrew,
# you may need to uninstall it
brew uninstall rust
# Install rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Activate the environment to not have to restart the terminal
source ~/.cargo/env
rustup default nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
cargo +nightly install wasm-bindgen-cli
# Install wasm-pack
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Build the example
wasm-pack build

# Link the packages
pushd www
npm install
popd

pushd pkg
npm link
popd

pushd www
npm link interpreter-in-browser
popd


&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;shell-commands&quot; data-file=&quot;/lumen/examples/interpreter-in-browser&quot;&gt;
cd www
npm run start
open http://localhost:8080 
# Or just open the browser to that address ;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try your hand at sending new code to the interpreter, just edit the Erlang code in &lt;code&gt;www/ex_sample.erl&lt;/code&gt; and it should reload (or you refresh by hand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote some instructions for compiling Elixir code to Erlang code and using it with the interpreter, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lawik/lumen/tree/interpreter-demo-updates/examples/interpreter-in-browser#compiling-from-elixir-to-erlang&quot;&gt;follow them here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in contributing to Lumen the team has been helpful in the #lumen Slack channel on the normal Elixir Slack and they've asked for help getting all the BIFs implemented previously. So I'm sure they'll help an enthusiastic contributor find their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the future looks bright. I'm very hopeful and optimistic about what Lumen might achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I screwed up some piece of the instructions, have an entirely inaccurate take on something or even better you have something positive to add I'm available at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:lars@underjord.io&quot;&gt;lars@underjord.io&lt;/a&gt; or on Twitter where I'm &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lawik&quot;&gt;@lawik&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;following&quot; readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;newsletter&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write a newsletter, if you want to know what I've been posting and potentially have some additional writing delivered directly to you. Then sign-up. Otherwise, skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Campaign Monitor and do my best to strangle the tracking-features out of it. The form does use an arbitrary bit of JS for the sign-up that I know little about. I've set this up so you will be flagged for no tracking. We are in the EU, work along the GDPR and tracking user data is a liability that I prefer to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</description>

<title>We Wasted $50K on Google Ads So You Don&amp;#039;t Have To (2019)</title>
<link>https://www.indiehackers.com/article/we-wasted-50k-on-google-ads-so-you-dont-have-to-355a425b27</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.indiehackers.com/article/we-wasted-50k-on-google-ads-so-you-dont-have-to-355a425b27</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;A piece of an awareness ladder we used to structure the campaign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table above represents the first two steps of the awareness ladder snapshot for “File Upload PHP.” Before getting to the next article section, note the two important things: we tried creating a landing page that would serve as jack-of-all-trades; we looked at the Sign-Up -&amp;gt; Activated conversion as one of our target metrics. Leaping ahead, that was a bad decision: it is a far-off metric to look at since it takes users way more time to activate within a product than click a banner or even sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we’re talking about startups or PPC campaigns, execution really is everything. No brilliant idea or rock-solid plan is going to implement itself. So while our planning was A-OK, things fell apart due to a few key details. Here are some more lessons we learned…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #1: Test and trim keywords sets before hiring an agency to scale things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to work with an SEM agency to simultaneously launch a whole bunch of Google Ad campaigns. That proved to be costly since agencies typically start with your extended keyword set and optimize the budget over time by narrowing things down and excluding inefficient keywords from the campaigns. Instead, we should have taken a test-and-learn approach internally with small budgets to weed out inefficient keywords before handing things off to an agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget: we looked at users signing up and activating before making a final decision on this or that campaign quality. Every hour spent waiting for folks to sign up and activate meant losing money on expensive clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #2: Focus on page quality and CTR when doing paid tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ideal testing metrics for paid campaigns are &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2454010&quot;&gt;landing page quality&lt;/a&gt; and clickthrough rate (CTR). Why? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wordstream.com/quality-score&quot;&gt;Optimizing your Quality Score&lt;/a&gt; lowers your cost per click (CPC) and cost per conversion, and CTR is the most important component of Quality Score. Not to mention that measuring CTR and landing page quality is way faster than waiting for conversions to happen within your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach means you need to create that on-page content first because you can't really test landing page quality any other way. Sure, you could run paid tests on the quality of your competitors’ pages to see what works before you create your own. But you’ll still need to run tests on your own landing pages to optimize for CTR on your domain, because Quality Score factors in your historical Google Ads performance, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you establish baseline page quality scores for your content, you can further optimize your landing pages by &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/features/&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; a few different content hypotheses to see what will boost the Quality Score. Once you’re happy with the quality and CTR metrics, you’re ready to ramp up your spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #3: Stick to keywords that you have landing pages and content for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the get-go, we should have axed keywords for which we had no landing pages or content, since “orphan” keywords that don’t have a home in your page content won’t yield great CTRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreso, you should have at least a single landing page for every other step of your awareness ladder. We have already told you about our jack-of-all-trades landing: even though we thought it had content for everybody, it was best suited to the third level of our ladder; see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WPkrrxCutaHA_lDqjui6IsUo65UmFiP05XMtCf_tvbY/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;. We got it when we figured that cost-per-lead was ten times below the baseline for a specific subset of keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segment your extended keyword set according to the actual content you already have. Some of those existing pages can serve as landing pages, depending on how optimized they are for conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set aside keyword groups that aren’t well represented on your site. For example, although our solution is a good fit for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.uploadcare.com/accelerate-your-images-by-9x-with-image-cdn-6b63aa27e639&quot;&gt;mobile platforms&lt;/a&gt;, there was no dedicated landing page content to demonstrate this to site visitors. Until we have that in place, mobile-oriented keywords are best put on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #4: Don’t assume organic conversion rate will hold true for paid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember those conversion rates from earlier? For paid options, one would assume they would be equal to, or better than, non-paid traffic because people show intent when they click on an ad, right? Well, that did not turn out to be the case, not even close. Conversation rates from paid campaigns were significantly lower than the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason? Our old nemesis, Quality Score. Specifically, low landing page quality for existing campaigns. Even with a decent clickthrough rate, poor page quality meant a cost-per-click of about $0.97 and a customer acquisition cost way above one-third of customer lifetime value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the suboptimal conversion rate was scaling the quality failure: regardless of how much we would spend, we’d only get losses in return. And because the paid conversion rates were so far off our baseline rates, we wasted even more time and money on making decisions about the quality of inbound traffic for the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #5: Analytics will save (some of) your bacon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bad as things were, they could have been much worse. Without analytics in place, we wouldn't have had a clue about what campaign leads did on our site and which elements they interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you’ll want to be sure your analytics are fully optimized with reporting configured to suit your needs before you throw paid traffic into the mix. If you don’t spot something with organic traffic, it’s just a missed opportunity. With paid, the first thing you may notice is your spend spiking, at which point the damage is already done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lesson #6: Revisit your awareness ladder often to validate and update it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got deeper into our campaign, it became clear that our awareness ladder was structured wrong. Here are the two main issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyword groupings we associated with each step were irrelevant because they weren’t in line with how people would perform their searches. We figured we had to shift our keywords sets one step down (the example awareness ladder in this article already comes with the fix). I.e., folks are already aware of the problems and search for a solution in form of a library or service. So, there are two branches of competition: “library vs. DIY” and “library vs. library.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content. We believed that a single landing page could work well for different steps of the ladder. That’s fundamentally wrong, and our tests (see below) showed the landing page better suits the L3 of Awareness Ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, any awareness ladder is a dynamic concept that you’ll want to revisit and optimize based on campaign insights, or even restructure completely from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$50K of lessons learned, summarized for you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap our lessons learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Narrow down your extended keyword set and focus on the keyword groups you have polished content and landing pages for, especially when you have a complex product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an awareness ladder to inform keyword segmentation by purchase stage but revisit it often to validate and adjust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use the same landing pages for different steps of your awareness ladder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not wait for leads to become paid users to decide on the quality of paid ads campaigns: focus on quick metrics and tailor experiments to one step of your funnel at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a test-and-learn approach with small budgets to quickly fine-tune campaigns, focusing on page quality and clickthrough rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run tests to optimize page content, which will reduce your cost per click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you find your winner, you’re ready to go all-in. Now’s the time to pass it off to an agency to scale things up, if you are contracting out campaign management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, we dialed down our spend and did a series of quick paid tests, which helped us boost ad results to three times our baseline conversion rate. Specifically, we figured our content works best for the L3 of the Awareness Ladder. The landing page was better structured to help folks that were already aware of the problem and existing solutions and would look for a ready-made plugin (i.e. “image upload plugin” or “jQuery image upload”). Take a look at the Search Ads examples below.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rolls-Royce plans mini nuclear reactors by 2029</title>

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Mini nuclear reactors could be generating power in the UK by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturer Rolls-Royce has told the BBC's Today programme that it plans to install and operate factory-built power stations by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini nuclear stations can be mass manufactured and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35863846&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;delivered in chunks&lt;/a&gt; on the back of a lorry, which makes costs more predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But opponents say the UK should quit nuclear power altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the country should concentrate on cheaper renewable energy instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists are divided over nuclear power, with some maintaining it is dangerous and expensive, while others say that to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 all technologies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the industry is confident that mini reactors can compete on price with low-cost renewables such as offshore wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolls-Royce is leading a consortium to build small modular reactors (SMRs) and install them in former nuclear sites in Cumbria or in Wales. Ultimately, the company thinks it will build between 10 and 15 of the stations in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are about 1.5 acres in size - sitting in a 10-acre space. That is a 16th of the size of a major power station such as Hinkley Point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMRs are so small that theoretically every town could have its own reactor - but using existing sites avoids the huge problem of how to secure them against terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Who wants to play the status game?</title>
<link>https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/who-wants-to-play-the-status-game-agnes-callard/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/who-wants-to-play-the-status-game-agnes-callard/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the twelfth in a series of columns on public philosophy by Agnes Callard; read &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20190820202235/https://thepointmag.com/author/acallard&quot;&gt;more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first meet someone, you “feel each other out” to see where your lives might connect—where are you from, what do you do, what music/art/books do you like, etc. You are looking for common ground on the basis of which your conversation might proceed. Call this the Basic Game; I’d like to contrast it with two more advanced games that can be played in its stead, or alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Importance Game, participants jockey for position. This usually works by way of casual references to wealth, talent, accomplishment or connections, but there are many variants. I can, for instance, play this game by pretending to eschew it: “Let’s get straight down to business” can telegraph my being much too important to waste time with such games; or your being so unimportant as to render the game otiose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other game is the Leveling Game, and it uses empathy to equalize the players. So I might performatively share feelings of stress, inadequacy or weakness; or express discontent with the Powers that Be; or home in on a source of communal outrage, frustration or oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A player of the Importance Game tries to ascend high enough to reach for something that will set her above her interlocutor, a player of the Leveling Game reaches down low enough to hit common ground. The former needs to signal enough power to establish a hierarchy; the latter enough powerlessness to establish equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advanced games really are advanced, in the sense of being harder to play than the Basic Game. This is due to the fact that one must, while playing them, also pretend not to be playing them. It is not okay to approach a new acquaintance with: “Let us set up a contest to figure out which of the two of us is smarter.” Nor would it be reasonable for me to say to my colleague: “How the administration oppresses us! Let us unite in self-pity.” Or to an undergraduate who enters my office: “Let me tell you how overwhelmed I am, that will put us on equal footing.” (“Stars: they’re just like us!”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players of the Basic Game are permitted to come pretty close to explicitly saying “Let us see what places/people/interests we have in common.” With the other two games this kind of explicitness itself violates one of the rules of the game. Call this “The Self-Effacing Rule.” Why does this rule apply to the advanced games, but not the Basic Game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ●&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In James Boswell’s &lt;em&gt;Life Of Johnson&lt;/em&gt;, Samuel Johnson often speaks in defense of a rigid social class system as the key to social order, because it creates a shared public knowledge of where everyone stands. There is a certain sense in this. A recent acquaintance told me that the least stressful new interactions in his life were in the army, because status relations were immediately evident and common knowledge—you just looked at how many stripes the person had on his shoulder and that was that, status negotiations complete. By contrast, in the extramilitary world, confusion reigns: billionaires wear hoodies, it is high-status to pretend you are low-status and no one is sure who exactly “the elite” refers to. The ensuing condition of generalized status-panic would be Johnson’s worst nightmare. He would be quick to point out that eliminating the obvious markers of status is hardly the same as eliminating status altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When status must be renegotiated in every interaction with strangers, people end up spending a lot of time asking and being asked the question “Just who do you think you are?” The mystery is why we feel required to pretend that this is not what we are doing. Again, what explains the Self-Effacing Rule?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am much more sure of the significance of this question than I am of the answer to it; the rest of this column will constitute my best attempt at one. Let me begin with the observation that either game in its pure form—“I am so important”; “I am nobody special”—feels heavy-handed and dull. The most adroit players are always finding new ways to mix it up, so the successful lighten their self-importance by emphasizing the struggles they face or their humble origins; likewise, you can add zest to the Leveling Game by finding ways to turn empathy into a status battleground. This is what the game of competitive wokeness is all about. In an academic context, I’ve noticed that complaining about how busy one is hits a sweet spot of oppression—I cannot manage my life!—and importance—because I am so in demand! When you’re playing with a master, it can be hard to tell which game you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be less interested in either of these games than in exploring the connection between them—or rather, the philosophical question to which that connection points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ●&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes you valuable? One answer is: the fact that you are a person. This way of answering rests on the thought that all people are equally worthy: value is something you get for free, by being a certain kind of creature. Another way to answer would be to talk about value that you (in particular, as opposed to others) have acquired for yourself. You have exercised your agency, choice and capacities in such a way as to make yourself (especially) valuable. These two answers point us to two very different conceptions of what it means to speak of the fundamental worth of a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might think we can steer these ideas out of the way of one another by allotting to one or the other a slightly more fundamental place—sometimes the political right is characterized as the party of competitive striving, and the left as the party of equality and dignity. But the right is also the party of populism and middle America; and the left of the coastal academic and cultural elites—the non-“deplorables.” Neither of our ideas of worth—the intrinsic and the earned—allows itself to be denied or subordinated for long; ignore it, and it bubbles back up in some other form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In philosophy we tend to find one of the two ideas foregrounded, the other squeezed in as an afterthought. So Kant holds that being capable of rational agency gives you dignity—it makes you an incomparable source of moral worth, irrespective of anything else that might be true of you. He does, at one point, acknowledge an (imperfect!) duty to cultivate one’s talents, but there is no suggestion that talent or its development plays much of a role in Kant’s answer to the question of “what makes a human being valuable.” Hence Nietzsche savages Kant (and other Enlightenment thinkers) for promoting a “herd morality” that glorifies mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Aristotle the ethical project is squarely one of cultivating superior excellence. He sees human political organization as fundamentally hierarchical, such that the highest virtue in the practical domain—wisdom (phronesis)—can be had only by the ruler. Another virtue, greatness of soul (megalopsychia), consists in being properly appreciative of how much better one is than other people. The occasional nod to equality—for instance, when Aristotle grants that in a criminal proceeding a judge should treat the parties as equals: “it makes no difference whether a good man has defrauded a bad man or a bad man a good one”—only underscores how unequal the overall story is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ●&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to mock others for engaging in the Importance Game and the Leveling Game than to acknowledge one is doing it. Jockeying for position and fishing for empathy offer up such twisted, ugly versions of the philosophical ideas of virtue and equality that we could not stand to engage in them for long, were we not shielding our eyes from what we are doing. And that, I think, is what ultimately explains the Self-Effacing Rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a philosophical conundrum at the root of all this: morality requires we maintain a safety net at the bottom that catches everyone—the alternative is simply inhumane—but we also need an aspirational target at the top, so as to inspire us to excellence, creativity and accomplishment. In other words, we need worth to come for free, and we also need it to be acquirable. And no philosopher—not Kant, not Aristotle, not Nietzsche, not I—has yet figured out how to construct a moral theory that allows us to say both of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a giant unsolved problem, and it touches us all. We may not explicitly articulate it, but we feel it, and project the psychic turmoil it generates onto our interactions with one another: there is a hierarchy, one of us is more valuable—no, no, no, hierarchy is evil, everyone is equally valuable; I want to be at the top—no, no, no, I’m perfectly comfortable wherever you are. In my view, there is a philosophical counterpart to Freud’s psychoanalytic thesis that we repetitively “act out” traumatic events we cannot process, namely that we “act out” conceptual problems we cannot solve. A person who cannot see to the bottom of her own ideas becomes a vehicle for the transmission of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status-mongering is the mess that results from leaving some of our ethical theorizing undone. We don’t know who we think we are, and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Issue 21 of&lt;/em&gt; The Point &lt;em&gt;is coming soon; check out our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepointmag.com/general/issue-21/&quot;&gt;annotated table of contents&lt;/a&gt; for a sneak peek.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Building a walkie-talkie for remote work</title>
<link>https://pragli.com/blog/building-a-walkie-talkie-for-remote-work/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pragli.com/blog/building-a-walkie-talkie-for-remote-work/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pragli is a virtual office for remote teams. One of its key features is quick, synchronous audio/video communication between teammates. This helps teammates communicate faster and build closeness and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragli's A/V communication is inspired by a walkie-talkie, rather than a phone call. In this article, I'll explain why we chose walkie-talkie and how we made it work well in Pragli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;benefits-of-walkie-talkie-vs-a-phone-call&quot;&gt;Benefits of walkie-talkie vs a phone call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkie-talkie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;: the sender gets a chance to explain why they are calling before the other side chooses whether or not to respond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt;: walkie-talkies are fast because there's no waiting for an accept to start speaking; calls take longer to get to the first word out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success in high pressure scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;: walkie-talkies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkie-talkie&quot;&gt;first used during WWII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/In-disaster-prone-California-emergency-sirens-14938016.php&quot;&gt;continue to be used in emergency scenarios&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in higher-tech radio or satellite formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pragli.com/blog/content/images/2020/01/wt.jpg&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;A walkie-talkie demo in 1942 by the US military
&lt;p&gt;Phone call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;: click-to-send is annoying for long conversations; people don't want to press a button every time they speak in longer interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Distracting&lt;/strong&gt;: with a walkie-talkie, you have to hear the person out - with a phone call, you can deny before they say anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comes naturally&lt;/strong&gt;: phones are more common and prevalent than walkie-talkies, so people are more used to phone call analogies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We designed Pragli to facilitate quick, meaningful conversations, so the context and speed of a walkie-talkie felt right to us. But how could we make walkie-talkie interactions scale, reduce distraction, and feel natural?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-1-talk-first-accept-later&quot;&gt;Version 1: Talk first, accept later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, we considered a pseudo-voicemail system. The &quot;caller&quot; would send a voice message to the &quot;receiver,&quot; who would then choose whether or not to accept the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solved the issue of scalability - once the conversation was accepted, it essentially became a call. However, it didn't reduce distraction and didn't feel natural. Also, it felt slower, since the voicemail wasn't a synchronous call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-2-mute-by-default&quot;&gt;Version 2: Mute-by-default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We refined our design by moving to an opt-out design rather than opt-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caller starts a conversation with the receiver. The receiver is muted by default to protect their privacy, while the caller starts talking immediately. The receiver unmutes themselves to start speaking, or they leave the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://pragli.com/blog/content/images/2020/01/start.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This maximizes the walkie-talkie benefits. The caller &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt; speaks and provides &lt;strong&gt;context&lt;/strong&gt; on the subject matter at hand. It also &lt;strong&gt;scales&lt;/strong&gt; well, as it turns into a call once the receiver unmutes themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;feels natural&lt;/strong&gt; for the caller, since they just click on someone to start talking with them. However, it sometimes feels very abrupt for the receiver when they are either a) having another meeting or b) focussing on deep work. In other words, it is still &lt;strong&gt;distracting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we were onto something good, since the interactions felt so much more natural and quick than before. But we needed to do more to make it feel less distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;solving-distraction-presence-statuses-calendar&quot;&gt;Solving Distraction: Presence + Statuses + Calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to solving distraction was to add additional context on whether the person was open to receiving a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, we added two forms of presence detection to show whether or not the person was at their desk. That way, the caller knows beforehand that they are unlikely to reach the person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Then, we added manual statuses. Statuses allow users to say that they're &quot;out for a walk,&quot; &quot;in another meeting,&quot; or simply &quot;focussing - do not disturb.&quot;&lt;p&gt;Manual statuses work great when users remembered to use them. But it feels heavyweight to constantly set your status. Users frequently forget to actually set them, leading to distracting interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we added Google and Outlook calendar integrations to automatically set status. Calendars record most meetings, personal events like dentist appointments, and increasingly dedicated &quot;focus time.&quot; Once the calendar is integrated, Pragli automatically warns away callers during events. This solves most of the issues with manual statuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pragli.com/blog/content/images/2020/01/cal-wt.gif&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Pragli supported all of this functionality, our walkie-talkie implementation felt a lot less distracting. People were connecting in a way that wasn't disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragli's walkie-talkie implementation provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt;: click on someone to start a conversation, and you can immediately speak with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;: no more wondering &quot;What are they calling me about?&quot; - the caller speaks immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;: the receiver is muted by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;: turns into a call, and therefore scales into longer conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intuitiveness&lt;/strong&gt;: it's not quite as intuitive as a phone call for some users, but it's obvious how to start a conversation and users pretty quickly learn the nuances of it. We still have some more work to do here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Distraction&lt;/strong&gt;: users can now automatically (via calendar) or manually prevent distraction and presence detection. We will continue to add more social signals to further lower distraction.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;post-nav-excerpt&quot;&gt;It was obvious that we needed to do something. Our users were getting increasingly annoyed at the bugs that were constantly popping up. We were moving fast and shipping a lot of features - but in the process, also breaking things.…&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Building a walkie-talkie for remote work</og:title>
<og:description>Pragli's A/V communication is inspired by a walkie-talkie, rather than a phone call. In this article, I'll explain why we chose a walkie-talkie, some hiccups we ran into when implementing a walkie-talkie, and how it ended up looking in Pragli.</og:description>

<title>Wikipedia now has more than 6M articles in English</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;wikipedia&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has surpassed a notable milestone today: The English version of the world’s largest online encyclopedia now has more than six million articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feat, which comes roughly 19 years after the website was founded, is a testament of “what humans can do together,” said Ryan Merkley, chief of staff at Wikimedia, the nonprofit organization that operates the omnipresent online encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6 millionth article is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Elise_Turner_Lauder&quot;&gt;Maria Elise Turner Lauder&lt;/a&gt;, a 19th-century Canadian school teacher, travel writer and fiction writer. The article was written by Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight, a longtime editor of Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is available in dozens of languages, but its English-language version has the most number of articles. Following the English edition, which hit 5 million articles in late 2015, are the German version, with about 2.3 million articles, and the French version, which has about 2.1 million articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The English edition is also the most visited project on the website. According to publicly disclosed figures, the English version of the website averages about 255 million pageviews a day. According to web analytics firm SimilarWeb, Wikipedia overall is the eighth most visited website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Wikipedia has conducted seminars in many nations to encourage more people to become contributors in their own local languages, and has also improved its tools to make it easier for them to write, publish and cite items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jimmy Wales founded Wikipedia, he said his goal was to provide “free access to the sum of all human knowledge.” According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Emijrp/All_Human_Knowledge&quot;&gt;one estimate&lt;/a&gt;, the sum of human knowledge would require 104 million articles — and we will need 20 more years to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
