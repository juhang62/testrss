<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a surprising turn of events, Apple has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cancelled its long-awaited AirPower wireless charging mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The company says the product didn’t meet its “high standards,” but wasn’t specific as to why. We’ve been watching this space carefully and have an informed guess as to what happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AirPower was first introduced to the public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/12/apple-airpower-wireless-charging/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;in September of 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;during Apple’s iPhone X reveal. The company promised a single wireless charging mat that could charge three devices at the same time, like your iPhone, Apple Watch, and your AirPods (the last of which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+2+Teardown/121471&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;got wireless charging capabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple planned on releasing AirPower the year after the iPhone X, in 2018. However, it was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/apples-airpower-charging-mat-delayed-until-fall-due-to-technical-hurdles/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reportedly hit with numerous delays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And as 2018 dragged on, the speculation of its cancellation loomed large, especially after Apple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-scrubs-most-references-to-airpower-from-its-website/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;completely wiped its website clean of any mention of the product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a full year after its announcement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting in 2019, though, a glimmer of hope emerged:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chargerlab/status/1083952811887357952&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rumors surfaced that AirPower’s production was ramping up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, pointing to the possibility that this product would finally be close to shipping. So close, in fact, that an iOS 12.2 beta—released just ten days before the AirPower’s cancellation—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/19/latest-ios-12-2-beta-includes-support-for-airpower-charging-mat-as-release-appears-imminent/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;included official support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the now-defunct wireless charger. And the second-generation AirPods even have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+2+Teardown/121471#s233841&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an illustration of the wireless charging mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the back of the box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/AqHaCKHPMGQWZ6u4&quot; width=&quot;6212&quot; height=&quot;3036&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AirPower was cancelled a mere nine days later, making us wonder what must have happened. After all, there are plenty of wireless charging mats on the market that can charge multiple devices at the same time. But unlike those mats (which are really just three separate chargers next to each other in the same unit), Apple wanted to take things to the next level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With that said, we have a theory as to why Apple’s wireless charger fell completely flat during its last-second Hail Mary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overheating and Interference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wireless charging pads use electromagnetic induction to juice up your phone. Both the pad and your phone contain wire coils: the pad draws current from the wall and runs it through the coil, creating an electromagnetic field. That field induces an electric current in your phone’s wire coil, which it uses to charge the battery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the electricity being transmitted to your phone isn’t perfectly clean or ideal. It generates some noise, which can interfere with other wireless devices. That’s why the FCC (and regulatory bodies in other countries) set strict limits on wireless emissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Noise from a single coil might not be a problem, but each charging coil generates a slightly different waveform. When those waves overlap, the constructive interference intensifies their strength. Just like when two ocean waves collide and combine their height, radio frequencies can combine their intensity as they interact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Managing these overlapping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;harmonic frequencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is incredibly challenging, and gets harder the more coils that you are integrating. From patent filings, it looks like Apple’s ambitious plan was to use considerably more coils than other charging pads on the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ZeVIYex5sbywgEnk&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;900&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rumors speculated that Apple was considering up to 32 coils—up from the fifteen shown in their conceptual patent filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other multi-device wireless chargers place two or three coils side-by-side, but require you to fiddle with your phone to find the “sweet spot” over one coil for it to start charging. With AirPower, Apple was trying to create one large charging surface using overlapping coils, allowing it to power multiple devices from anywhere on the mat. But that introduces multiple challenges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We asked an engineer with experience building wireless charging systems what obstacles Apple was working to overcome. “Over time, these harmonics add up and they become really powerful signals in the air,” explains William Lumpkins, VP of Engineering at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ons-services.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;O &amp;amp; S Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “And that can be difficult—that can stop someone’s pacemaker if it’s too high of a level. Or it could short circuit someone’s hearing aid.” If Apple’s multi-coil layout was spinning off harmonics left and right, it’s possible AirPower couldn’t pass muster with US or EU regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of what’s astonishing about the AirPower cancellation is how last-minute it was, right on the heels of the AirPods 2 release. But Lumpkins says that happens sometimes. He speculated that Apple had AirPower working in their labs: ”Well, so what always happens is you get it functional first. No one looks at [Electro-Magnetic Interference] until the end.” The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://fccid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FCC-Wireless-Charging-Rules.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FCC rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for wireless charging devices like AirPower are quite strict, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/1.1310&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;limit exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;at 20 cm (8 in) above the device to 50 mW/cm^2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869072/apple-airpower-overheating-issues&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rumors have circulated for months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about AirPower’s overheating issues, which would click nicely into place with this theory. In order to power multiple devices through a large array of coils, they would need a significant amount of power. “Overheating means they’re putting too much current into it, which means they’re trying to up the power level,” says Lumpkins. “My guess is they’re trying to pump out so much of a field, which is getting it to overheat.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple boxed themselves into an electromagnetic corner. What they wanted to do was physically possible—and they surely had it working in the lab—but they couldn’t consistently meet the rigorous transmission requirements that are designed to keep us safe from our gadgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook &amp;#039;mistakenly deleted&amp;#039; years of Mark Zuckerberg&amp;#039;s old Facebook posts</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-old-posts-mark-zuckerberg-disappeared-2019-3</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-old-posts-mark-zuckerberg-disappeared-2019-3</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Old Facebook posts by Mark Zuckerberg have disappeared — obscuring details about core moments in Facebook's history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On multiple occassions, years-old public posts made by the 34-year-old billionaire chief executive that were previously public and reported on by news outlets at the time have since vanished, Business Insider has found. That includes all of the posts he made during 2007 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reached for comment, a Facebook spokesperson said the posts were &quot;mistakenly deleted&quot; due to &quot;technical errors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;A few years ago some of Mark's posts were mistakenly deleted due to technical errors. The work required to restore them would have been extensive and not guaranteed to be successful so we didn't do it,&quot; the spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;We agree people should be able to find information about past announcements and major company news, which is why for years we've shared and archived this information publicly — first on our blog and in recent years on our Newsroom.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;These disappearances, along with other changes Facebook has made to how it saves its archive of announcements and blog posts, make it much harder to parse the social network's historical record. This makes it far more difficult to hold the company, and Zuckerberg himself, accountable to past statements — particularly during a period of intense scrutiny of the company in the wake of a string of scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The very nature of the issue means it is extremely challenging to make a full accounting of what exactly what has gone missing over the years. The spokesperson said they didn't know how many posts in total were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The curious case of Mark Zuckerberg's vanishing Facebook posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In April 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram — a now-pivotal moment in the growth of the Menlo Park, California technology giant. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-instagram-features/&quot;&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/facebook-acquires-instagram-for-a-reported-one-billion-dollars-9637&quot;&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt; from the time quoted from a public post that Zuckerberg made on his timeline about the acquisition — but that post now inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100318398827991&quot;&gt;The links to that post from old news articles&lt;/a&gt; no longer work, and it's nowhere to be seen on his profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was an important document in the history of Facebook, particularly given &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/facebook-acquires-instagram-for-a-reported-one-billion-dollars-9637&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg promised that&lt;/a&gt; &quot;we're committed to building and growing Instagram independently&quot; — a commitment he has since walked back. Facebook is now integrating the photo-sharing app into itself ever-more closely, and tensions around this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45635736&quot;&gt;contributed to the departure of Instagram's two cofounders in September 2018&lt;/a&gt;. (A copy of Zuckerbrerg's post has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2012/04/facebook-to-acquire-instagram/&quot;&gt;preserved in Facebook's Newsroom blog&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-exec-andrew-boz-bosworth-broke-rule-real-name-2019-1&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook exec Andrew Bosworth broke the social network's rule on using your real name for 8 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most drastic deletions involved entire years. Throughout both 2006 and 2009, Zuckerberg was regularly active on the social network — but there are no posts visible of any kind for the two full years in between. The spokesperson confirmed that all the posts during 2007 and 2008 were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;This is the error message you see when you click on a link to one of Mark Zuckerberg's vanished Facebook posts. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another, specific example from later on: Facebook's beloved head chef Josef Desimone died in a motorcycle crash in July 2013. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/22/josef-desimone/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch reported at the time that&lt;/a&gt; Zuckerberg shared the news &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100895107738711&quot;&gt;in a post on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. However, that post is now inaccessible as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook would go on to throw a party in Desimone's memory at its headquarters the following month. Hundreds of people were invited, and booze flowed freely — and it subsequently descended into chaos. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-2013-memorial-party-chef-violence-gangs-2019-3&quot;&gt;As Business Insider previously reported, multiple fights broke out among attendees&lt;/a&gt;, which security staff believed were gang-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Numerous other posts by Zuckerberg from these time periods remain publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook has also made it harder to navigate its archives of old announcements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lastly, there have been issues accessing Facebook's archive of older blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In years past, Facebook had a dedicated blog that announcements would often be posted to and which was navigable by month; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090618174214/http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2208197130&quot;&gt;an archived example of a post is available here, via the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2014, Facebook launched its new &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Newsroom,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; a repository for its key announcements, and broke the public links to old blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, when you click on a link to a blog post included in an old news story, it redirects you to the Newsroom. The Newsroom doesn't have copies of many of these old blog posts, meaning there's no easy way to access them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;They &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; still exist in one form — as a &quot;note&quot; saved to Facebook's public &quot;Facebook&quot; page on the social network. But until today there was no centralized archive through which to browse them, like what was available for the Facebook blog, or like what exists today for Newsroom posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead, to read a specific one, you had to either know about it already and search for keywords on Google, or scroll back through the Facebook page's thousands of posts over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After Business Insider reached out for comment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pg/facebook/notes/?ref=page_internal&quot;&gt;Facebook added a public &quot;notes&quot; tab to the Facebook page to access them&lt;/a&gt;. (A Facebook spokesperson said that the Notes tab should have been available since 2014, but &quot;a bug&quot; meant it wasn't viewable. Business Insider tried to find it prior to publication but encountered page-unavailable error messages.) As of press time, however, the notes tab was loading extremely slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;READ MORE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/catalina-facebook-bird-sized-drones-connectivity-data-2019-3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook secretly explored building bird-size drones to ferry data to people with bad internet connections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take, for example, the 2006 launch of the News Feed, which is now an advertising juggernaut that now makes billions of dollars for the company. Zuckerberg tried to quash early user backlash against the News Feed with a blog post called &quot;Calm down. Breathe. We hear you,&quot; but &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2208197130&quot;&gt;a link to it&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2006/09/06/facebook-users-revolt-facebook-replies/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch news report from the time&lt;/a&gt; now just redirects to the Newsroom homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There's no copy of the blog post in the Newsroom, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/calm-down-breathe-we-hear-you/2208197130/&quot;&gt;it's currently only available as a note from Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090618174214/http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2208197130&quot;&gt;Here's how it looked prior to the closure of the blog&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The net effect of this change to the archives was to drastically obfuscate Facebook's historical record — making it far harder to find past statements and announcements from the company about itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg's content has gone AWOL before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This isn't the first time Zuckerberg-related material has disappeared without warning from Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In April 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch reported that messages sent by the CEO were being deleted from other people's inboxes&lt;/a&gt; without their knowledge or consent — a feature that wasn't available to ordinary Facebook users at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;And back in November 2016, public posts from Zuckerberg about the media and Facebook's role in the 2016 US election also disappeared, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/29/13777018/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-election-post-disappeared&quot;&gt;The Verge reported at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the time, a spokesperson told the Verge that their removal was an accident and subsequently restored them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Day the Dinosaurs Died</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;137&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, on a certain evening about sixty-­six million years ago, you had stood somewhere in North America and looked up at the sky, you would have soon made out what appeared to be a star. If you watched for an hour or two, the star would have seemed to grow in brightness, although it barely moved. That’s because it was not a star but an asteroid, and it was headed directly for Earth at about forty-five thousand miles an hour. Sixty hours later, the asteroid hit. The air in front was compressed and violently heated, and it blasted a hole through the atmosphere, generating a supersonic shock wave. The asteroid struck a shallow sea where the Yucatán peninsula is today. In that moment, the Cretaceous period ended and the Paleogene period began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory used what was then one of the world’s most powerful computers, the so-called Q Machine, to model the effects of the impact. The result was a slow-motion, second-by-second false-color video of the event. Within two minutes of slamming into Earth, the asteroid, which was at least six miles wide, had gouged a crater about eighteen miles deep and lofted twenty-five trillion metric tons of debris into the atmosphere. Picture the splash of a pebble falling into pond water, but on a planetary scale. When Earth’s crust rebounded, a peak higher than Mt. Everest briefly rose up. The energy released was more than that of a billion Hiroshima bombs, but the blast looked nothing like a nuclear explosion, with its signature mushroom cloud. Instead, the initial blowout formed a “rooster tail,” a gigantic jet of molten material, which exited the atmosphere, some of it fanning out over North America. Much of the material was several times hotter than the surface of the sun, and it set fire to everything within a thousand miles. In addition, an inverted cone of liquefied, superheated rock rose, spread outward as countless red-hot blobs of glass, called tektites, and blanketed the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the ejecta escaped Earth’s gravitational pull and went into irregular orbits around the sun. Over millions of years, bits of it found their way to other planets and moons in the solar system. Mars was eventually strewn with the debris—just as pieces of Mars, knocked aloft by ancient asteroid impacts, have been found on Earth. A 2013 study in the journal &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Astrobiology&lt;/em&gt; estimated that tens of thousands of pounds of impact rubble may have landed on Titan, a moon of Saturn, and on Europa and Callisto, which orbit Jupiter—three satellites that scientists believe may have promising habitats for life. Mathematical models indicate that at least some of this vagabond debris still harbored living microbes. The asteroid may have sown life throughout the solar system, even as it ravaged life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asteroid was vaporized on impact. Its substance, mingling with vaporized Earth rock, formed a fiery plume, which reached halfway to the moon before collapsing in a pillar of incandescent dust. Computer models suggest that the atmosphere within fifteen hundred miles of ground zero became red hot from the debris storm, triggering gigantic forest fires. As the Earth rotated, the airborne material converged at the opposite side of the planet, where it fell and set fire to the entire Indian subcontinent. Measurements of the layer of ash and soot that eventually coated the Earth indicate that fires consumed about seventy per cent of the world’s forests. Meanwhile, giant tsunamis resulting from the impact churned across the Gulf of Mexico, tearing up coastlines, sometimes peeling up hundreds of feet of rock, pushing debris inland and then sucking it back out into deep water, leaving jumbled deposits that oilmen sometimes encounter in the course of deep-sea drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage had only begun. Scientists still debate many of the details, which are derived from the computer models, and from field studies of the debris layer, knowledge of extinction rates, fossils and microfossils, and many other clues. But the over-all view is consistently grim. The dust and soot from the impact and the conflagrations prevented all sunlight from reaching the planet’s surface for months. Photosynthesis all but stopped, killing most of the plant life, extinguishing the phytoplankton in the oceans, and causing the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere to plummet. After the fires died down, Earth plunged into a period of cold, perhaps even a deep freeze. Earth’s two essential food chains, in the sea and on land, collapsed. About seventy-five per cent of all species went extinct. More than 99.9999 per cent of all living organisms on Earth died, and the carbon cycle came to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth itself became toxic. When the asteroid struck, it vaporized layers of limestone, releasing into the atmosphere a trillion tons of carbon dioxide, ten billion tons of methane, and a billion tons of carbon monoxide; all three are powerful greenhouse gases. The impact also vaporized anhydrite rock, which blasted ten trillion tons of sulfur compounds aloft. The sulfur combined with water to form sulfuric acid, which then fell as an acid rain that may have been potent enough to strip the leaves from any surviving plants and to leach the nutrients from the soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the layer of debris, ash, and soot deposited by the asteroid strike is preserved in the Earth’s sediment as a stripe of black about the thickness of a notebook. This is called the KT boundary, because it marks the dividing line between the Cretaceous period and the Tertiary period. (The Tertiary has been redefined as the Paleogene, but the term “KT” persists.) Mysteries abound above and below the KT layer. In the late Cretaceous, widespread volcanoes spewed vast quantities of gas and dust into the atmosphere, and the air contained far higher levels of carbon dioxide than the air that we breathe now. The climate was tropical, and the planet was perhaps entirely free of ice. Yet scientists know very little about the animals and plants that were living at the time, and as a result they have been searching for fossil deposits as close to the KT boundary as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the central mysteries of paleontology is the so-called “three-­metre problem.” In a century and a half of assiduous searching, almost no dinosaur remains have been found in the layers three metres, or about nine feet, below the KT boundary, a depth representing many thousands of years. Consequently, numerous paleontologists have argued that the dinosaurs were on the way to extinction long before the asteroid struck, owing perhaps to the volcanic eruptions and climate change. Other scientists have countered that the three-metre problem merely reflects how hard it is to find fossils. Sooner or later, they’ve contended, a scientist will discover dinosaurs much closer to the moment of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locked in the KT boundary are the answers to our questions about one of the most significant events in the history of life on the planet. If one looks at the Earth as a kind of living organism, as many biologists do, you could say that it was shot by a bullet and almost died. Deciphering what happened on the day of destruction is crucial not only to solving the three-­metre problem but also to explaining our own genesis as a species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 5, 2013, I received an e-mail from a graduate student named Robert DePalma. I had never met DePalma, but we had corresponded on paleontological matters for years, ever since he had read a novel I’d written that centered on the discovery of a fossilized &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt; killed by the KT impact. “I have made an incredible and unprecedented discovery,” he wrote me, from a truck stop in Bowman, North Dakota. “It is extremely confidential and only three others know of it at the moment, all of them close colleagues.” He went on, “It is far more unique and far rarer than any simple dinosaur discovery. I would prefer not outlining the details via e-mail, if possible.” He gave me his cell-phone number and a time to call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called, and he told me that he had discovered a site like the one I’d imagined in my novel, which contained, among other things, direct victims of the catastrophe. At first, I was skeptical. DePalma was a scientific nobody, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Kansas, and he said that he had found the site with no institutional backing and no collaborators. I thought that he was likely exaggerating, or that he might even be crazy. (Paleontology has more than its share of unusual people.) But I was intrigued enough to get on a plane to North Dakota to see for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma’s find was in the Hell Creek geological formation, which outcrops in parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, and contains some of the most storied dinosaur beds in the world. At the time of the impact, the Hell Creek landscape consisted of steamy, subtropical lowlands and floodplains along the shores of an inland sea. The land teemed with life and the conditions were excellent for fossilization, with seasonal floods and meandering rivers that rapidly buried dead animals and plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinosaur hunters first discovered these rich fossil beds in the late nineteenth century. In 1902, Barnum Brown, a flamboyant dinosaur hunter who worked at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York, found the first &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tyrannosaurus rex&lt;/em&gt; here, causing a worldwide sensation. One paleontologist estimated that in the Cretaceous period Hell Creek was so thick with &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rexes&lt;/em&gt; that they were like hyenas on the Serengeti. It was also home to triceratops and duckbills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hell Creek Formation spanned the Cretaceous and the Paleogene periods, and paleontologists had known for at least half a century that an extinction had occurred then, because dinosaurs were found below, but never above, the KT layer. This was true not only in Hell Creek but all over the world. For many years, scientists believed that the KT extinction was no great mystery: over millions of years, volcanism, climate change, and other events gradually killed off many forms of life. But, in the late nineteen-seventies, a young geologist named Walter Alvarez and his father, Luis Alvarez, a nuclear physicist, discovered that the KT layer was laced with unusually high amounts of the rare metal iridium, which, they hypothesized, was from the dusty remains of an asteroid impact. In an article in &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1980, they proposed that this impact was so large that it triggered the mass extinction, and that the KT layer was the debris from that event. Most paleontologists rejected the idea that a sudden, random encounter with space junk had drastically altered the evolution of life on Earth. But as the years passed the evidence mounted, until, in a 1991 paper, the smoking gun was announced: the discovery of an impact crater buried under thousands of feet of sediment in the Yucatán peninsula, of exactly the right age, and of the right size and geochemistry, to have caused a worldwide cataclysm. The crater and the asteroid were named Chicxulub, after a small Mayan town near the epicenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the authors of the 1991 paper, David Kring, was so frightened by what he learned of the impact’s destructive nature that he became a leading voice in calling for a system to identify and neutralize threatening asteroids. “There’s no uncertainty to this statement: the Earth will be hit by a Chicxulub-size asteroid again, unless we deflect it,” he told me. “Even a three-hundred-metre rock would end world agriculture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, forty-one researchers in many scientific disciplines announced, in a landmark &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article, that the issue should be considered settled: a huge asteroid impact caused the extinction. But opposition to the idea remains passionate. The main competing hypothesis is that the colossal “Deccan” volcanic eruptions, in what would become India, spewed enough sulfur and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to cause a climatic shift. The eruptions, which began before the KT impact and continued after it, were among the biggest in Earth’s history, lasting hundreds of thousands of years, and burying half a million square miles of the Earth’s surface a mile deep in lava. The three-­metre gap below the KT layer, proponents argued, was evidence that the mass extinction was well under way by the time of the asteroid strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;85&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, DePalma, at the time a twenty-­two-year-old paleontology undergraduate, began excavating a small site in the Hell Creek Formation. The site had once been a pond, and the deposit consisted of very thin layers of sediment. Normally, one geological layer might represent thousands or millions of years. But DePalma was able to show that each layer in the deposit had been laid down in a single big rainstorm. “We could see when there were buds on the trees,” he told me. “We could see when the cypresses were dropping their needles in the fall. We could experience this in real time.” Peering at the layers was like flipping through a paleo-history book that chronicled decades of ecology in its silty pages. DePalma’s adviser, the late Larry Martin, urged him to find a similar site, but one that had layers closer to the KT boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, DePalma, now thirty-seven, is still working toward his Ph.D. He holds the unpaid position of curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History, a nascent and struggling museum with no exhibition space. In 2012, while looking for a new pond deposit, he heard that a private collector had stumbled upon an unusual site on a cattle ranch near Bowman, North Dakota. (Much of the Hell Creek land is privately owned, and ranchers will sell digging rights to whoever will pay decent money, paleontologists and commercial fossil collectors alike.) The collector felt that the site, a three-foot-deep layer exposed at the surface, was a bust: it was packed with fish fossils, but they were so delicate that they crumbled into tiny flakes as soon as they met the air. The fish were encased in layers of damp, cracked mud and sand that had never solidified; it was so soft that it could be dug with a shovel or pulled apart by hand. In July, 2012, the collector showed DePalma the site and told him that he was welcome to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was immediately very disappointed,” DePalma told me. He was hoping for a site like the one he’d excavated earlier: an ancient pond with fine-grained, fossil-bearing layers that spanned many seasons and years. Instead, everything had been deposited in a single flood. But as DePalma poked around he saw potential. The flood had entombed everything immediately, so specimens were exquisitely preserved. He found many complete fish, which are rare in the Hell Creek Formation, and he figured that he could remove them intact if he worked with painstaking care. He agreed to pay the rancher a certain amount for each season that he worked there. (The specifics of the arrangement, as is standard practice in paleontology, are a closely guarded secret. The site is now under exclusive long-term lease.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following July, DePalma returned to do a preliminary excavation of the site. “Almost right away, I saw it was unusual,” he told me. He began shovelling off the layers of soil above where he’d found the fish. This “overburden” is typically material that was deposited long after the specimen lived; there’s little in it to interest a paleontologist, and it is usually discarded. But as soon as DePalma started digging he noticed grayish-white specks in the layers which looked like grains of sand but which, under a hand lens, proved to be tiny spheres and elongated ­droplets. “I think, Holy shit, these look like microtektites!” DePalma recalled. Micro­tektites are the blobs of glass that form when molten rock is blasted into the air by an asteroid impact and falls back to Earth in a solidifying drizzle. The site appeared to contain micro­tektites by the million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As DePalma carefully excavated the upper layers, he began uncovering an extraordinary array of fossils, exceedingly delicate but marvellously well preserved. “There’s amazing plant material in there, all interlaced and interlocked,” he recalled. “There are logjams of wood, fish pressed against cypress-­tree root bundles, tree trunks smeared with amber.” Most fossils end up being squashed flat by the pressure of the overlying stone, but here everything was three-dimensional, including the fish, having been encased in sediment all at once, which acted as a support. “You see skin, you see dorsal fins literally sticking straight up in the sediments, species new to science,” he said. As he dug, the momentousness of what he had come across slowly dawned on him. If the site was what he hoped, he had made the most important paleontological discovery of the new century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DePalma grew up in Boca Raton, Florida, and as a child he was fascinated by bones and the stories they contained. His father, Robert, Sr., practices endodontic surgery in nearby Delray Beach; his great-uncle Anthony, who died in 2005, at the age of a hundred, was a renowned orthopedic surgeon who wrote several standard textbooks on the subject. (Anthony’s son, Robert’s cousin, is the film director Brian De Palma.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Between the ages of three and four, I made a visual connection with the gracefulness of individual bones and how they fit together as a system,” DePalma told me. “That really struck me. I went after whatever on the dinner table had bones in it.” His family ­buried their dead pets in one spot and put the burial markers in another, so that he wouldn’t dig up the corpses; he found them anyway. He froze dead lizards in ice-cube trays, which his mother would discover when she had friends over for iced tea. “I was never into sports,” he said. “They tried to get me to do that so I would get along with the other kids. But I was digging up the baseball field looking for bones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma’s great-uncle Anthony, who lived in Pompano Beach, took him under his wing. “I used to visit him every other weekend and show him my latest finds,” DePalma said. When he was four, someone at a museum in Texas gave him a fragment of dinosaur bone, which he took to his great-uncle. “He taught me that all those little knobs and rough patches and protrusions on a bone had names, and that the bone also had a name,” DePalma said. “I was captivated.” At six or seven, on trips to Central Florida with his family, he started finding his own fossilized bones from mammals dating back to the Ice Age. He found his first dinosaur bone when he was nine, in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, during the summer and on weekends, DePalma collected fossils, made dinosaur models, and mounted skeletons for the Graves Museum of Archaeology and Natural History, in Dania Beach. He loaned the museum his childhood fossil collection for display, but in 2004 the museum went bankrupt and many of the specimens were carted off to a community college. DePalma had no paperwork to prove his ownership, and a court refused to return his fossils, which numbered in the hundreds. They were mostly locked away in storage, unavailable for public display and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismayed by what he called the “wasteful mismanagement” of his collection, DePalma adopted some unusual collecting practices. Typically, paleontologists cede the curation and the care of their specimens to the institutions that hold them. But DePalma insists on contractual clauses that give him oversight of the management of his specimens. He never digs on public land, because of what he considers excessive government red tape. But, without federal support for his work, he must cover almost all the costs himself. His out-of-pocket expenses for working the Hell Creek site amount to tens of thousands of dollars. He helps defray the expenses by mounting fossils, doing reconstructions, and casting and selling replicas for museums, private collectors, and other clients. At times, his parents have chipped in. “I squeak by,” he said. “If it’s a ­tossup between getting more PaleoBond”—an expensive liquid glue used to hold fossils together—“or changing the air-conditioning filter, I’m getting the PaleoBond.” He is single, and shares a three-bedroom apartment with casts of various dinosaurs, including one of a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nanotyrannus&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s hard to have a life outside of my work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma’s control of his research collection is controversial. Fossils are a big business; wealthy collectors pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions, for a rare specimen. (In 1997, a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; nicknamed Sue was sold at a Sotheby’s auction, to the Field Museum of Natural History, in Chicago, for more than $8.3 million.) The American market is awash in fossils illegally smuggled out of China and Mongolia. But in the U.S. fossil collecting on private property is legal, as is the buying, selling, and exporting of fossils. Many scientists view this trade as a threat to paleontology and argue that important fossils belong in museums. “I’m not allowed to have a private collection of anything I’m studying,” one prominent curator told me. DePalma insists that he maintains “the best of both worlds” for his fossils. He has deposited portions of his collection at several nonprofit institutions, including the University of Kansas, the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History, and Florida Atlantic University; some specimens are temporarily housed in various analytical labs that are conducting tests on them—all overseen by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, DePalma briefly made news with a paper he published in the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. Four years earlier, in Hell Creek, he and a field assistant, Robert Feeney, found an odd, lumpy growth of fossilized bone that turned out to be two fused vertebrae from the tail of a hadrosaur, a duck-billed dinosaur from the Cretaceous period. DePalma thought that the bone might have grown around a foreign object and encased it. He took it to Lawrence Memorial Hospital, in Kansas, where a CT technician scanned it for free in the middle of the night, when the machine was idle. Inside the nodule was a broken tyrannosaur tooth; the hadrosaur had been bitten by a tyrannosaur and escaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery helped refute an old hypothesis, revived by the formidable paleontologist Jack Horner, that &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; was solely a scavenger. Horner argued that &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; was too slow and lumbering, its arms too puny and its eyesight too poor, to prey on other creatures. When DePalma’s find was picked up by the national media, Horner dismissed it as “speculation” and merely “one data point.” He suggested an alternative scenario: the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; might have accidentally bitten the tail of a sleeping hadrosaur, thinking that it was dead, and then “backed away” when it realized its mistake. “I thought that was absolutely preposterous,” DePalma told me. At the time, he told the Los Angeles &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, “A scavenger doesn’t come across a food source and realize all of a sudden that it’s alive.” Horner eventually conceded that &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; may have hunted live prey. But, when I asked Horner about DePalma recently, he said at first that he didn’t remember him: “In the community, we don’t get to know students very well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without his Ph.D., DePalma remains mostly invisible, awaiting the stamp of approval that signals the beginning of a serious research career. Several paleontologists I talked to had not heard of him. Another, who asked not to be named, said, “Finding that kind of fossil was pretty cool, but not life-­changing. People sometimes think I’m dumb because I often say I don’t have the answers—we weren’t there when a fossil was formed. There are other people out there who say they do know, and he’s one of those people. I think he can overinterpret.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving DePalma’s e-mail, I made arrangements to visit the Hell Creek site; three weeks later I was in Bowman. DePalma pulled up to my hotel in a Toyota 4Runner, its stereo blasting the theme to “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” He wore a coarse cotton work shirt, cargo pants with canvas ­suspenders, and a suède cowboy hat with the left brim snapped up. His face was tanned from long days in the sun and he had a five-day-old beard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in, and we drove for an hour or so, turning through a ranch gate and following a maze of bone-rattling roads that eventually petered out in a grassy basin. The scattered badlands of Hell Creek form an otherworldly landscape. This is far-flung ranching and farming country; prairies and sunflower fields stretch to the horizon, domed by the great blue skies of the American West. Roads connect small towns—truck stop, church, motel, houses and trailers—and lonely expanses roll by in between. Here and there in the countryside, abandoned farmhouses lean into the ground. Over millions of years, the Hell Creek layer has been heavily eroded, leaving only remnants, which jut from the prairie like so many rotten teeth. These lifeless buttes and pinnacles are striped in beige, chocolate, yellow, maroon, russet, gray, and white. Fossils, worked loose by wind and rain, spill down the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, DePalma’s site lay open in front of us: a desolate hump of gray, cracked earth, about the size of two soccer fields. It looked as if a piece of the moon had dropped there. One side of the deposit was cut through by a sandy wash, or dry streambed; the other ended in a low escarpment. The dig was a three-foot-deep rectangular hole, sixty feet long by forty feet wide. A couple of two-by-fours, along with various digging tools and some metal pipe for taking core samples, leaned against the far side of the hole. As we strolled around the site, I noticed on DePalma’s belt a long fixed-blade knife and a sheathed bayonet—a Second World War relic that his uncle gave him when he was twelve, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled the moment of discovery. The first fossil he removed, earlier that summer, was a five-foot-long freshwater paddlefish. Paddlefish still live today; they have a long bony snout, with which they probe murky water in search of food. When DePalma took out the fossil, he found underneath it a tooth from a mosasaur, a giant carnivorous marine reptile. He wondered how a freshwater fish and a marine reptile could have ended up in the same place, on a riverbank at least several miles inland from the nearest sea. (At the time, a shallow body of water, called the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the proto-­Gulf of Mexico up through part of North America.) The next day, he found a two-foot-wide tail from another marine fish; it looked as if it had been violently ripped from the fish’s body. “If the fish is dead for any length of time, those tails decay and fall apart,” DePalma said. But this one was perfectly intact, “so I knew that it was transported at the time of death or around then.” Like the mosasaur tooth, it had somehow ended up miles inland from the sea of its origin. “When I found that, I thought, There’s no way, this can’t be right,” DePalma said. The discoveries hinted at an extraordinary conclusion that he wasn’t quite ready to accept. “I was ninety-eight per cent con­vinced at that point,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day, DePalma noticed a small disturbance preserved in the sediment. About three inches in diameter, it appeared to be a crater formed by an object that had fallen from the sky and plunked down in mud. Similar formations, caused by hailstones hitting a muddy surface, had been found before in the fossil record. As DePalma shaved back the layers to make a cross-­section of the crater, he found the thing itself—not a hailstone but a small white sphere—at the bottom of the crater. It was a tektite, about three millimetres in diameter—the fallout from an ancient asteroid impact. As he continued excavating, he found another crater with a tektite at the bottom, and another, and another. Glass turns to clay over millions of years, and these tektites were now clay, but some still had glassy cores. The microtektites he had found earlier might have been carried there by water, but these had been trapped where they fell—on what, DePalma believed, must have been the very day of the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I saw that, I knew this wasn’t just any flood deposit,” DePalma said. “We weren’t just near the KT boundary—this whole site &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the KT boundary!” From surveying and mapping the layers, DePalma hypothesized that a massive inland surge of water flooded a river valley and filled the low-lying area where we now stood, perhaps as a result of the KT-impact tsunami, which had roared across the proto-Gulf and up the Western Interior Seaway. As the water slowed and became slack, it deposited everything that had been caught up in its travels—the heaviest material first, up to whatever was floating on the surface. All of it was quickly entombed and preserved in the muck: dying and dead creatures, both marine and freshwater; plants, seeds, tree trunks, roots, cones, pine needles, flowers, and pollen; shells, bones, teeth, and eggs; tektites, shocked minerals, tiny diamonds, iridium-laden dust, ash, charcoal, and amber-smeared wood. As the sediments settled, blobs of glass rained into the mud, the largest first, then finer and finer bits, until grains sifted down like snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have the whole KT event preserved in these sediments,” DePalma said. “With this deposit, we can chart what happened the day the Cretaceous died.” No paleontological site remotely like it had ever been found, and, if DePalma’s hypothesis proves correct, the scientific value of the site will be immense. When Walter Alvarez visited the dig last summer, he was astounded. “It is truly a magnificent site,” he wrote to me, adding that it’s “surely one of the best sites ever found for telling just what happened on the day of the impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When DePalma finished showing me the dig, he introduced me to a field assistant, Rudy Pascucci, the director of the Palm Beach Museum. Pascucci, a muscular man in his fifties, was sunburned and unshaven, and wore a sleeveless T-shirt, snakeproof camouflage boots, and a dusty Tilley hat. The two men gathered their tools, got down on the floor of the hole, and began probing the three-foot-high walls of the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For rough digging, DePalma likes to use his bayonet and a handheld Marsh pick, popularized by the nineteenth-­century Yale paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh, who pioneered dinosaur-hunting in the American West and dis­covered eighty new species. The pick was given to him by David Burnham, his thesis adviser at Kansas, when he completed his master’s degree. For fine work, DePalma uses X-Acto knives and brushes—the typical tools of a paleontologist—as well as dental instruments given to him by his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposit consisted of dozens of thin layers of mud and sand. Lower down, it graded into a more turbulent band of sand and gravel, which contained the heavier fish fossils, bones, and bigger tektites. Below that layer was a hard surface of sandstone, the original Cretaceous bedrock of the site, much of which had been scoured smooth by the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleontology is maddening work, its progress typically measured in millimetres. As I watched, DePalma and Pascucci lay on their stomachs under the beating sun, their eyes inches from the dirt wall, and picked away. DePalma poked the tip of an X-Acto into the thin laminations of sediment and loosened one dime-size flake at a time; he’d examine it closely, and, if he saw nothing, flick it away. When the chips accumulated, he gathered them into small piles with a paintbrush; when those piles accumulated, Pascucci swept them into larger piles with a broom and then shovelled them into a heap at the far end of the dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, DePalma came across small plant fossils—flower petals, leaves, seeds, pine needles, and bits of bark. Many of these were mere impressions in the mud, which would crack and peel as soon as they were exposed to the air. He quickly squirted them with PaleoBond, which soaked into the fossils and held them together. Or, us­ing another technique, he mixed a batch of plaster and poured it on the spec­imen before it fell apart. This would preserve, in plaster, a reverse image of the fossil; the original was too short-lived to be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mosquitoes got bad, DePalma took out a briar pipe and packed it with Royal Cherry Cavendish tobacco. He put a lighter to it and vigorously puffed, wreathing himself in sickly-­sweet smoke, then went back to work. “I’m like a shopaholic in a shoe store,” he said. “I want everything!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed me the impression of a round object about two inches wide. “This is either a flower or an echinoderm,” he said, referring to a group of marine life-forms that includes sea urchins and starfish. “I’ll figure it out in the lab.” He swiftly entombed it in Paleo­Bond and plaster. Next, he found a perfect leaf, and near that a seed from a pinecone. “Cretaceous mulch,” he said, dismissively; he already had many similar examples. He found three more small craters with tektites in them, which he sectioned and photographed. Then his X-Acto blade turned up a tiny brown bone—a jaw, less than a quarter inch in length. He held it up between his fingers and peered at it with a lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A mammal,” he said. “This one was already dead when it was buried.” Weeks later, in the lab, he identified the jaw as probably belonging to a mam­mal distantly related to primates—including us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later, DePalma discovered a large feather. “Every day is Christmas out here,” he said. He exposed the feather with precise movements. It was a crisp impression in the layer of mud, perhaps thirteen inches long. “This is my ninth feather,” he said. “The first fossil feathers ever found at Hell Creek. I’m convinced these are dinosaur feathers. I don’t know for sure. But these are primitive feathers, and most are a foot long. There are zero birds that big from Hell Creek with feathers this primitive. It’s more parsimonious to suggest it was a known dinosaur, most likely a theropod, possibly a raptor.” He kept digging. “Maybe we’ll find the raptor that these feathers came from, but I doubt it. These feathers could have floated from a long way off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His X-Acto knife unearthed the edge of a fossilized fin. Another paddlefish came to light; it later proved to be nearly six feet long. DePalma probed the sediment around it, to gauge its position and how best to extract it. As more of it was exposed, we could clearly see that the fish’s two-foot-long snout had broken when it was forced—probably by the flood’s surge—against the branches of a submerged araucaria tree. He noted that every fish he’d found in the site had died with its mouth open, which may indicate that the fish had been gasping as they suffocated in the sediment-laden water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most died in a vertical position in the sediment, didn’t even tip over on their sides,” he said. “And they weren’t scavenged, because whatever would have dug them up afterward was probably gone.” He chipped away around the paddlefish, exposing a fin bone, then a half-dollar-size patch of fossilized skin with the scales perfectly visible. He treated these by saturating them with his own special blend of hardener. Because of the extreme fragility of the fossils, he would take them back to his lab, in Florida, totally encased in sediment, or “matrix.” In the lab, he would free each fossil under a magnifying glass, in precisely controlled conditions, away from the damaging effects of sun, wind, and aridity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As DePalma worked around the paddlefish, more of the araucaria branch came to light, including its short, spiky needles. “This tree was alive when it was buried,” he said. Then he noticed a golden blob of amber stuck to the branch. Amber is preserved tree resin and often contains traces of whatever was in the air at the time, trapping the atmospheric chemistry and even, sometimes, insects and small reptiles. “This is Cretaceous flypaper,” he said. “I can’t wait to get this back to the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour later, he had chiselled all the way around the fish, leaving it encased in matrix, supported by a four-inch-tall pedestal of rock. “I’m pretty sure this is a species new to science,” he said. Because the soft tissue had also fossilized, he said, even the animal’s stomach contents might still be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He straightened up. “Time to plaster,” he said. He took off his shirt and began mixing a five-gallon bucket of plaster with his hands, while Pascucci tore strips of burlap. DePalma took a two-by-four and sawed off two foot-long pieces and placed them like splints on either side of the sediment-encased fossil. One by one, he dipped the burlap strips in the plaster and draped them across the top and the sides of the specimen. He added rope handles and plastered them in. An hour later, when the plaster had cured, he chiselled through the rock pedestal beneath the fossil and flipped the specimen over, leaving the underside exposed. Back in the lab, he would go through this surface to access the fossil, with the plaster jacket acting as a cradle below. Using the rope handles, DePalma and Pascucci lugged the specimen, which weighed perhaps two hundred pounds, to the truck and loaded it into the back. Later, DePalma would store it behind a friend’s ranch house, where all his jacketed fossils from the season were laid out in rows, covered with tarps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma resumed digging. Gusts of wind stirred up clouds of dust, and rain fell; when the weather cleared, the late-afternoon sun spilled across the prairie. DePalma was lost in another day, in another time. “Here’s a piece of wood with bark-beetle traces,” he said. Plant fossils from the first several million years after the impact show almost no signs of such damage; the insects were mostly gone. The asteroid had likely struck in the fall, DePalma speculated. He had reached this conclusion by comparing the juvenile paddlefish and sturgeon he’d found with the species’ known growth rates and hatching seasons; he’d also found the seeds of conifers, figs, and certain flowers. “When we analyze the pollen and diatomaceous particles, that will narrow it down,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week that followed, fresh riches emerged: more feathers, leaves, seeds, and amber, along with several other fish, three to five feet long, and a dozen more craters with tektites. I have visited many paleontological sites, but I had never seen so many specimens found so quickly. Most digs are boring; days or weeks may pass with little found. DePalma seemed to make a noteworthy discovery about every half hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When DePalma first visited the site, he noted, partially embedded on the surface, the hip bone of a dinosaur in the ceratopsian family, of which triceratops is the best-known member. A commercial collector had tried to remove it years earlier; it had been abandoned in place and was crumbling from years of exposure. DePalma initially dismissed it as “trash” and decried the irresponsibility of the collector. Later, though, he wondered how the bone, which was heavy, had arrived there, very close to the high-water mark of the flood. It must have floated, he said, and to have done so it must have been encased in desiccated tissue—suggesting that at least one dinosaur species was alive at the time of the impact. He later found a suitcase-size piece of fossilized skin from a ceratopsian attached to the hip bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, DePalma set off to photograph the layers of the deposit which had been cut through and exposed by the sandy wash. He scraped smooth a vertical section and misted it with water from a spray bottle to bring out the color. The bottom layer was jumbled; the first rush of water had ripped up layers of mud, gravel, and rocks and tumbled them about with pieces of burned (and burning) wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then DePalma came to a faint jug-shaped outline in the wall of the wash. He examined it closely. It started as a tunnel at the top of the KT layer, went down, and then widened into a round cavity, filled with soil of a different color, which stopped at the hard sandstone of the undisturbed bedrock layer below. It looked as though a small animal had dug through the mud to create a hideout. “Is that a burrow?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma scraped the area smooth with his bayonet, then sprayed it. “You’re darn right it is,” he said. “And this isn’t the burrow of a small dinosaur. It’s a mammal burrow.” (Burrows have characteristic shapes, depending on the species that inhabit them.) He peered at it, his eyes inches from the rock, probing it with the tip of the bayonet. “Gosh, I think it’s still in there!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He planned to remove the entire burrow intact, in a block, and run it through a CT scanner back home, to see what it contained. “Any Cretaceous mammal burrow is incredibly rare,” he said. “But this one is impossible—it’s dug right through the KT boundary.” Perhaps, he said, the mammal survived the impact and the flood, burrowed into the mud to escape the freezing darkness, then died. “It may have been born in the Cretaceous and died in the Paleocene,” he said. “And to think—sixty-­six million years later, a stinky monkey is digging it up, trying to figure out what happened.” He added, “If it’s a new species, I’ll name it after you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left Hell Creek, DePalma pressed me on the need for secrecy: I was to tell no one, not even close friends, about what he’d found. The history of paleontology is full of tales of bribery, backstabbing, and double-­dealing. In the nineteenth century, ­Othniel C. Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, the nation’s two leading paleontologists, engaged in a bitter competition to collect dinosaur fossils in the American West. They raided each other’s quarries, bribed each other’s crews, and vilified each other in print and at scientific meetings. In 1890, the New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt; began a series of sensational articles about the controversy with the headline “&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Scientists Wage Bitter Warfare.&lt;/em&gt;” The rivalry has since become known as the Bone Wars. The days of skulduggery in paleontology have not passed; DePalma was deeply concerned that the site would be expropriated by a major museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;167&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePalma knew that a screwup with this site would probably end his career, and that his status in the field was so uncertain that he needed to fortify the find against potential criticism. He had already experienced harsh judgment when, in 2015, he published a paper on a new species of dinosaur called a Dakotaraptor, and mistakenly inserted a fossil turtle bone in the reconstruction. Although rebuilding a skeleton from thousands of bone fragments that have commingled with those of other species is not easy, DePalma was mor­tified by the attacks. “I never want to go through that again,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For five years, DePalma continued excavations at the site. He quietly shared his findings with a half-dozen luminaries in the field of KT studies, including Walter Alvarez, and enlisted their help. During the winter months, when not in the field, DePalma prepared and analyzed his specimens, a few at a time, in a colleague’s lab at Florida Atlantic University, in Boca Raton. The lab was a windowless, wedge­like room in the geology building, lined with bubbling aquarium tanks and shelves heaped with books, scientific journals, pieces of coral, mastodon teeth, seashells, and a stack of .50-­calibre machine-gun rounds, dating from the Second World War, that the lab’s owner had recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. DePalma had carved out a space for himself in a corner, just large enough for him to work on one or two jacketed fossils at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first visited the lab, in April, 2014, a block of stone three feet long by eighteen inches wide lay on a table under bright lights and a large magnifying lens. The block, DePalma said, contained a sturgeon and a paddlefish, along with dozens of smaller fossils and a single small, perfect crater with a tektite in it. The lower parts of the block consisted of debris, fragments of bone, and loose tektites that had been dislodged and caught up in the turbulence. The block told the story of the impact in microcosm. “It was a very bad day,” DePalma said. “Look at these two fish.” He showed me where the sturgeon’s scutes—the sharp, bony plates on its back—had been forced into the body of the paddlefish. One fish was impaled on the other. The mouth of the paddlefish was agape, and jammed into its gill rakers were microtektites—sucked in by the fish as it tried to breathe. DePalma said, “This fish was likely alive for some time after being caught in the wave, long enough to gasp frenzied mouthfuls of water in a vain attempt to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, DePalma was piecing together a potential picture of the disaster. By the time the site flooded, the surrounding forest was already on fire, given the abundance of charcoal, charred wood, and amber he’d found at the site. The water arrived not as a curling wave but as a powerful, roiling rise, packed with disoriented fish and plant and animal debris, which, DePalma hypothesized, were laid down as the water slowed and receded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lab, DePalma showed me magnified cross-sections of the sediment. Most of its layers were horizontal, but a few formed curlicues or flamelike patterns called truncated flame structures, which were caused by a combination of weight from above and mini-surges in the incoming water. DePalma found five sets of these patterns. He turned back to the block on his table and held a magnifying lens up to the tektite. Parallel, streaming lines were visible on its surface—Schlieren lines, formed by two types of molten glass swirling together as the blobs arced through the atmosphere. Peering through the lens, DePalma picked away at the block with a dental probe. He soon exposed a section of pink, pearlescent shell, which had been pushed up against the sturgeon. “Ammonite,” he said. Ammonites were marine mollusks that somewhat resemble the present-day nautilus, although they were more closely related to squid and octopi. As DePalma uncovered more of the shell, I watched its vibrant color fade. “Live ammonite, ripped apart by the tsunami—they don’t travel well,” he said. “Genus &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sphenodiscus&lt;/em&gt;, I would think.” The shell, which hadn’t previously been documented in the Hell Creek Formation, was another marine victim tossed inland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood up. “Now I’m going to show you something special,” he said, opening a wooden crate and removing an object that was covered in aluminum foil. He unwrapped a sixteen-inch fossil feather, and held it in his palms like a piece of Lalique glass. “When I found the first feather, I had about twenty seconds of disbelief,” he said. DePalma had studied under Larry Martin, a world authority on the Cretaceous predecessors of birds, and had been “exposed to a lot of fossil feathers. When I encountered this damn thing, I immediately understood the importance of it. And now look at this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the lab table, he grabbed a fossil forearm belonging to Dakotaraptor, the dinosaur species he’d discovered in Hell Creek. He pointed to a series of regular bumps on the bone. “These are probably quill knobs,” he said. “This dinosaur had feathers on its forearms. Now watch.” With precision calipers, he measured the diameter of the quill knobs, then the diameter of the quill of the fossil feather; both were 3.5 millimetres. “This matches,” he said. “This says a feather of this size would be associated with a limb of this size.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was more, including a piece of a partly burned tree trunk with am­ber stuck to it. He showed me a photo of the amber seen through a micro­scope. Trapped inside were two impact particles—another landmark discovery, because the amber would have preserved their chemical composition. (All other tektites found from the impact, exposed to the elements for millions of years, have chemically changed.) He’d also found scores of beautiful examples of lonsdaleite, a hexagonal form of diamond that is associated with impacts; it forms when carbon in an asteroid is compressed so violently that it crystallizes into trillions of microscopic grains, which are blasted into the air and drift down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he showed me a photograph of a fossil jawbone; it belonged to the mammal he’d found in the burrow. “This is the jaw of Dougie,” he said. The bone was big for a Cretaceous mammal—three inches long—and almost complete, with a tooth. After my visit to Hell Creek, DePalma had removed the animal’s burrow intact, still encased in the block of sediment, and, with the help of some women who worked as cashiers at the Travel Center, in Bowman, hoisted it into the back of his truck. He believes that the jaw belonged to a marsupial that looked like a weasel. Using the tooth, he could conduct a stable-isotope study to find out what the animal ate—“what the menu was after the disaster,” he said. The rest of the mammal remains in the burrow, to be researched later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DePalma listed some of the other discoveries he’s made at the site: several flooded ant nests, with drowned ants still inside and some chambers packed with microtektites; a possible wasp burrow; another mammal ­burrow, with multiple tunnels and galleries; shark teeth; the thigh bone of a large sea turtle; at least three new fish species; a gigantic ginkgo leaf and a plant that was a relative of the banana; more than a dozen new species of animals and plants; and several other burrow types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the deposit, in a mixture of heavy gravel and tektites, DePalma identified the broken teeth and bones, including hatchling remains, of almost every dinosaur group known from Hell Creek, as well as pterosaur remains, which had previously been found only in layers far below the KT boundary. He found, intact, an unhatched egg containing an embryo—a fossil of immense research value. The egg and the other remains suggested that dinosaurs and major reptiles were probably not staggering into extinction on that fateful day. In one fell swoop, DePalma may have solved the three-metre problem and filled in the gap in the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;111&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 2013 field season, DePalma was convinced that the site had been created by an impact flood, but he lacked conclusive evidence that it was the KT impact. It was possible that it resulted from another giant asteroid strike that occurred at around the same time. “Extraordinary discoveries require extraordinary evidence,” he said. If his tektites shared the same geochemistry as tektites from the Chicxulub asteroid, he’d have a strong case. Deposits of Chicxulub tektites are rare; the best source, discovered in 1990, is a small outcrop in Haiti, on a cliff above a road cut. In late January, 2014, DePalma went there to gather tektites and sent them to an independent lab in Canada, along with tektites from his own site; the samples were analyzed at the same time, with the same equipment. The results indicated a near-perfect geochemical match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few years after DePalma’s discoveries, only a handful of scientists knew about them. One was David Burnham, DePalma’s thesis adviser at Kansas, who estimates that DePalma’s site will keep specialists busy for at least half a century. “Robert’s got so much stuff that’s unheard of,” Burnham told me. “Amber with tektites embedded in it—holy cow! The dinosaur feathers are crazy good, but the burrow makes your head reel.” In paleontology, the term &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lagerstätte&lt;/em&gt; refers to a rare type of fossil site with a large variety of specimens that are nearly perfectly preserved, a sort of fossilized ecosystem. “It will be a famous site,” Burnham said. “It will be in the textbooks. It is the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lagerstätte&lt;/em&gt; of the KT extinction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Smit, a paleontologist at Vrije University, in Amsterdam, and a world authority on the KT impact, has been helping DePalma analyze his results, and, like Burnham and Walter Alvarez, he is a co-author of a scientific paper that DePalma is publishing about the site. (There are eight other co-authors.) “This is really a major discovery,” Smit said. “It solves the question of whether dinosaurs went extinct at exactly that level or whether they declined before. And this is the first time we see direct victims.” I asked if the results would be controversial. “When I saw his data with the paddlefish, sturgeon, and ammonite, I think he’s right on the spot,” Smit said. “I am very sure he has a pot of gold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September of 2016, DePalma gave a brief talk about the discovery at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, in Colorado. He mentioned only that he had found a deposit from a KT flood that had yielded glass droplets, shocked minerals, and fossils. He had christened the site Tanis, after the ancient city in Egypt, which was featured in the 1981 film “Raiders of the Lost Ark” as the resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. In the real Tanis, archeologists found an inscription in three writing systems, which, like the Rosetta stone, was crucial in translating ancient Egyptian. DePalma hopes that his Tanis site will help decipher what happened on the first day after the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk, limited though it was, caused a stir. Kirk Cochran, a professor at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at Stony Brook University, in New York, recalled that when DePalma presented his findings there were gasps of amazement in the audience. Some scientists were wary. Kirk Johnson, the director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, told me that he knew the Hell Creek area well, having worked there since 1981. “My warning lights were flashing bright red,” he told me. “I was so skeptical after the talk I was convinced it was a fabrication.” Johnson, who had been mapping the KT layer in Hell Creek, said that his research indicated that Tanis was at least forty-five feet below the KT boundary and perhaps a hundred thousand years older. “If it’s what it’s said to be,” Johnson said, “it’s a fabulous discovery.” But he declared himself “uneasy” until he could see DePalma’s paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One prominent West Coast paleontologist who is an authority on the KT event told me, “I’m suspicious of the findings. They’ve been presented at meetings in various ways with various associated extraordinary claims. He could have stumbled on something amazing, but he has a reputation for making a lot out of a little.” As an example, he brought up DePalma’s paper on Dakotaraptor, which he described as “bones he basically collected, all in one area, some of which were part of a dinosaur, some of which were part of a turtle, and he put it all together as a skeleton of one animal.” He also objected to what he felt was excessive secrecy surrounding the Tanis site, which has made it hard for outside scientists to evaluate DePalma’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson, too, finds the lack of transparency, and the dramatic aspects of DePalma’s personality, unnerving. “There’s an element of showmanship in his presentation style that does not add to his credibility,” he said. Other paleontologists told me that they were leery of going on the record with criticisms of DePalma and his co-authors. All expressed a desire to see the final paper, which will be published next week, in the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, so that they could evaluate the data for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;90&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the G.S.A. talk, DePalma realized that his theory of what had happened at Tanis had a fundamental problem. The KT tsunami, even moving at more than a hundred miles an hour, would have taken many hours to travel the two thousand miles to the site. The rainfall of glass blobs, however, would have hit the area and stopped within about an hour after the impact. And yet the tektites fell into an active flood. The timing was all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not a paleontological question; it was a problem of geophysics and sedimentology. Smit was a sedimentologist, and another researcher whom DePalma shared his data with, Mark Richards, now of the University of Washington, was a geophysicist. At dinner one evening in Nagpur, India, where they were attending a conference, Smit and Richards talked about the problem, looked up a few papers, and later jotted down some rough calculations. It was immediately apparent to them that the KT tsunami would have arrived too late to capture the falling tektites; the wave would also have been too diminished by its long journey to account for the thirty-­five-foot rise of water at Tanis. One of them proposed that the wave might have been created by a curious phenomenon known as a seiche. In large earthquakes, the shaking of the ground sometimes causes water in ponds, swimming pools, and bathtubs to slosh back and forth. Richards recalled that the 2011 Japanese earthquake produced bizarre, five-foot seiche waves in an absolutely calm Norwegian fjord thirty minutes after the quake, in a place unreachable by the tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richards had previously estimated that the worldwide earthquake generated by the KT impact could have been a thousand times stronger than the biggest earthquake ever experienced in human history. Using that gauge, he calculated that potent seismic waves would have arrived at Tanis six minutes, ten minutes, and thirteen minutes after the impact. (Different types of seismic waves travel at different speeds.) The brutal shaking would have been enough to trigger a large seiche, and the first blobs of glass would have started to rain down seconds or minutes afterward. They would have continued to fall as the seiche waves rolled in and out, depositing layer upon layer of sediment and each time ­sealing the tektites in place. The Tanis site, in short, did not span the first day of the impact: it probably recorded the first hour or so. This fact, if true, renders the site even more fabulous than previously thought. It is almost beyond credibility that a precise geological transcript of the most important sixty minutes of Earth’s history could still exist millions of years later—a sort of high-speed, high-­resolution video of the event recorded in fine layers of stone. DePalma said, “It’s like finding the Holy Grail clutched in the bony fingers of Jimmy Hoffa, sitting on top of the Lost Ark.” If Tanis had been closer to or farther from the impact point, this beautiful coincidence of timing could not have happened. “There’s nothing in the world that’s ever been seen like this,” Richards told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-=-=-=&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day sixty-six million years ago, life on Earth almost came to a shattering end. The world that emerged after the impact was a much simpler place. When sunlight finally broke through the haze, it illuminated a hellish landscape. The oceans were empty. The land was covered with drifting ash. The forests were charred stumps. The cold gave way to extreme heat as a greenhouse effect kicked in. Life mostly consisted of mats of algae and growths of fungus: for years after the impact, the Earth was covered with little other than ferns. Furtive, ratlike mammals lived in the gloomy understory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But eventually life emerged and blossomed again, in new forms. The KT event continues to attract the interest of scientists in no small part because the ashen print it left on the planet is an existential reminder. “We wouldn’t be here talking on the phone if that meteorite hadn’t fallen,” Smit told me, with a laugh. DePalma agreed. For the first hundred million years of their existence, before the asteroid struck, mammals scurried about the feet of the dinosaurs, amounting to little. “But when the dinosaurs were gone it freed them,” DePalma said. In the next epoch, mammals underwent an explosion of adaptive radiation, evolving into a dazzling variety of forms, from tiny bats to gigantic titanotheres, from horses to whales, from fearsome creodonts to large-brained primates with hands that could grasp and minds that could see through time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can trace our origins back to that event,” DePalma said. “To actually be there at this site, to see it, to be connected to that day, is a special thing. This is the last day of the Cretaceous. When you go one layer up—the very next day—that’s the Paleocene, that’s the age of mammals, that’s our age.” ♦&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We moved our servers to Iceland</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/why-we-moved-our-servers-to-iceland</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;30 Mar 2019 - Adriaan van Rossum - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simpleanalytics/blog.simpleanalytics.io/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-30-why-we-moved-our-servers-to-iceland.md&quot;&gt;Help improve this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the founder of Simple Analytics, I have always been mindful for the need of trust and transparency for our customers. We would like to be held accountable for our customers needs, so they can sleep in peace. The choices we make has to be optimal, in terms of privacy, for the visitors and our customers. One of the crucial choices to consider was, choosing the location of our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19526521&quot;&gt;Join the discussion on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/flag-map-of-iceland.svg?v1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, we moved our servers gradually to Iceland. In this blog post, I’d like to explain how we’ve achieved that, and most importantly, why. It wasn’t an easy process and I would like to share our learnings. There are some technical parts in this article which I’ve tried to write in an understandable way, but forgive me if it’s too technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-moving-our-servers&quot;&gt;Why moving our servers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with our website being added to &lt;a href=&quot;https://easylist.to/&quot;&gt;EasyList&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a list with domain names which are used by popular ad-blockers. I asked why Simple Analytics was added because we don’t track visitors of our customers’ websites. We even &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/simpleanalytics/cdn.simpleanalytics.io/blob/fae87364ae6dc2e26827fb9438745a8ac0c8024d/hello.js#L41-L42&quot;&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt; the “Do Not Track” settings in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/easylist/easylist/pull/1855#issuecomment-440241758&quot;&gt;replied the following&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/easylist/easylist/pull/1855&quot;&gt;Pull Request on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] So if we keep blocking the companies that do good, and respect the privacy of the users, what kind of sign is it to just block those companies? I think it’s wrong and we shouldn’t put every company on the list just because they are sending a request. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/easylist/easylist/pull/1855#issuecomment-440251257&quot;&gt;a reply&lt;/a&gt; to my comment from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cassowary714&quot;&gt;@cassowary714&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone says what you are saying, but I don’t want to see my requests sent to a US company (in your case, Digital Ocean […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t like this reply at first, but after sharing it with my community, people pointed it out to me that he indeed was correct about the fact the US government is able to access the data of our users. At that time, our servers were indeed running on Digital Ocean and they could pull out our drive and read our data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/safe.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is somewhat technical so bear with me. You can make a stolen drive (or detached for whatever reason) unusable for others. This can be solved by encrypting the data on the drive which makes it very difficult to read the data for people without the encryption key &lt;em&gt;(Note: only Simple Analytics has this key).&lt;/em&gt; It would still be possible to get little parts of the data by physically reading out the memory of the server. Memory is easy explained as a type of a drive, which is small but super fast which allows the processor of the server to run efficiently. A server does not function without memory so we kind of need to trust the hosting provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenged me to think where to move our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-next-location&quot;&gt;Our next location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with some basic searches and I found a Wikipedia page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_and_surveillance_by_country#Reporters_Without_Borders&quot;&gt;Internet censorship and surveillance by country&lt;/a&gt;. It contains a list of “Enemies of the Internet” by the Reporters without Borders, a Paris-based international non-governmental organization that advocates freedom of the press, which classifies a country as an enemy of the internet when “all of these countries mark themselves out not just for their capacity to censor news and information online but also for their almost systematic repression of Internet users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from this list, there is an alliance called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes&quot;&gt;Five Eyes&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a. FVEY. It’s an alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In recent years, documents have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another’s citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on spying (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_under_Five_Eyes_surveillance#cite_ref-8&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;). The former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, described the FVEY as a “supra-national intelligence organization that doesn’t answer to the laws of its own countries.” There are other countries working together with the FVEY in other international cooperatives including Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden (so-called 14 Eyes). I couldn’t find evidence of the 14 Eyes alliance abusing their combined intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/server-down.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we were pretty sure not to use any of the listed countries from the “Enemies of the Internet” list and just to be sure to skip the countries on the 14 Eyes alliance list. For Simple Analytics, this gave enough reason to avoid those countries for storing the data of our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia page earlier mentioned reads the following for Iceland:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censorship is prohibited by the Icelandic Constitution and there is a strong tradition of protecting freedom of expression that extends to the use of the Internet. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iceland&quot;&gt;Iceland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researching the best country, privacy-wise, Iceland kept popping up. So I did some thorough research on Iceland. Please keep in mind that I don’t speak Icelandic which may have resulted in missing important information. &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.io/feedback&quot;&gt;Let us know&lt;/a&gt; if you have any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedomhouse.org/report/countries-net-freedom-2018&quot;&gt;Freedom on the Net 2018 report&lt;/a&gt; (from the Freedom House), Iceland together with Estonia scored a 6/100 (lower is better) on the Internet Freedom Score. This makes them the best privacy-friendly countries. Be aware that not every country has been rated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland is not a member of the European Union, although the country is part of the European Economic Area and has agreed to follow legislation regarding consumer protection and business law similar to other member states. This includes the Electronic Communications Act 81/2003 which implemented data retention requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law applies to telecommunication providers and mandates the retention of records for six months. It also states that companies may only deliver information on telecommunications in criminal cases or on matters of public safety and that such information may not be given to anyone other than the police or the public prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, Iceland is somewhat following the laws of the European Economic Area, it has its own approach to privacy. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/438&quot;&gt;Icelandic Data Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; encourages anonymity of user data. ISPs and content hosts are not held legally liable for the content that they host or transmit. According to Icelandic law, its not the domain name provider, but the registrant of an .is domain name that is responsible for ensuring the use of the domain is within the limits of the law (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isnic.is/en/domain/rules&quot;&gt;ISNIC&lt;/a&gt;). The government does not place any restrictions on anonymous communication and no registration is required when purchasing a SIM card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/world-line-sf-ams.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage from moving to Iceland is the climate and location of the country. Servers produce a lot of heat and while Reykjavík (Icelands capital where most data centers are located) is on average 40.41°F (4.67°C) it’s a great location to cool down the servers. Meaning that for each watt used to run servers, storage and network equipment, proportionally very little is used for cooling, lighting and other overhead. On top of that Iceland is the world’s largest green energy producer per capita and largest electricity producer per capita, with approximately 55,000 kWh per person per year. In comparison, the EU average is less than 6,000 kWh. Most hosting providers in Iceland get 100% of their electricity from renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you draw a straight line from San Francisco to Amsterdam you will cross Iceland. Simple Analytics has most customers from the US and Europe, so it makes sense to pick this geographical location. The privacy-friendly laws and the environmental friendly approach of Iceland made it even more easy for us to choose them as the new location for our servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-our-servers&quot;&gt;Moving our servers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we needed to find a hosting provider in Iceland. There are quite a few and it’s really hard to know if you have the best. We didn’t have the resources to try them all, so instead, we set up some automatic scripts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;) while setting up the server so we could easily move to another provider if we needed to. We choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://1984hosting.com/&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;, a company with the slogan “Safeguarding privacy and civil rights since 2006”. We liked that slogan and asked them a few questions about how they would handle our data. They reassured us and we proceeded installing our main server and they only use electricity from renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/server-status.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we hit a few roadblocks during this process. This section of the article is quite technical. Feel free to skip to the next. When you have an encrypted server you’ll need to unlock it with a private key. This key can’t be stored on the server as it defeats the purpose of encrypting. So if the key isn’t on the server you need to enter it remotely. That’s right, we need to enter the key when the server boots. Wait, but what happens with a power failure? Are all requests with page views to your server failing after a reboot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we added an extra server in front of the main server. This server is kind of stupid. It just receives the requests with page views and sends it directly to our main server. When the main server is failing it will store the requests in its own database and re-attemps those requests to the main server until it succeeds. So after a power failure, there is no data loss anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to booting up the server. When the encrypted main server boots we need to enter a password. But we don’t want to travel to Iceland or ask somebody there to enter it, for obvious reasons. To access a server remotely you usually use SSH. SSH - is a secure communication protocol, that most people use to communicate with their servers. SSH is a program which is accessible when a server or computer is running. But we needed it to connect before the server was completely started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we found &lt;a href=&quot;https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html&quot;&gt;Dropbear&lt;/a&gt;, a very small SSH program, that you can run via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk&quot;&gt;initial ramdisk&lt;/a&gt; (initramfs). This means we are able to allow external connections via SSH. We don’t have to fly to Iceland to boot our server, yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving our data from our old server to our new server in Iceland we were finally done. It took us a couple of weeks from start to end, but we are glad we did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;only-storing-the-data-you-need&quot;&gt;Only storing the data you need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Simple Analytics we live by the saying: “Only store data you need.” We only &lt;a href=&quot;http://simpleanalytics.io/what-we-collect&quot;&gt;collect&lt;/a&gt; the minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s common practice to &lt;a href=&quot;http://abstraction.blog/2015/06/28/soft-vs-hard-delete&quot;&gt;soft delete&lt;/a&gt; data in applications. This means that the data is not really deleted but it’s made inaccessible by the end user. We don’t do this, if you delete your data, it’s gone from our database. We use hard delete. &lt;em&gt;Note: it will be in our encrypted backups for a maximum of 90 days. In case of a bug we can retrieve this data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have delete_at fields ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For customers, it’s important to know what data is kept and what is deleted. When somebody deletes their data we show them &lt;a href=&quot;https://simpleanalytics.io/deleted&quot;&gt;a page with exactly that&lt;/a&gt;. We delete the user and their analytics from our database. We also delete the credit card and email from Stripe (our payment provider). We keep the payment history, which is needed for taxes and keep our log files and database backups for 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;limit-height&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/images/personal-data.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: If you only store little sensitive data, what’s the need for all this protection and extra security?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we want to be the best privacy focused analytics company in the world. We will do everything within our power to deliver the best analytics tools without invading the privacy of your visitors. By even protecting our massive amounts of unidentifiable information about visitors we want to show we take privacy super seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-next&quot;&gt;What is next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we improved the privacy of our platform we noticed a slight increase in loading time for our embed scripts.

<title>Apple Cancels AirPower Product</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has canceled the AirPower product completely, citing difficulty meeting its own standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After much effort, we’ve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project. We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward,” said Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering in an emailed statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;After a delay of over a year since it was first announced in September of 2017, the AirPower charging mat has become something of a focal point for Apple’s recent habit of announcing envelope tickling products and not actually shipping them on time. The AirPods, famously, had a bit of a delay before becoming widely available, and were shipped in limited quantities before finally hitting their stride and becoming a genuine cultural moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;AirPower, however, has had far more time to marinate in the soup of public opinion since it was announced. Along with recent MacBook keyboard troubles, this has functioned as a sort of flash point over discussion that something isn’t right with Apple’s hardware processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Everything I’ve personally heard (Apple is saying nothing officially) about the AirPower delay has been related to tough engineering problems related to the laws of physics. Specifically, I’ve heard that they ran too hot because the 3D charging coils in close proximity to one another required very, very cautious power management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;7.5405405405405&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;9.2162162162162&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Always worth reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gruber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gruber&lt;/a&gt;’s show recaps. The AirPower situation is real – heat is a problem and it was shown off too early. Sometimes Apple does this and eng rises to the challenge and delivers. Sometimes, physics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2YNlpPO1qO&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2YNlpPO1qO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1041363624755781638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Obviously, it would do Apple very little good to release a charging mat that caused devices to overheat, perhaps even to the point of damage. So, it has canceled the project. If you know more about this, feel free to reach out, I’m fascinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;There have been other scenarios where Apple has pushed the hardware envelope hard and managed to pull it off and ship them, the iPhone 7 Plus, its first with a twin-lens system, being one that jumps to mind. Apple had a fallback plan in a single-lens version but at some point had to commit and step off a ledge to get it done in time to ship — even though knowing they still had problems to solve. Apple has done this many times over the years, but has managed to ship a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;AirPower, however, was the other kind of case. The project was apparently canceled so recently that boxes of the new AirPod cases &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1111629174593208322&quot;&gt;even have pictures of AirPower&lt;/a&gt; on them and the new AirPod sets have mentions of AirPower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very, very rare public misstep for Apple. Never, throughout the discussion about when AirPower might be released, did the overall trend of the discussion lean toward “never.” That’s a testament to the ability of its hardware engineering teams to consistently execute features that seemed to be nearly impossible over the years. In this case, it appears that the engineering issues have proven, at least at this point, insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that hardware is, well, hard. The basic concepts of wireless charging are well known and established, but by promising the ability to place multiple devices anywhere on a pad, allowing them to charge simultaneously while communicating charge levels and rates, Apple set its bar incredibly high for AirPower. Too high, in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Everything I know about freelancing</title>
<link>https://andyadams.org/everything-i-know-about-freelancing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://andyadams.org/everything-i-know-about-freelancing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably read a lot about freelancing: Feast and famine. Where to find clients. How much to charge. These topics are fundamental, but it seems like most freelancers burn out before they get over these hurdles. Can freelancing be a stable, long-term career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so! I’ve been freelancing for 7 years, which is long enough to have survived lots of ups, downs, and evolutions of my business. Certainly Software has grown 5x in those years, and has gone from literally &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/andyadams.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/andy-the-barn.jpg');&quot; href=&quot;https://andyadams.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/andy-the-barn.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;starting in a barn loft (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;starting in a barn loft&lt;/a&gt; to now having a ground-level office in a much nicer barn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I getting the hang of it? Maybe! Or is the market just uber hot, so schmucks like me can’t miss? Probably! Either way, I’ve learned quite a bit over the years through pain, success, and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is everything I’ve learned, loosely grouped by topic. I was very much inspired by Jason Cohen’s &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/blog.asmartbear.com/kung-fu.html');&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.asmartbear.com/kung-fu.html&quot;&gt;Kung Fu post&lt;/a&gt;. This is my style of freelancing kung fu – other freelancers have different styles. Maybe something here will work for you, maybe not. Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/codepen.io/andyadams/pen/jJgNqQ');&quot; href=&quot;https://codepen.io/andyadams/pen/jJgNqQ&quot;&gt;on codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Billing and Rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most challenging part about freelancing is not technical, it’s growing the business. Spend your time and set your rates accordingly. 50% of your time on business development is not too much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t bill hourly. Bill by day or by week. Billing a daily rate allows you to avoid &lt;em&gt;wasting&lt;/em&gt; time &lt;em&gt;tracking&lt;/em&gt; time, and makes it a lot easier to focus on 1 project at a time. Estimates are also much easier to make in daily increments. The exception is retainers: Those can be hourly, but charge accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can specialize simply in charging more (thanks &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9382380');&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9382380&quot;&gt;tptacek&lt;/a&gt;). Imagine two projects which are effectively the same work, except one has a budget 10x the other. Specialize in the 10x projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do some projects have 10x the budget? Sometimes it’s just because the client has more money. But mostly: Larger companies can’t afford (the risks associated with) cheap freelancers. “You get what you pay for” applies to freelancers as well, which is why large companies will prefer larger, established agencies even though they cost &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your finely-calculated estimate and 3x it, both in time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should get really comfortable with “no”; Both saying “no” to bad fits, and hearing “no” from clients who can’t afford you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably undercharging. &lt;strong&gt;Charge more&lt;/strong&gt; (thanks &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twitter.com/patio11');&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patio11&quot;&gt;patio11&lt;/a&gt;), but also &lt;strong&gt;be at peace&lt;/strong&gt; if you’re making enough right now. It’s easy to excessively worry about leaving money on the table. Everyone does it. There’s always a next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High rates have a compounding benefit.&lt;br/&gt;Low rates = more time working = less time selling = low rates.&lt;br/&gt;High rates = less time working = more time selling = higher rates.&lt;br/&gt;Raising your rates allows you more time to focus on raising your rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save a little time each month for emergency projects, and charge accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need help determining rates, find the highest-paying job you could realistically get (regardless of location) and charge more than that. &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/andyadams.org/you-can-charge-more/');&quot; href=&quot;https://andyadams.org/you-can-charge-more/&quot;&gt;Here’s a formula I came up with for this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be shocked at how much money large companies spend on simple static websites or CRUD apps that are often mediocre and/or thrown away. Similarly, you’d be shocked on how much money companies spend on consultants for advice, only to not implement (or even read!) the recommendations they’re given because the consultants half-assed it. You can do better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about budget early in the conversation. It’s sometimes uncomfortable, but you’ll save everyone lots of time by determining if you’re even in the same ballpark. You won’t lose good contracts by talking about budget, and you shouldn’t be afraid of scaring away low-budget clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t get PTO, so it will feel like you’re losing money when you take a vacation. It’s strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always bill, even for small fixes. If you work for free, you are setting expectations for clients and they will take advantage of the freebies. On the flip side, you can do favors for long-term clients if you know they won’t try to exploit you. Don’t nickel &amp;amp; dime the client that is giving you 50% of your work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are freelancers and consultants making $3,000+ per day doing basic marketing consulting, building simple websites and CRUD apps, or configuring servers – stuff that you could do, too. There are also freelancers and consultants making $100/day for almost the same work. The difference is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;wp-block-table aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-rate Freelancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-rate freelancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Find clients who can’t afford cheapness&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Find clients who can’t afford quality&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Focus on clients’ pain points&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Focus on the technical details&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Charge more, forcing low-pay clients out&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Charge less, accepting lowballers as clients&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sell their talents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hope people notice their talents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;Take ownership of their projects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Do their part, and no more&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning how to move to high-rate freelancing is part experience, part simply having the guts to charge more and hear “no” from clients. High-rate freelancers have learned the business value of what they provide. If you freelance long enough and are observant, you’ll learn what matters &amp;amp; what doesn’t matter to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it as easy as possible for clients to pay. Don’t get hung up trying to save 3% credit card processing fees! Do whatever it takes to smooth the process of them paying you, including registering on their wacky billing system if needs be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collect payment (50% – 100%) before starting work, particularly for new clients you’re not comfortable with. You can make exceptions for large or repeat clients whom you’re confident will pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect late payments. Don’t hesitate to politely nag, they probably just forgot. The squeaky wheel gets greased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your clients won’t realize they’ll need maintenance on their project unless you tell them. Include maintenance as part of every proposal, lest the client spends their whole budget on building the first version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you’re independent and can build things, “idea” people are going to come to you all the time with partnership proposals. Feel free to listen, but 99% of these are worthless – particularly if you’ve only just met the person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/codepen.io/andyadams/pen/gENmaM');&quot; href=&quot;https://codepen.io/andyadams/pen/gENmaM&quot;&gt;on codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients generally fall into 2 buckets: “Price-isn’t-a-big-concern” and “extremely-price-sensitive”. It’s all in how the client views their project: Is it a profit-center or cost-center? I’ve found very little middle ground. Identify the high-value clients, and focus your business on them exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing like in-person meetings to strengthen relationships. That being said, I’ve only met ~3 of my dozens of clients in person, so it’s not utterly critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to like the people you work with, but it sure helps. My best clients have been the ones I’ve had good personal connections with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incomplete list of red flags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a potential client tells you &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; something should be implemented, they don’t want you to think too much and don’t value your expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a client previously posted their projects to Fiverr or UpWork, it’s a signal they don’t value expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a client won’t listen to your advice because something is not your speciality, they probably see you as an implementer, not a partner. You probably sold yourself short and/or the client doesn’t value you like they should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a client tells you how long a project should take you to finish, they think they know an awful lot about your field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a potential client can’t explain why they chose you to talk to (i.e. for your expertise, because of an article they read, because of a referral, etc), they’re probably shopping around and you’re bidding against other contractors. This isn’t the worst thing in the world, but you’ll have minimal leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a client starts asking for detailed breakdowns of your time spent when they haven’t asked in the past, you’re probably being viewed as too expensive and should brace for an end or change to the relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to speak up if you know something better than your client – even if it’s not necessarily what they’re paying for. Just be sure you actually know what you’re talking about, and take time to craft your message to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t pretend to know stuff you don’t actually know. You’re not good at BSing, and BSers lose credibility really fast. Instead, don’t be afraid to say “I’m not sure, but I’ll do some research and find out”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first interactions with anyone will set the tone for the rest of the relationship. If you &lt;em&gt;crush&lt;/em&gt; the first emails, phone calls, or meetings, your reputation will be solidified for the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify your “champion” within larger organizations – someone who will advocate for you. They are worth a lot – do them favors and you’ll find your invoices will get paid faster, more work will come your way, and you’ll have staying power within the organization. Often this person is the one who benefits most from your work or someone who felt the most pain before you came along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be kind &amp;amp; professional to everyone you interact with at a client, even if they’re not your main point of contact. Remember names. Sure, it’s a good thing to do in general, but it helps business as well: People move to new companies and will recommend you. Never never never never burn bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/codepen.io/andyadams/pen/NJQWRW');&quot; href=&quot;https://codepen.io/andyadams/pen/NJQWRW&quot;&gt;on codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you specialize, specialize in a type of customer rather than a technology. Think “specialist in accounting departments for manufacturing companies” instead of “specialist in the Quickbooks API”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portfolios are probably helpful, but I’ve been successful beyond my wildest dreams without ever having a portfolio. I provided links to my work via email, when necessary. If you’re interested in building a portfolio, I found this &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/shoptalkshow.com/episodes/329-dan-mall-building-portfolio/');&quot; href=&quot;https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/329-dan-mall-building-portfolio/&quot;&gt;ShopTalkShow with Dan Mall valuable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “I’m not a fit” once can save several months of agony on a project you never should have started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fame or notoriety isn’t necessary to be successful. It’s easy to look at the outliers and think “well of course you can charge $X000/day, you’re &lt;em&gt;famous&lt;/em&gt;“, but there are lots of random developers you’ve never heard of doing routine stuff making $6000+/week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referrals are #1 source of leads for basically every freelancer, followed by writing &amp;amp; job boards. Build rapport with clients, and you’ll fill up your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job boards &amp;amp; premium marketplaces (such as &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.toptal.com/');&quot; href=&quot;https://www.toptal.com/&quot;&gt;TopTal&lt;/a&gt;) are good places to establish yourself when you’re getting started. Postings on job boards get 98% garbage responses, so take time to do a good job on applying to postings and you’ll see success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re starting out, I’d recommend picking a skill that is in widespread demand, but might be slightly boring or even lower-pay. This can help you establish a baseline of work while you’re figuring out what you want to specialize in. I wrote a &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/andyadams.org/successful-wordpress-freelancing/');&quot; href=&quot;https://andyadams.org/successful-wordpress-freelancing/&quot;&gt;book about using WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose, but there’s lots of other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to keep a mental model of your ideal client in mind. If you don’t think about your ideal client regularly, you’ll find yourself drifting into whatever project comes along. Having a particular customer in mind helps focus your marketing &amp;amp; sales efforts, and allows you to say “not a fit” more often. (Thanks &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.gkogan.co/');&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/&quot;&gt;Greg Kogan&lt;/a&gt; for asking me who my ideal client is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A helpful way to determine what exactly you’re specializing in is to fill in the blanks: “I’m _______, an expert in _______ helping _______ _______. Unlike my competition, I _______.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: “I’m Andy, an expert in WordPress helping Marketing Departments of Software Companies manage and extend WordPress. Unlike my competition, I’m an experienced developer who understands SEO, content marketing, and design, and I don’t disappear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a little bit about your expertise &amp;amp; doing a bit of self-promotion will almost certainly bring you clients, sometimes from the places you least expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy and read &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/doubleyourfreelancing.com/rate/');&quot; href=&quot;https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/rate/&quot;&gt;Double Your Freelancing Rate&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth it. Or, if you can’t afford it, just double your rate anyways and then pay Brennan for writing such a good title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freelancers who deliver projects and don’t disappear approach ∞ value for agencies, because agencies naturally have ups &amp;amp; downs that are really hard to fill with full-time staff. Having someone they can plug in to specific projects is an absolute joy for their project managers, and there are shockingly few freelancers who do a good job at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working as a subcontractor is a great way to learn the business of freelancing, particularly if you’re working for an agency. Pay close attention to how agencies manage contracts, clients, relationships – all the business bits. Subcontracting can be a great fallback for dry spells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve learned how agencies work, move on to finding your own clients. Working as a subcontractor means you’re not capturing all of the value you deliver. Move to direct client relationships ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t work on promises. Get projects down on paper with clear terms, and have your clients sign. Until you do so, all the talk in the world is worthless. Amazing how many times I had to learn this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/codepen.io/andyadams/pen/aMeogW');&quot; href=&quot;https://codepen.io/andyadams/pen/aMeogW&quot;&gt;on codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing the Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you underbid a project, suck it up and complete it. If that’s not possible, be frank with client and give them an exit plan. They’ll probably respond well. &lt;strong&gt;Do not disappear&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most clients &lt;strong&gt;don’t&lt;/strong&gt; care about code quality, period. Write quality code anyways, time permitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, don’t be afraid to whip something together if timelines are short and it’s likely to change later. &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html');&quot; href=&quot;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html&quot;&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt; and all that. Over-engineering can sink projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the right time to craft code vs. move fast is an extremely valuable meta skill for software developers that can only be learned through difficult experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should absolutely &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; the work. When in doubt, go above and beyond. You’ll regret the times when you do the minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d estimate over half of freelancers disappear before delivering their projects. Good for you: Finish your projects and you’re already in the 51st percentile of freelancers. Being reliable is a rare virtue, seemingly across all industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Break large projects up into 4-6 week chunks. This protects you in case of overruns, allows you to slowly build trust with the client, and allows easy pivots in case the project needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to keep up with technology trends while freelancing. Clients pay for efficient, completed projects, which are (typically) best done with stable technologies that you’re very proficient with. If you want to keep up, you have to figure out ways to learn – either on the job (in tiny bits – I’d never experiment with big things on a meaningful client project) or on your own time. Alternatively, you can stick with your toolset and accept that the world is moving past you for now. There are still mainframe developers out there, making a killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a quiet office and a consistent schedule. Chaos in your work life leads to chaos in your personal life. Set boundaries with your family if you need to. Be nice about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the portion of the day where you’re most productive, and schedule your deep technical work for that time. For me, it’s the first 3-4 hours of the day. Save the rest of the time for emails, administrative work, and other less-demanding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resist the temptation to overbook. You’ll always think you can handle it, and you almost never can. Overbooking leads to slippage across all projects and you’ll probably need a break afterwards – negating the whole point of overbooking since you’re losing time taking a break. Consistent, stable and repeatable hours beats long days &amp;amp; hard pushes in just about every way measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value you provide will be &amp;gt; 50% communication, &amp;lt; 50% technical. This is probably true of full-time jobs as well, but in freelancing your ability to communicate requirements, project schedules, and sales pitches will have a tremendous impact on your success. Get really good at email in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time estimation for projects is hard, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking it’s impossible. You can get good at it, and the only way to get good at it is to try, fail, and learn from your mistakes. Start by taking your initial estimates and 3xing them, and learn from there. Jacques Mattheij &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/jacquesmattheij.com/be-consultant/estimating/');&quot; href=&quot;https://jacquesmattheij.com/be-consultant/estimating/&quot;&gt;wrote a nice starter article for doing estimates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a client gives you a design to implement, make your implementation pixel-perfect. It’s crazy how sloppy some developers are; the client put together that PSD for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-money&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/codepen.io/andyadams/pen/vPoYxQ');&quot; href=&quot;https://codepen.io/andyadams/pen/vPoYxQ&quot;&gt;on codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a tool if it saves you 30 minutes. Purchases under $50 should be instant. Spending $ on books should also be a no-brainer. For $20, if a book gives you an idea to get 1 more client, it’s paid for itself 100x (thanks &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/blogmaverick.com/');&quot; href=&quot;http://blogmaverick.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt;). Get a good mic &amp;amp; webcam if you’re remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your hourly rate as a lens to evaluate your actions. Are you spending 2 hours shopping around to save $50 when you bill $200/hour? Seems silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, beware big-ticket items that won’t materially affect your business: Things like super high-powered computers, audio equipment, fancy furniture, etc, can blow your budget fast without making much difference to how you work. Be judicious on big purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build at least 2 months savings, probably more, because you’re going to have a dry spell from time-to-time. &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/classic.youneedabudget.com/support/article/rule-four-live-on-last-months-income');&quot; href=&quot;https://classic.youneedabudget.com/support/article/rule-four-live-on-last-months-income&quot;&gt;Live on last month’s income&lt;/a&gt; to help mitigate any slowdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need 2 years of tax returns before traditional lenders will lend for things like a mortgage. You can make big $$$, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t have a W2 job. Plan accordingly – if you want to get a mortgage in the short term, do it while you still have a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business finances are different than personal finances. This is weird, but true: Spending money on your business nets you more money. Spending money on your personal life nets you less money. You can’t treat business spending like personal spending, particularly if you’re a tightwad with your personal money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until you’re sure of your effective tax rate, set aside a minimum of 25% of every dollar you earn for the tax man. Put it away, don’t touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do business as an LLC, always referencing your LLC in contracts. Be sure payments are paid to your LLC. &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/stripe.com/atlas');&quot; href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt; seems like a good way to get started, but depending on your state an LLC might be easy to set up just by filling the forms yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Errors &amp;amp; Omissions insurance (which insures in case you screw something up) is difficult to find for software. The contracts I’ve found were so full of holes an ambiguity I personally found them useless. For insurers, software is still viewed a bit of a wild west, probably due to the fact that the industry is, in fact, a wild west. I hope someone proves me wrong and shows me a good insurer for freelance software devs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to insurance and costly mistakes: When writing code that could bill variable external services (like AWS or variable ad spends), be really really stinking careful. I’ve heard horror stories: The &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/medium.com/@wilreynolds/the-200-000-mistake-what-we-learned-8cd6d3e21806?_branch_match_id=511942033696607060#---0-205');&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@wilreynolds/the-200-000-mistake-what-we-learned-8cd6d3e21806?_branch_match_id=511942033696607060#---0-205&quot;&gt;$200k overspend by Wil Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; is one, and I’ve heard of a developer accidentally sending massive amounts of video to a video-processing service, resulting in ~$100k of expenses that he was then sued for. Really stinking careful. Test and test again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/codepen.io/andyadams/pen/bZPqMa');&quot; href=&quot;https://codepen.io/andyadams/pen/bZPqMa&quot;&gt;on codepen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miscellaneous and wonderings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people debate what you should call yourself: Freelancer, Con$ultant, or Contractor. You should probably stick with “Consultant”, but what matters more is that you position yourself as a high-value &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt;. The easiest way to do that is to raise your rates. &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/');&quot; href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/&quot;&gt;Don’t call yourself a programmer&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in being an official consultant, &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/daedtech.com/software-consulting/');&quot; href=&quot;https://daedtech.com/software-consulting/&quot;&gt;DaedTech is a great place to read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of freelancing advice on the internet. Much of it is absolute garbage and will lead you into despair. Sometimes, you’ll see advice from high-value consultants that will make no sense in your current situation. Internalize the lesson and hold onto it in your memory. When you find the client/job that it applies to, you’ll have a wonderful “aha” moment. Example: &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/doubleyourfreelancing.com/pre-roadmapping/');&quot; href=&quot;https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/pre-roadmapping/&quot;&gt;Paid roadmapping sessions&lt;/a&gt; made no sense to me early in my career – who would pay to get a scope document?! These days I’m encountering projects where it makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time (maybe forever), you won’t feel like you have a “real” job, and many of your friends and family won’t think you do, either. Don’t worry, there’s a lot of us freelancers out there and if you’re making it, you’re not only legit – you’re running a &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt;, baby. I think you’re an entrepreneur or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a fancy office, expensive equipment, or flashy business cards doesn’t make you legit. Getting work done and getting paid for it makes you legit. Don’t mix up the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your kids will be surprised that other mommies &amp;amp; daddies go to work for &lt;em&gt;just one&lt;/em&gt; company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets pretty dang lonely sometimes, particularly if you’re working remotely. I don’t care if you’re an introvert or extrovert, it’ll affect you either way. You won’t be a regular part of a larger team, so you’ll miss out on water cooler conversations and team building. Having virtual coffees with freelancers in a similar position can help fight the loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make friends with your “competitors”. Reliable freelancers are overbooked and can provide leads when they overflow, plus they can be a great resource when you’re stuck on something. The WordPress community is phenomenal in this regard – lots of “frenemies” everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freelancing can be scary when you think about your future career prospects. You’re not in a traditional track, and it’s hard for me to envision transitioning to a “regular” software job after 10 years of being solo, just from the perspective of “do I have the right skills to fit into a larger company?”. I don’t know of a way to mitigate this fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downsides of freelancing, compared to full-time jobs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’ll spend a lot of time on non-technical things, which is lame if you like programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a bad day means you might not get paid for that day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less experimenting – if you’re doing it right, you’ll be doing similar projects with ruthless efficiency over and over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No PTO, and nobody to cover for you when you take a vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lonely by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No “tracks” of advancement. You’re on your own to figure out what’s next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upsides of freelancing, compared to full-time jobs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work when you want. Do your errands midday or take your kids for spontaneous trips to the park. This may be the best part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see what makes businesses successful – both your own and clients’ businesses. This is a life skill that most people never learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want some extra spending money? Take on a new project, and it’s yours!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No “tracks” of advancement. You’re on your own to figure out what’s next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re going to yearn for a full-time job sometimes. I don’t think this ever goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a separate work phone &amp;amp; email. Put them away when you’re not working, or you’ll find yourself working at all hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to work in your pajamas, and I recommend doing so once in a while. But for maximum productivity, your routine should involve getting dressed, brushing your teeth, and treating it like a “real job”. Pretty yourself up even if nobody sees you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is what I’ve learned so far.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe it will work for you, maybe not. Take whatever bits &amp;amp; pieces you like and apply them to your business. I’ve probably forgotten a lot of important stuff. If you think something is wrong or missing, leave a &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19522053');&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19522053&quot;&gt;comment on HN&lt;/a&gt; or email me: &lt;a onclick=&quot;javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/mailto/andy@certainly.software');&quot; href=&quot;mailto:andy@certainly.software&quot;&gt;andy@certainly.software&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Hi Gabor,

I am the original author of GNU grep.  I am also a FreeBSD user,
although I live on -stable (and older) and rarely pay attention
to -current.

However, while searching the -current mailing list for an unrelated
reason, I stumbled across some flamage regarding BSD grep vs GNU grep
performance.  You may have noticed that discussion too...

Anyway, just FYI, here's a quick summary of where GNU grep gets
its speed.  Hopefully you can carry these ideas over to BSD grep.

#1 trick: GNU grep is fast because it AVOIDS LOOKING AT
EVERY INPUT BYTE.

#2 trick: GNU grep is fast because it EXECUTES VERY FEW
INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH BYTE that it *does* look at.

GNU grep uses the well-known Boyer-Moore algorithm, which looks
first for the final letter of the target string, and uses a lookup
table to tell it how far ahead it can skip in the input whenever
it finds a non-matching character.

GNU grep also unrolls the inner loop of Boyer-Moore, and sets up
the Boyer-Moore delta table entries in such a way that it doesn't
need to do the loop exit test at every unrolled step.  The result
of this is that, in the limit, GNU grep averages fewer than 3 x86
instructions executed for each input byte it actually looks at
(and it skips many bytes entirely).

See &quot;Fast String Searching&quot;, by Andrew Hume and Daniel Sunday,
in the November 1991 issue of Software Practice &amp;amp; Experience, for
a good discussion of Boyer-Moore implementation tricks.  It's
available as a free PDF online.

Once you have fast search, you'll find you also need fast input.

GNU grep uses raw Unix input system calls and avoids copying data
after reading it.

Moreover, GNU grep AVOIDS BREAKING THE INPUT INTO LINES.  Looking
for newlines would slow grep down by a factor of several times,
because to find the newlines it would have to look at every byte!

So instead of using line-oriented input, GNU grep reads raw data into
a large buffer, searches the buffer using Boyer-Moore, and only when
it finds a match does it go and look for the bounding newlines.
(Certain command line options like -n disable this optimization.)

Finally, when I was last the maintainer of GNU grep (15+ years ago...),
GNU grep also tried very hard to set things up so that the *kernel*
could ALSO avoid handling every byte of the input, by using mmap()
instead of read() for file input.  At the time, using read() caused
most Unix versions to do extra copying.  Since GNU grep passed out
of my hands, it appears that use of mmap became non-default, but you
can still get it via --mmap.  And at least in cases where the data
is already file system buffer caches, mmap is still faster:

  $ time sh -c 'find . -type f -print | xargs grep -l 123456789abcdef'
  real  0m1.530s
  user  0m0.230s
  sys   0m1.357s
  $ time sh -c 'find . -type f -print | xargs grep --mmap -l 123456789abcdef'
  real  0m1.201s
  user  0m0.330s
  sys   0m0.929s

[workload was a 648 megabyte MH mail folder containing 41000 messages]
So even nowadays, using --mmap can be worth a &amp;gt;20% speedup.

Summary:

- Use Boyer-Moore (and unroll its inner loop a few times).

- Roll your own unbuffered input using raw system calls.  Avoid copying
  the input bytes before searching them.  (Do, however, use buffered
  *output*.  The normal grep scenario is that the amount of output is
  small compared to the amount of input, so the overhead of output
  buffer copying is small, while savings due to avoiding many small
  unbuffered writes can be large.)

- Don't look for newlines in the input until after you've found a match.

- Try to set things up (page-aligned buffers, page-sized read chunks,
  optionally use mmap) so the kernel can ALSO avoid copying the bytes.

The key to making programs fast is to make them do practically nothing. ;-)

Regards,

        Mike

<title>Dogs demonstrate the existence of an epileptic seizure odour in humans</title>
<link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Ethics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study received approval by the institutional review board of OHS de Lorraine for collection techniques used to obtain odour samples from patients with epilepsy. All institutional (Medical Mutts) and published guidelines (Assistance Dogs International) for the use of positive reinforcement in the care and use of the dogs were followed. The Animal Ethics Committee of Rennes was consulted for this study and confirmed there was no need to request an authorization for this research, since it did not affect dog welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present research was non-invasive and did not involve pharmacological interventions. Hence, in accordance with the Ethics Committee’s guidelines, parents gave only an informed written consent to allow the child’s participation in the experiment prior to their inclusion in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Subjects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five trained dogs participated in this study (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-track-action=&quot;supplementary material anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4#MOESM1&quot;&gt;S2&lt;/a&gt;). All subjects lived in Medical Mutts facilities (USA) and had never been exposed to the experimental five patient odours. Medical Mutts selected dogs from shelters to be trained by professional trainers as service dogs. Selection criteria included temperament traits compatible for service dog training&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 40&quot; title=&quot;Haverbeke, A., Laporte, B., Depiereux, E., Giffroy, J.-M. &amp;amp; Diederich, C.

Sci. 113, 110&amp;#x2013;122 (2008).&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4#ref-CR40&quot; id=&quot;ref-link-section-d10732e1130&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and physical aptitudes. Dogs are trained for obedience for certification for public access in addition to scent discrimination. Dogs spent one hour per day, five days per week in a training session&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 15&quot; title=&quot;Hardin, D. S., Anderson, W. &amp;amp; Cattet, J. Dogs Can Be Successfully Trained to Alert to Hypoglycemia Samples from Patients with Type 1 Diabetes. Diabetes Ther. 6, 509&amp;#x2013;517 (2015).&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4#ref-CR15&quot; id=&quot;ref-link-section-d10732e1134&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Odour samples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were recruited in the Healthcare Centre OHS Flavigny, Flavigny sur Moselle, France. Ten participants were initially invited to participate after medical recommendations. One declined and the other 4 did not experience a seizure through the sample collection time of one week in December 2017. Thus, odours were collected from 5 females who were residents of the Healthcare Centre OHS. All had a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy (See Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-track-action=&quot;supplementary material anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4#MOESM1&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt;) and none experienced psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (exclusive or in addition to epileptic seizures) were actually a factor of exclusion when recruiting patients on the basis of their medical diagnosis. Since they all lived in a medicalized structure at the time of the sampling, the diagnosis was further confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They received the same food without dietary restrictions. Since the seizures could be experienced at any time, the collection of epilepsy seizure samples could occur randomly at any time (night or day), whereas all other samples were collected during day. Patients were not given any specific recommendation (e.g. regarding hormonal contraception, perfume, smoking etc.), so as to maintain an “ecological” individual variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Odour sampling procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three types of samples were collected: (a) a “seizure sample”, collected during or right after (&amp;lt;5 min) an ictal event; (b) a “physical exercise sample”, collected right after (&amp;lt;5 min) moderate exercise (defined as 1 min during which the patient ran approximately 30 m, and did leg and arm movements as step-touch and punches). Physical exercise samples served as control for movements or arousal that can be made or experienced during a seizure&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 41&quot; title=&quot;King, J. et al.

And (c) a “day sample” was collected at a pseudo-random moment during calm activity (e.g. drawing, paper crafting) in day time. The non-seizure samples were collected a minimum of 6 hours before or after a seizure in order to avoid a pre- or post-ictal collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each patient, two physical exercise samples were collected on two different days and four day samples on four different days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odour collection was performed in accordance with the procedure used at Medical Mutts for training assistance dogs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 15&quot; title=&quot;Hardin, D.

The cotton pad was then placed into a zip-locked bag (Ziplock brand, SC Johnson, Racine, WI, USA) and the patient was instructed to exhale into the bag before sealing it. Two cotton pads were collected from each patient, for each of the 7 types of odour. Each bag was labelled with the patient’s initials, day and time of collection and the corresponding odour type (normal, physical exercise or seizure). The samples were stored in the freezer (Temperature −12 °C) then shipped from France to USA at ambient temperature and stored again in the freezer until use (average of 47 days, SD = 18). Freezing has been shown to preserve samples of human body odour without altering perceptions of these odours and freeze–thaw cycles to not affect sample quality&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 43&quot; title=&quot;Lenochova, P., Roberts, S.

&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dogs that participated in the study were trained using positive reinforcement methods [12, 13]. They underwent the general training for assistance dog (30 commands, staying under control in public areas, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the training for SAD required three main steps. First a positive association is created between the scent of a seizure and treats in order to induce a conditioned emotional response. Then the dog learns to go to the scent and to stand still above it. This indication behaviour (dog standing above the scent) is developed by adding distance and duration and using the command “Check”. The second step consisted in a discrimination task, for additional scents (distractors, inter-ictal scent) were progressively added and the dog learned to only indicate the seizure scent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third phase of training, the seizure scent was placed on a person. The ‘stay-stand’ indication was replaced by teaching the dog to alert by a poke of the nose on the person’s body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odours used for training were not from the patients. Therefore, the dogs included in the present study were completely unfamiliar with these particuliar odours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Experimental Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests took place from January 2018 to February 2018, in a closed room (9.1 × 6.1 m, 4 m high, 21 °C in average) (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-track-action=&quot;supplementary material anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4#MOESM1&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;) in the training facility. No experimenter was present in the testing room during a trial (see also&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 15&quot; title=&quot;Hardin, D. S., Anderson, W. &amp;amp; Cattet, J. Dogs Can Be Successfully Trained to Alert to Hypoglycemia Samples from Patients with Type 1 Diabetes. Diabetes Ther. 6, 509&amp;#x2013;517 (2015).&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4#ref-CR15&quot; id=&quot;ref-link-section-d10732e1214&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Experimenter was in a room nearby, separated from the first one by a wooden door. One camera was linked to a monitoring system, and another recorded the trials. At the beginning of a trial, the room was open, the trainer gave the command (“Check”), then closed the door and stayed out of view or reach in the second room. The dog was free to explore the experimental set-up until the correct identification of the seizure sample. It was then rewarded with a treat from an automatic dispenser remotely activated by the trainer (Pet Tutor®). Then the trainer opened the door and called the dog out of the room. The dog stayed in the second room in between two trials, while the experimenter changed the samples and put the cans in the right locations for the next trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experimental set-up consisted of seven steel cans (18 cm high × 17 cm in diameter), each containing one small canister (5.2 cm in diameter, 2 cm high) in which one odour sample was placed. These canisters prevented the dog from being in direct contact with samples. The cans were in a semicircle arrangement, equidistant (2.08 m) from the Pet Tutor®. Each can contained an odour sample that could be either a seizure, physical exercise or calm activity sample. Compared to the literature on similar experiments, this is a high average for the number of samples presented in line-up methods and the distance between cans (about 50 centimeters) was comparable&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 8&quot; title=&quot;Sonoda, H. et al.

&lt;p&gt;At each test, all seven cans contained an odour from the same person: one seizure sample, two physical exercise samples and four calm sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Test procedure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials took place as follows: each dog had the first 5 trials using the same person’s odour, a 2-hour break, and then one trial with each of the 4 remaining patients (See Fig. &lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-track-action=&quot;figure anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40721-4#Fig2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, each dog had 9 trials in one day. Each test trial lasted a maximum of 5 minutes, with a 2 min break between each trial in order to remove and replace the cans. Odour locations were pseudo-randomly determined prior to the sessions and changed between trials, with the constraint that the same location could not be used more than three times in a row for the same type of odour in order to avoid learning bias and inducing A-not-B errors (Smith &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Behavioural coding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each trial was videotaped (30 fps, Sony Handycam HDR-CX380) and coded using frame-by-frame playback for accuracy of determination of investigatory behaviour. The latency of first response was measured as well as the time spent by the dog in the olfactory investigation of cans (i.e. nose at less than ten centimeters from the cans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; title=&quot;Horowitz, A.

Given the indication behavior (remain standing with the head above the cans), an indication was counted if it lasted more than 3 seconds. The same person (A.C.), blind to the cans’ contents, coded all trials. Another coder, unfamiliar with the goals of the study, verified the reliability of this coding on all trials. Inter-observer agreement was high (&lt;em&gt;κ&lt;/em&gt; = 0.91).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;narrow-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3 strong mb4&quot; data-test=&quot;sub-heading&quot;&gt;Statistical analyses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity and specificity were calculated after pooling the data across all trials for all dogs in accordance with&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 15&quot; title=&quot;Hardin, D.

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric statistical tests were used&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-track-action=&quot;reference anchor&quot; data-track-label=&quot;link&quot; data-test=&quot;citation-ref&quot; aria-label=&quot;Reference 47&quot; title=&quot;Siegel, S.

Performances for individual dogs were statistically assessed with binomial tests. A Friedman test compared the time spent exploring the different sample categories, with all dogs and trials pooled. To assess potential differences between the odours of each patient, all dogs were pooled on the cumulated exploration time for the five different patients (first presentation of the repeated person and the last four persons). The concordance among dogs’ performances according to persons was estimated using a Kendall test by permutation.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Handle is a mobile manipulation robot designed for logistics. Handle autonomously performs mixed SKU pallet building and depalletizing after initialization and localizing against the pallets. The on-board vision system on Handle tracks the marked pallets for navigation and finds individual boxes for grasping and placing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Handle places a boxes onto a pallet, it uses force control to nestle each box up against its neighbors. The boxes used in the video weigh about 5 Kg (11 lbs), but the robot is designed to handle boxes up to (15 Kg) (33 lb). This version of Handle works with pallets that are 1.2 m deep and 1.7 m tall (48 inches deep and 68 inches tall).&lt;/p&gt;
