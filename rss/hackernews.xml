<title>Public Apology to Jeremy Howard</title>
<link>https://numfocus.org/blog/jeremy-howard-apology</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://numfocus.org/blog/jeremy-howard-apology</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We, the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee, issue a public apology to Jeremy Howard for our handling of the JupyterCon 2020 reports. We should have done better. We thank you for sharing your experience and we will use it to improve our policies going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We acknowledge that it was an extremely stressful experience, being summoned to an interview with several members of a committee, after a week had passed, and without knowing the nature of the complaint. We apologize for causing this stress and will work to improve our process to avoid this from happening in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To clarify a crucial miscommunication that we take responsibility for: At the time of the interview, the committee had not determined that there was a violation of the code of conduct, only that there were two complaints filed and being examined. We apologize for not communicating that clearly from the beginning. We have not recommended any enforcement actions. We had asked to postpone the posting of the talk to the JupyterCon shared space until the complaints are resolved. We realize now that we used overly charged language and miscommunicated the stage of the investigation when discussing the complaints, i.e. saying a violation occurred. We should have been clearer saying multiple complaints have been made and the alleged violation investigation had not been resolved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because of the missteps of this committee, we have asked the NumFOCUS Board of Directors, minus those involved, to take over the work of the committee as outlined in the appeals process of our enforcement guide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[edited: 3:58 pm, 10/30]&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Goodbye IFTTT</title>
<link>https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was a power user of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; for many years, so I had mixed feelings recently about &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/zpx2r&quot;&gt;their decision&lt;/a&gt; to change their pricing model. Under IFTTT's new pricing, you can only have 3 “custom” actions created/enabled at any time – which is quite a downgrade from the current unlimited free plan. On the one hand, I'm glad to see IFTTT take necessary steps to ensure it has long-term financial stability, but on the other hand, I don't personally get enough value from their service anymore to justify a recurring cost. (The plan will likely be $4/month&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;, but if you sign up before a deadline, you can lock in a price as low as $2/month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFTTT was an awesome and uniquely easy-to-use service when it first came out, but now there are better options for personal automation for people like me, who like to tinker with this sort of thing. Systems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodered.org&quot;&gt;node-red&lt;/a&gt; and iOS shortcuts can be self hosted or run on device, and they provide more sophisticated logic for workflows than IFTTT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed on IFTTT this long mostly due to inertia, and it's fantastically long list of supported services. If I needed to throw together a quick spreadsheet-recording automation, or cron-like trigger, IFTTT was a great starting place. However, it does have limitations. Until now (though it seems like this might change with their premium offering), IFTTT basically only did what its name implied: “if this, then that”. No “if X then Y else Z”, no “if X and Z then Y”, etc. Often times, you don't need any complicated logic or filtering, but it was frustrating that there wasn't the option for more advanced automation. Ultimately, IFTTT had a great “on-ramp”, but once you were on board with their system, you realize how shallow it is. Excellent breadth, mediocre depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the past couple years IFTTT's UI has leaned heavily into the “applet” metaphor, with these big goofy toggle switches to enable/disable automations. The site also transitioned towards a focus on community- (or, more often corporate-) created automations, at the expense of the experience for creating your own applets. Like seriously, why is 30% of the UI for an applet &lt;em&gt;details page&lt;/em&gt; (!) taken up by the connection status toggle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt_hu1a43e8a517283105e03bcbb0c4894a01_37903_0x300_resize_lanczos_2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the settings page is comically information sparse. It's pretty clear that desktop-usability was not high on IFTTT's design priorities. You have to scroll the page to begin to start to see what the automation is doing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings_hub4acc09d90c5c0c4cbf3054a07fa3040_91989_0x400_resize_lanczos_2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the UI got to the point where it felt like using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Duplo&quot;&gt;Duplos&lt;/a&gt; or something. It didn't have to be this way! There are great low-to-no-code tools that have much more usable interfaces, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to migrate away, since the move to premium was already going to substantially limit what I could do with IFTTT. In going through my catalog of IFTTT “applets”, I identified 3 main patterns of automations that I used IFTTT for: (1) triggering an action to happen at a specific time, (2) triggering an action to happen in response to a location change (i.e. geofencing), or (3) triggering an action to happen in response to an event in a web service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these 3 buckets, iOS shortcuts readily handles the first 2: as of iOS 14, Shortcuts can be triggered in the background at a specific time of day, or in response to entering/leaving a geofence. Shortcuts also has a much more sophisticated integration with iOS than any of IFTTT's apps, so more exciting mobile automation becomes possible – for example, setting my phone to Low Power Mode once the battery drops below a certain threshold. Of course, you are restricted to apps/services that support Shortcuts, and the number of supported services is considerably smaller than IFTTT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node-red handles buckets 1 and 3: it has good support for time-based actions, and can receive webhooks to respond to events from external services. It also has a great plugin ecosystem, so it's support begins to rival IFTTT's impressive selection of supported services. Additionally, node-red has many “escape hatches” that IFTTT does not: you can use it to make raw HTTP requests and write your own plugins/logic in Javascript, allowing for much more complex automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither node-red nor iOS shortcuts are as easy to use as IFTTT for putting together a simple automation, which is a shame. However, between them (and other alternative automation frameworks that I've trialed, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://n8n.io/&quot;&gt;n8n&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huginn/huginn&quot;&gt;huginn&lt;/a&gt;), I've more than covered my personal automation needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, goodbye IFTTT! 👋 I'm not bitter about them charging for their service; I think charging for software is a good thing! It's just that this was the nudge I needed to move my automations to infrastructure that I have more control over, which has other benefits outside the scope of this article. I'm thankful that a service like IFTTT exists; I still think it's a fantastic tool to “on-ramp” less technical folks into automation and no-code tools.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Maine is breaking new ground as the first state to use ranked-choice voting in a presidential race, putting the system under a spotlight in a national election complicated by the pandemic and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voting method will also be used for Republican Sen. Susan Collins’s competitive reelection contest. The outcome of the race between her and Democratic rival Sara Gideon will help decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maine’s...&lt;/p&gt;

<title>From McDonald&amp;#039;s to Google</title>
<link>https://www.protocol.com/kelsey-hightower-google-cloud</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.protocol.com/kelsey-hightower-google-cloud</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Peter Idah had met Kelsey Hightower before. But this time, he brought his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was March 2016, and the Kubernetes jamboree, KubeCon, was coming to Idah's hometown of London for the first time. Hightower, the de facto spokesperson for Kubernetes just as it was emerging as a force in enterprise tech, was speaking at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idah had watched many of Hightower's talks and demonstrations on YouTube, as a veteran engineer trying to learn new skills like Puppet and Kubernetes. Now, he wanted his son Jovanni to meet Hightower, to see that Black people like themselves could be leaders in a field that has become the driving force behind the modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/newsletters&quot;&gt;Get daily insights from the Protocol team in your inbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I told him was, the first time I saw his video, it struck a chord in me that just touched me in a way I didn't expect,&quot; Idah told Protocol. &quot;What was really surprising to me was that I never knew I needed that. Because I was confident; I didn't know I needed to see somebody who looked like me [leading those discussions].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Hightower, principal engineer for Google Cloud, is one of the most prominent and respected faces in cloud computing and open-source software. He has been one of the most popular speakers at enterprise tech events for several years, marrying formidable self-taught technical chops to a storyteller's voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also stands out as one of the few Black men in enterprise infrastructure tech, a group whose members feel is an even whiter domain within the notoriously homogenous tech industry. For reasons that should be clear, his path to a prominent role in this field has been that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;There's no way a Black guy got there by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He didn't get there by accident. There's no way a Black guy got there by accident,&quot; said Bryan Liles, a principal engineer at VMware and a friend of Hightower's who has also dealt with issues of racism as a Black engineer in the tech industry. &quot;We didn't grow up near Stanford,&quot; he added, underscoring the role that the exclusive Silicon Valley university played in launching Google and many a tech career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower, 39, was fairly well-known in and around the Docker and Kubernetes open-source communities as those technologies emerged around the middle of the last decade, but really caught people's attention with &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/36S7N7OZSTI?t=2705&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a talk at a tech conference in May 2017&lt;/a&gt;, in which he broke from the usual pattern of highly technical how-to presentations to tell his life story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His brief encounter a year earlier with Idah, who now works for rising enterprise star HashiCorp, had left quite an impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He's watching YouTube trying to figure out all this new stuff,&quot; Hightower recalled. &quot;And here's this guy that looks exactly like him. And I know what I'm talking about, and other people say he knows what he's talking about. And he told his son that he wanted just to show him that not only are we allowed to attend the event, we can lead them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;'You have something that I don't'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelsey Hightower has always been a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent his early childhood in Long Beach, but his mother decided to move back to family and friends in their hometown of Atlanta following a divorce, right as Hightower was entering high school. Sports had been his obsession up until that point, but he decided he should probably get a job to help out around the house and pay for his own clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began working at McDonald's, earning $4.15 an hour working nearly 40 hours a week, mostly on the weekends. He was quickly promoted to shift manager at the age of 16, where he had the authority to tell other workers when they could clock out on slow nights, and walked the two miles from his house to the restaurant before every shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They had that place working like clockwork,&quot; recalled Ronnie Jordan, a childhood friend. &quot;He figured out how to do stuff way more efficient early.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img type=&quot;lazy-image&quot; data-runner-src=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDYzNDczNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MjM2NzA0OX0.utwqAC1EhymC80UteS4YZxtOvEQmKxQPHqYybbXp6T0/image.jpg?width=980&quot; id=&quot;e3c58&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; data-rm-shortcode-id=&quot;92b133cdaadf4610ae69dc5514f9ca42&quot; data-rm-shortcode-name=&quot;rebelmouse-image&quot; alt=&quot;Kelsey and Klarissa Hightower &quot;/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Caption...&quot;&gt;Kelsey and Klarissa Hightower attend Homecoming their senior year in high school. They would marry in 2006.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Credit...&quot;&gt;Photo: Kelsey Hightower&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower was also an excellent student. After a brief stint at Clayton State University, where he said the technology classes were more or less glorified Microsoft Word tutorials, he realized he needed a bigger challenge. He enrolled in certification classes sponsored by CompTIA to get his A+ certification, which led to a job as a DSL installation technician for Bell South at the age of 19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my 12th-grade year I said, you know what, maybe this technology thing is a thing, right? You're looking at the stories of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, they didn't go to college. You know, the richest man in the world didn't go to college,&quot; Hightower said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was while working for Bell South in the early 2000s that Hightower had an experience that would shape the rest of his life, a story he told in that pivotal 2017 talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was dispatched to a nice neighborhood in Atlanta for a standard DSL installation. When he entered the home, he realized the customer was someone prominent; he was an architect and city planner, with pictures of himself and several U.S. presidents lining the walls of the office where Hightower was installing the internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer shocked Hightower by declaring right away that a Black person had never stepped foot inside his house. &quot;But you're the only person that can give me this technology right now,&quot; he remembered the man saying, &quot;so I'm going to put all that aside, because you have something that I don't.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;And at that point, it kind of clicked for me: This particular skill set was my Superman suit,&quot; Hightower said. &quot;When I'm wearing the collared shirt with the tool bag, people will respect me for my talents and look past the other stuff. I kind of knew at that point that technology was this super empowering, leveling-the-playing-field skill that I could do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A startup and a standup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working as an independent contractor for Bell South for a few years in the early 2000s, Hightower realized that he was pretty good at this job. Customers began asking him for assistance that went beyond the scope of the usual technician's role, like setting up a network for a small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at a certain point it dawned on him that he could probably make more money working for himself. In his early 20s, he started a solo practice as an IT consultant, eventually hiring others to work for him and opening up a store in Jonesboro, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if there's a word to characterize this stage of Hightower's career, it's &quot;hustle.&quot; After running his own business for a few years, he actually briefly took a low-level tech job at Google and later the Georgia-based financial software company Total Systems (now named TSYS and owned by Global Payments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And alongside those roles, for several years he also dabbled with a gig that taught him a lot about being onstage, dealing with pressure and the importance of getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelsey Hightower managed a comedy act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img type=&quot;lazy-image&quot; data-runner-src=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDYzNDc3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNzgwNzQyNH0.UpjGHNzTYtYkARjDtn3zoS5gMYk5LjW4lwAludhdf6Q/image.jpg?width=980&quot; id=&quot;03fe2&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; data-rm-shortcode-id=&quot;6307bea892222296d3a833feb9a322a5&quot; data-rm-shortcode-name=&quot;rebelmouse-image&quot; alt=&quot;Kelsey Hightower on stage&quot;/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Caption...&quot;&gt;Hightower co-chaired four of the first KubeCon events, which grew from a couple hundred engineers in 2015 to over 12,000 at KubeCon 2019.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Credit...&quot;&gt;Photo: CNCF at KubeCon&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronnie Jordan was getting some attention in the local Atlanta open-mic comedy scene when he and Hightower realized he might actually have a future making people laugh. The two began to work closely together on an act, and Hightower — the only person Jordan knew with a reliable car — started driving him around to different gigs around town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hightower realized that not only could Jordan slay the crowds at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uptowncomedy.net/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uptown Comedy Corner&lt;/a&gt; — arguably one of the most influential Black comedy clubs in the South at that time — but that he could also make people howl with laughter at Jillian's, the suburban Dave-and-Buster's-like attraction favored by white people, he knew Jordan had potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He set up a studio where Jordan could practice his act. He filmed that act and posted it on the web, at a time when very few people understood the potential the web would have to launch entertainment careers. And he encouraged Jordan to try out for an &quot;American Idol&quot;-style comedy show produced by the team behind the &quot;Kings of Comedy&quot; series in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan wound up making the finals and performing before 35,000 people at New York's Madison Square Garden. He won among strong competition and got $35,000 — minus Hightower's management fee, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of his performance, Jordan received offers from other acts to open at shows across the country, but he still only knew one guy with a reliable car. Hightower and Jordan drove across the country from gig to gig in a Chevy Suburban, and even during those long trips, Hightower found time to learn more about his budding career in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was always stopping at a Barnes and Noble&quot; to pick up some new certification book for a nascent technology, said Jordan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ronniejordan.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;continues to practice comedy&lt;/a&gt; during a pandemic that has curtailed opportunities for performers of all kinds. &quot;He would read a whole book in one night.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hightower learned more than tech during that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the entertainment business, you get paid based on perception,&quot; he said. &quot;And I think that's what I learned; it's not about the job, it's about what I bring to the job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Searching for 'Geordi La Forge'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Hightower was starting to get noticed in the Atlanta open-source community thanks to a series of talks at Python meetups when he caught the attention of James Turnbull, an engineering manager for infrastructure management pioneer Puppet Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnbull was struck by the way Hightower and his colleagues at Total Systems were using Puppet, Python and some good old-fashioned hacking to transform how Total Systems deployed software changes to its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This was real shadow IT,&quot; said Elson Rodriguez, a colleague of Hightower's at Total Systems and longtime friend. The financial services company still relied on mainframes and required employees to work overnight to deploy changes manually out of a Word document, which didn't sit right with Hightower and Rodriguez. So they worked together after hours to automate the deployment of those changes, and, despite internal obstacles and Rodriguez's (by his own admission, at the time) overly headstrong attitude, eventually saved the company countless hours each time new software rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;His optimism is just crazy,&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;He's lucky, because some people are optimistic and don't have the energy to see it through and process those lessons. He talks some crazy stuff, and tries some crazy stuff, and doesn't get too upset when it doesn't work out, he just draws a lesson from it and moves on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower was invited out to Puppet's headquarters in Portland, Oregon, to give a talk during the company's annual developer event in front of the whole company, including founder and CEO Luke Kanies. Puppet wound up offering Hightower, at the time a systems administrator, a job as a customer-facing software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My guess is we can't name anybody else we hired in that same position,&quot; Kanies told Protocol. &quot;He was great with people, but he was so much greater at talking about things,&quot; or explaining how customers could use Puppet's technology to solve their problems, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img type=&quot;lazy-image&quot; data-runner-src=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDYzNDgwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxODQzMjM1M30.-2JKve-V7lPhfe9dxBXujJ0iCsAyoZeFQkjlbVnwFzA/image.jpg?width=980&quot; id=&quot;eb065&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; data-rm-shortcode-id=&quot;2aab8b16ba3c8465c3c3208dd45d0ede&quot; data-rm-shortcode-name=&quot;rebelmouse-image&quot; alt=&quot;Kelsey Hightower with his fans&quot;/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Caption...&quot;&gt;Hightower collaborated on a popular book with Joe Beda and Brendan Burns, two of the original creators of Kubernetes.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Credit...&quot;&gt;Photo: CNCF at KubeCon&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of working remotely from Atlanta in 2013, Hightower made the cross-country move to Portland, a place about as geographically, culturally and racially removed from Atlanta as you can get in the U.S. It was early in his Portland days when Hightower got a reminder of what it was like to be the only Black man in a very white tech company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time Puppet decided to build a digital hub called The Forge, where employees, customers and open-source contributors could share packages of Puppet code. As part of his transition from system administrator to software developer, Hightower wound up as the leader of the team responsible for this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual teams at Puppet would give themselves funny or clever names; the team working on migrating Puppet to Windows was called &quot;For the Win,&quot; as an example. One senior Puppet executive suggested that the team Hightower led should be named &quot;Geordi La Forge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;He talks some crazy stuff, and tries some crazy stuff, and doesn't get too upset when it doesn't work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're unfamiliar with that name, as Hightower was at the time, know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startrek.com/database_article/la-forge-Geordi&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geordi La Forge&lt;/a&gt; was the only Black member of the crew of the Enterprise in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; a late 1980s television series that was incredibly popular with white Generation X tech workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I actually go to my desktop, and I start searching for his name and it's, like, wait a minute! This is the only Black engineer on 'Star Trek'! Like, how did y'all pick that name for my team?&quot; Hightower remembered, laughing as he did. At the time he took it in stride, even changing his Twitter profile picture to a picture of the character to tweak his new colleagues, making them initially nervous that they had offended him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Hightower and Kanies recalled the story with humor, and it doesn't appear that there was any ill will on the part of the executive who suggested the name. But the term &quot;microagression&quot; was not as widely understood eight or so years ago, Kanies allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you'd gone back to me at that time, I'd say I was much less aware of the struggles in general,&quot; Kanies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rise of the container&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower is grateful for his time at Puppet, which introduced him to a much wider tech audience, got him involved more closely with the open-source community, and started him down the path toward becoming one of the more sought-after speakers on the cloud circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But around 2014, he realized that Puppet's main business at the time — selling configuration management software to companies running their own data centers — was about to be transformed by two breakthroughs in infrastructure technology: the Go programming language and Docker containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at Google, the company had been refining Go as a modern update to the concepts behind C++, one of the most widely used infrastructure languages at that time. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/rust-programming-safety-security&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;, another programming language developed around this time, Go simplified some tasks and made it harder for programmers to make memory-handling mistakes that cause security holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containers have been part of Unix and Linux for a long time, allowing developers to turn applications into portable packages for faster, easier deployment across different types of servers, both in-house and on the cloud. However, in 2013, Docker introduced a user-friendly way to take advantage of container technology, and demand exploded: Docker containers became one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/07/01/how-docker-escaped-near-death-to-become-softwares-next-big-thing/#65c0e9f45747&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fastest-adopted new enterprise technologies&lt;/a&gt; in memory, and, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/docker-containers-cloud-developers-enterprise&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;while the company has struggled&lt;/a&gt;, the technology underpins the modern &quot;cloud native&quot; movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower was fascinated by the concept from the moment he heard about it. &quot;What if we changed the abstractions to be less about Linux and various programming languages to this thing called containers? That really piqued my interest,&quot; Hightower said. &quot;I knew that I wanted to head in that particular direction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img type=&quot;lazy-image&quot; data-runner-src=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDYzNDgwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDA3MDc2OX0.IABwf5biiW_ysODMGEyHjtf7xIc-JN094J6CXyqhWo0/image.jpg?width=980&quot; id=&quot;a9ba9&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; data-rm-shortcode-id=&quot;cfb72bbe28b872ea8657c1262a5d3f00&quot; data-rm-shortcode-name=&quot;rebelmouse-image&quot; alt=&quot;Kelsey Hightower &quot;/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Caption...&quot;&gt;Hightower speaks at KubeCon 2017 in Austin, Texas.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Credit...&quot;&gt;Photo: CNCF at KubeCon&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief stint at a Portland startup called Monsoon Commerce where he wrote his first open-source project, a configuration management tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.confd.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Confd&lt;/a&gt;, he joined another startup called CoreOS in early 2014. CoreOS developed a rival container format to Docker's and wound up becoming a key contributor to Kubernetes, the open-source container-management project born out of Google that would change Hightower's life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn't a founder of CoreOS, but I played a role that became very instrumental to the company's success,&quot; Hightower said. &quot;I think that kind of cemented me as an individual, my ability to make change no matter the environment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hightower stayed at CoreOS for a little over two years (the company was later acquired in 2018 by IBM for $250 million), learning what it took to run an enterprise technology business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that time, Hightower embraced Kubernetes, traveling the world speaking at developer conferences large and small evangelizing this project. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2019/kubernetes-5-joe-beda-brendan-burns-craig-mcluckie-past-future-true-value-open-source/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Outside of co-founders Joe Beda, Brendan Burns and Craig McLuckie&lt;/a&gt;, he quickly became one of the most recognizable faces of the project, which was quickly gaining converts as the best way to manage large clusters of containers at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower wound up collaborating with Beda and Burns on a book called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Running-Dive-Future-Infrastructure/dp/1491935677&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kubernetes Up and Running,&lt;/a&gt;&quot; which was published in 2017 and introduced him to a wider technical audience, setting the stage for Kubernetes to become one of the most influential open-source projects of the container era and a key building block for modern tech infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The whole Kubernetes and cloud-native journey has been full of an amazing amount of drama, it's tested all of us,&quot; said Beda, now a principal engineer at VMware who happened to be standing next to Hightower in London when he encountered Idah. &quot;And through all of this, I've been incredibly impressed with Kelsey rising above it and really consistently being a stand-up person.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taking a human touch to Google&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first Hightower wasn't entirely sure about joining Google, despite entreaties from some prominent members of the Kubernetes community. The project originated at Google, but it grew quickly as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, created in August 2015 by Google and other partners as a subset of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/linux-foundation-open-source-enterprise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, he was in talks with members of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California involving a possible role there, and he hesitated about joining Google because of &quot;the fear of being put in a box. I had never met any company that could afford to let someone be who they were outside of a HR, well-defined job definition,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower actually rejected Google three times, but as he would come to learn, Google, of course, can afford lots of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Google just had such a competitive story, long term,&quot; he said. &quot;I talked to the NASA team, and they said, 'Look, Kelsey, it's going to take us 10 years to get to Mars, probably longer. Go to Google. If it doesn't work, we'll be happy to have you here at NASA.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower officially joined Google in November 2015, and five years later, it's working out pretty well for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which built some of the most impressive distributing computing architecture in the world during its rise to prominence, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2019/interview-google-cloud-ceo-thomas-kurian-open-source-aws-working-military/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;struggled to empathize with the average cloud buyer&lt;/a&gt;, who doesn't need to do things Google's way. Along with serious technical skills, Hightower brought a more human touch to the developer relations role that all cloud vendors employ in an effort to get rank-and-file engineers excited about their services. Now, he spends most of his time talking to customers, figuring out what they really need from their cloud provider, and bringing those insights back to the product development team to improve Google's services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img type=&quot;lazy-image&quot; data-runner-src=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDYzNDgwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNDEzMDQxNH0.DcVJ_DQuleTOoPKtr02nvDoivfMPUUNkBap9noj5jMM/image.jpg?width=980&quot; id=&quot;78699&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; data-rm-shortcode-id=&quot;5f84e8055cea68fcd304969ff8a600a3&quot; data-rm-shortcode-name=&quot;rebelmouse-image&quot; alt=&quot;Kelsey Hightower &quot;/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Caption...&quot;&gt;Hightower is &quot;leading by influence, and that is a difficult skill to develop,&quot; says one of his colleagues.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Credit...&quot;&gt;Photo: CNCF at KubeCon&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Brewer, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and vice president of infrastructure at Google, says that Hightower's approach is &quot;super authentic,&quot; which surely helps. &quot;One thing Kelsey and I share is that we are not leading by authority,&quot; Brewer added. &quot;I have no direct reports, he has no direct reports; we are leading by influence, and that is a difficult skill to develop.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's especially difficult inside a company like Google, which has world-class talent working on some of the industry's most difficult problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In college football, you've got the Heisman winners, but when you go to the NFL, you're a rookie all over again. When you go to Google, just the sheer amount of experience they have with large problems, you have to work hard to be creative,&quot; Hightower said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower has also played a prominent role in the rise of the CNCF. He co-founded the KubeCon conference in 2015 before the CNCF took over the event the following year, and he co-chaired four of the first events, starting with a gathering of just a few hundred infrastructure geeks and growing into a massive event in San Diego last November that attracted 12,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those early KubeCons &quot;very much set the tone for the community,&quot; said Liz Rice, vice president of open-source engineering at Aqua Security and co-chair of several KubeCon events in 2018, including the European event in Copenhagen she co-chaired with Hightower. &quot;I can't really think of a better person to introduce me to what that role was all about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;You need a little bit of everyone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Hightower is something of a legend inside the world of cloud tech, one of the most sought-after speakers and recognizable faces in the industry. But that wasn't always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was the conference held by a company where he'd been asked to deliver a keynote speech, and employees of that company kept asking him where to find the green room and where the drinks were being served. There was another conference where Hightower was scheduled to moderate a panel, and a Fortune 500 executive who was also going to be on the panel didn't recognize Hightower. He asked him for directions to the event, making for a very awkward moment when they met again backstage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;After the second time, I kind of realized, without the name, without the name recognition, the stereotype is still with you. That's how people see me,&quot; Hightower said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry has belatedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/facebook-maxine-williams-diversity-inclusion-interview&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;tried to fix its diversity problems&lt;/a&gt;, but its meager efforts are starting to get pushback both internally and at the highest levels of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hightower currently sits on an internal council at Google focused on inclusion and retention, which has been a problem for the company over the last few years. He was initially reluctant to participate in those types of efforts, given the massive challenges presented by hundreds of years of structural racism and the physical and emotional labor that tends to get dumped on BIPOC employees at tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img type=&quot;lazy-image&quot; data-runner-src=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDYzNDc2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDgxODY0NX0.DWUUKO-2ZBCXY44rO4xcEX8CR2TgJ-IxXZN4pqWmM2M/image.jpg?width=980&quot; id=&quot;ac0fc&quot; class=&quot;rm-shortcode&quot; data-rm-shortcode-id=&quot;b616c9a2d6ea7bdc0d1961ed5504131a&quot; data-rm-shortcode-name=&quot;rebelmouse-image&quot; alt=&quot;Kelsey Hightower and his family&quot;/&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-caption&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Caption...&quot;&gt;Kelsey, Klarissa and Kelis Hightower.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;image-media media-photo-credit&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Photo Credit...&quot;&gt;Photo: Kelsey Hightower&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the need for his participation clicked for him on a flight in 2017, in which he happened to be sitting in first class next to another person returning from briefing an unnamed but high-profile social media executive on the importance of diversity and inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Hightower asked how the person had attempted to accomplish that task, the person pointed out that they were currently flying in one of humanity's greatest achievements, created by the aerospace industry. That industry, his fellow passenger told him, is even less diverse than the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So he said, 'If you look at this plane, it was not created by the very best that humans can do. It was created by a subset of human intelligence. The number of people who even get to work in the aerospace industry is very limited. And it doesn't reflect the absolute boundaries of humanity, it represents a subset of humanity,'&quot; Hightower recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;There's just no way you're going to produce the best of everything without a little bit of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until people start treating this kind of diversity of thoughts, race, color, backgrounds, experience as something that can lead to the absolute best outcome, then that company will be without a doubt selling themselves short,&quot; he said. &quot;There's just no way you're going to produce the best of everything without a little bit of everyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of us, Hightower isn't sure what comes next in what has already been an extraordinary journey. He's had offers to run enterprise tech companies, and he serves on several advisory boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He closed our last interview with the story of a tech worker who learned Kubernetes while watching videos of Hightower in prison. He met Hightower at an event, and in a low voice — his boss didn't know he had been in prison — he told Hightower his story and thanked him for changing his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's how I want to be remembered,&quot; Hightower said. &quot;I want to be remembered as this person who helped other people find out how to be better than they currently are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;: An earlier version of this story misrepresented Ronnie Jordan's standing in the comedy bakeoff. He did not get second place, but in fact won.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Hello HN,
&lt;p&gt;I'm Jakub and I'm the founder of Deepnote (&lt;a href=&quot;https://deepnote.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://deepnote.com/&lt;/a&gt;). We're building a better data science notebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, I spent most of my time working on developer tools, building IDEs, and studying human-computer interaction. I helped build a couple of startups, I built tools for JavaScript development, and worked on Firefox DevTools. But once I started to work with data scientists, all those code editors and IDEs that I knew as a software engineer suddenly stopped being the right tool for the job. Notebooks were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notebooks as we know them today have many pain points (versioning, reproducibility, collaboration). They don't work well with other tools. They don't exactly encourage best practices. But none of these are fundamental flaws of the notebook paradigm. They are signs of a new computational medium. Much like spreadsheets in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, my co-founders and I started to think about a better data science notebook. Deepnote is built on top of the Jupyter ecosystem. We are using the same format, and we intend to remain fully compatible in both directions. But to solve the above problems, we've introduced significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we made collaboration a first-class citizen. To allow for this, Deepnote runs in the cloud by default. Every Deepnote notebook is easily shareable (like Google Docs) and easy to understand even by non-technical users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we completely redesigned the interface to encourage best practices, write clean code, define dependencies, and create reproducible notebooks. We also built a really good autocomplete system, and added a variable explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we made Deepnote easy to integrate with other services. We didn't want to build another data science platform where people work with an iframed notebook. We want to build an amazing notebook that plays well with other services, databases, ML platforms, and the Jupyter ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out a 2-min demo here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loom.com/share/b7e05ecca78047c2a2f687d77be8ecea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.loom.com/share/b7e05ecca78047c2a2f687d77be8ecea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a new computational medium is hard. It takes time. Today, we're launching a public beta of Deepnote. Not everything works yet. Some pieces are missing. But we also have a lot in store, including versioning, code reviews, visualizations. We still have a lot to learn too, so I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Edsger Dijkstra – The Man Who Carried Computer Science on His Shoulders</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;s it turned out&lt;/span&gt;, the train I had taken from Nijmegen to Eindhoven arrived late. To make matters worse, I was then unable to find the right office in the university building. When I eventually arrived for my appointment, I was more than half an hour behind schedule. The professor completely ignored my profuse apologies and proceeded to take a full hour for the meeting. It was the first time I met Edsger Wybe Dijkstra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of our meeting in 1975, Dijkstra was 45 years old. The most prestigious award in computer science, the ACM Turing Award, had been conferred on him three years earlier. Almost twenty years his junior, I knew very little about the field—I had only learned what a flowchart was a couple of weeks earlier. I was a postdoc newly arrived from communist Poland with a background in mathematical logic and a plan to stay in the West. I left the meeting with two book recommendations and a copy of a recent research article Dijkstra had written. He also suggested that I learn the programming language Pascal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra passed away in 2002. During the 1970s and 1980s, at the height of his career, he was probably the most discussed scientist in his field. He was a pioneer and a genius whose work and ideas shaped the emerging field of computer science like few others. It was over the course of his career that computer science became a respectable and established discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an enduring tension between the engineering view of computer science, which is focused on building software systems and hardware components, and the mathematical and logical view, which aims to provide rigorous foundations for areas such as programming. Dijkstra tried to reconcile both views. As a result, he contributed to both sides of the divide in a number of fundamental ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra was also a most striking and unusual person. He was admired and criticized, in equal measure, and commented upon by almost everyone he came into contact with. Yet, despite his achievements, Dijkstra has always remained largely unknown outside computer science. Eighteen years after his death, few people have heard of him, even in his own country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;dsger Dijkstra&lt;/span&gt; was born in Rotterdam in 1930. He described his father, at one time the president of the Dutch Chemical Society, as “an excellent chemist,” and his mother as “a brilliant mathematician who had no job.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1948, Dijkstra achieved remarkable results when he completed secondary school at the famous &lt;em&gt;Erasmiaans Gymnasium&lt;/em&gt; in Rotterdam. His school diploma shows that he earned the highest possible grade in no less than six out of thirteen subjects. He then enrolled at the University of Leiden to study physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1951, Dijkstra’s father suggested he attend a three-week course on programming in Cambridge. It turned out to be an idea with far-reaching consequences. It was in Cambridge that Dijkstra met the mathematician and computer scientist Adriaan van Wijngaarden, who subsequently offered him a job at the Mathematisch Centrum (Mathematical Centre) in Amsterdam, which he joined the following year. Dijkstra became, in his own words, “the first Dutchman with the qualification ‘programmer’ on the payroll.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1956, he finished his studies in Leiden. Three years later, he defended his PhD thesis, “Communication with an Automatic Computer.” His supervisor was van Wijngaarden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra worked at the Mathematisch Centrum until 1962, when he moved to Eindhoven to assume the position of professor in the mathematics department of the Eindhoven University of Technology. In 1973, he reduced his employment to one day a week and for the remaining four days worked as a research fellow at the Burroughs Corporation, at that time an innovative American computer manufacturer. His only duties for Burroughs involved undertaking research and traveling to the US a few times each year to visit the company headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dijkstra’s reports, he listed the address Plataanstraat 5, Nuenen 4565, The Netherlands. This led some to assume that the Burroughs Corporation had opened a new office. The address was, in fact, that of Dijkstra’s home, a modest house situated in a village near the outskirts of Eindhoven. His office consisted of a small room on the second floor, which was equipped with an “elegant portable Olivetti typewriter” and “two telephones … one of which he could use to call anywhere in the world, with the bills going direct to Burroughs.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, disenchanted with a change of direction at the Burroughs Corporation and a lack of support for computer science at his university, Dijkstra left the Netherlands and took up a prestigious chair in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin. “Whereas Burroughs’s intellectual horizon was shrinking,” he later wrote, “my own was widening.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He retired in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2002, Dijkstra learned that he was terminally ill and moved back to Nuenen with his wife, Ria. He passed away in August, just a few months after returning. Ria died ten years later. The couple are survived by three children: Femke, Marcus, and Rutger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of his career, Dijkstra wrote around 40 journal publications and 30 conference publications.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He is listed as the sole author for almost all of these works. Several of his journal papers were just a couple of pages long, while most of his conference publications were nonrefereed manuscripts that he presented during the Annual International Marktoberdorf Summer School and published in the school proceedings. He also wrote a handful of book chapters and a few books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewed from this perspective, Dijkstra’s research output appears respectable, but otherwise unremarkable by current standards. In this case, appearances are indeed deceptive. Judging his body of work in this manner misses the mark completely. Dijkstra was, in fact, a highly prolific writer, albeit in an unusual way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EWDs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;n 1959, Dijkstra&lt;/span&gt; began writing a series of private reports. Consecutively numbered and with his initials as a prefix, they became known as EWDs. He continued writing these reports for more than forty years. The final EWD, number 1,318, is dated April 14, 2002. In total, the EWDs amount to over 7,700 pages. Each report was photocopied by Dijkstra himself and mailed to other computer scientists. The recipients varied depending on the subject. Around 20 copies of each EWD were distributed in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EWDs were initially written in Dutch using a typewriter. In 1972, Dijkstra switched to writing exclusively in English, and in 1979 he began writing them mostly by hand. The EWDs consisted of research papers, proofs of new or existing theorems, comments or opinions on the scientific work of others (usually critical and occasionally titled “A somewhat open letter to…”), position papers, transcripts of speeches, suggestions on how to conduct research (“Do only what only you can do”), opinions on the role of education and universities (“It is not the task of the University to offer what society asks for, but to give what society needs”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), and original solutions to puzzles. Later reports also included occasional accounts of Dijkstra’s life and work. A number of EWDs are titled “Trip Report” and provide detailed descriptions of his travels to conferences (“I managed to visit Moscow without being dragged to the Kremlin”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), summer schools, or vacation destinations. These reports are a rich source of information about Dijkstra’s habits, views, thinking, and (hand)writing. Only a small portion of the EWDs concerned with research ever appeared in scientific journals or books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of reporting research was, in fact, common during the eighteenth century. In the twentieth century it was a disarming anachronism. Nevertheless, it worked. In EWD1000, dated January 11, 1987, Dijkstra recounts being told by readers that they possessed a sixth or seventh generation copy of EWD249.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether written using a fountain pen or typewriter, Dijkstra’s technical reports were composed at a speed of around three words per minute. “The rest of the time,” he remarked, “is taken up by thinking.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For Dijkstra, writing and thinking blended into one activity. When preparing a new EWD, he always sought to produce the final version from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 1999, Hamilton Richards, a former colleague of Dijkstra’s in Austin, created a website to preserve all the available EWDs and their bibliographic entries.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-10&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The E. W.  Dijkstra Archive, as the site is known, also offers an abundance of additional material about Dijkstra, including links to scans of his early technical reports, interviews, videos, obituaries, articles, and a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a worldwide search, a number of EWDs from the period prior to 1968 have never been found. Other missing entries in the numbering scheme were, by Dijkstra’s own admission, “occupied by documents that I failed to complete.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-11&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ijkstra was&lt;/span&gt; a true pioneer in his field. This occasionally caused him problems in everyday life. In his Turing Award lecture he recalled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I]n 1957, I married, and Dutch marriage rites require you to state your profession and I stated that I was a programmer. But the municipal authorities of the town of Amsterdam did not accept it on the grounds that there was no such profession.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-12&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1950s, Dijkstra conceived an elegant shortest path algorithm. There were very few computer science journals at the time and finding somewhere to publish his three-page report proved far from easy. Eventually, three years later, he settled on the newly established &lt;em&gt;Numerische&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mathematik&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-13&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; “A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs” remains one of the most highly cited papers in computer science, while Dijkstra’s algorithm has become indispensable in GPS navigation systems for computing the shortest route between two locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a period of eight months beginning in December 1959, Dijkstra wrote an ALGOL 60 compiler with Jaap Zonneveld.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Theirs was the first compiler for this new and highly innovative programming language. It was a remarkable achievement. In order to write the compiler, several challenges had to be overcome. The most obvious problem the pair faced was that the machine designated to run the software, the Dutch Electrologica X1 computer, had a memory of only 4,096 words. By comparison, the memory of a present-day laptop is larger by a factor of a million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programming language itself was not without its own challenges. ALGOL 60 included a series of novel features, such as recursion, which was supported in a much more complex manner than logicians had ever envisaged.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-15&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One of the ideas suggested by Dijkstra, termed a display, addressed the implementation of recursive procedures and has since become a standard technique in compiler writing.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-16&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALGOL 60 was designed by an international committee. Although Dijkstra attended several meetings during the design process, his name does not appear among the thirteen editors of the final report.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-17&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Apparently, he disagreed with a number of majority opinions and withdrew from the committee. This was perhaps the first public sign of his fiercely held independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his employment at the Eindhoven University of Technology, Dijkstra and his group wrote an operating system for the Electrologica X8, the successor to the X1. The system they created, known as the THE multiprogramming system (THE is an abbreviation of Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven), had an innovative layered functional structure, in which the higher layers depended only on the lower ones.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-18&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during his work on this system that Dijkstra’s interests began shifting to parallel programs, of which THE is an early example. These programs consist of a collection of components, each of which is a traditional program, executed in parallel. Such programs are notoriously difficult to write and analyze because they need to work correctly no matter the execution speeds of their components. Parallel programs also need to synchronize their actions to ensure exclusive access to resources. If several print jobs are dispatched at the same time by the users of a shared computer network, this should not lead to pages from the different print jobs becoming interspersed. Adding to the complexity, the components of parallel programs should not become deadlocked, waiting indefinitely for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, these problems had not yet been properly examined or analyzed, nor had any techniques been developed to verify potential solutions. Dijkstra identified a crucial synchronization problem, which he named the mutual exclusion problem, and published his solution in a single-page paper.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This work was taken from EWD123, an extensive 87-page report titled “Cooperating Sequential Processes.” In the same report, he introduced the first known synchronization primitive, which he termed a semaphore, that led to a much simpler solution to the mutual exclusion problem.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He also identified the deadlock problem, which he named the deadly embrace, and proposed an elegant solution, the banker’s algorithm.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The mutual exclusion problem, along with deadlock detection and prevention, are now mandatory topics in courses on operating systems and parallel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Dijkstra published a two-page letter addressed to the editor of the &lt;em&gt;Communications of the ACM&lt;/em&gt;, in which he critiqued the goto programming statement.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Entitled “Go To Statement Considered Harmful,” the letter was widely criticized and generated considerable debate. In the end, Dijkstra’s views prevailed. Every programmer is now aware that using the goto statement leads to so-called spaghetti code. Java, currently one of the most widely used programming languages, was originally released in 1996 and does not have the goto statement. The phrase “considered harmful” is still used often in computer science and remains inextricably associated with Dijkstra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Dijkstra suffered a long, deep depression that persisted for almost half a year. He later made mention of being hospitalized during this period.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One reason for Dijkstra’s torment was that his department did not consider computer science important and disbanded his group. He also had to decide what to work on next. Dijkstra’s major software projects, the ALGOL 60 compiler and the THE multiprogramming system, had given him a sense that programming was an activity with its own rules. He then attempted to discover those rules and present them in a meaningful way. Above all, he strove to transform programming into a mathematical discipline, an endeavor that kept him busy for several years to come. At the time, these were completely uncharted waters. Nobody else seemed to be devoting their attention to such matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, the appearance of the 87-page EWD249, “Notes on Structured Programming,” marked the end of Dijkstra’s depression.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-24&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-24&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The subject of the EWD was so novel, the writing so engaging, and the new term “structured programming” so convincing that the report became a huge success. But, in Dijkstra’s view, “IBM … stole the term ‘Structured Programming’ and … trivialized the original concept to the abolishment of the goto statement.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-25&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-25&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The claim was unsurprising to those aware of Dijkstra’s long-held and largely negative views toward IBM computers and software. Nowadays it is not uncommon to see similar criticisms of large corporations, but in the 1970s and 1980s few academics were prepared to take a public stand against computer manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1972, Dijkstra received the ACM Turing Award, widely considered the most important prize in computer science. He was recognized for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fundamental contributions to programming as a high, intellectual challenge; for eloquent insistence and practical demonstration that programs should be composed correctly, not just debugged into correctness; for illuminating perception of problems at the foundations of program design.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-26&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-26&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further fundamental contributions were to follow. In 1974, Dijkstra published a two-page article in which he introduced a new concept: self-stabilization.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-27&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-27&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the paper, he posed the problem of how a system of communicating machines might repair itself when a temporary fault arises in one of the machines. He presented new protocols that guaranteed correct functioning of the system would eventually be restored. “Self-stabilization,” he remarked, “…could be of relevance on a scale ranging from &lt;em&gt;a worldwide network&lt;/em&gt; [emphasis added] to common bus control.” This is a striking observation when one considers that the World Wide Web was developed just 15 years later. As it turned out, the paper was completely ignored until 1983, when Leslie Lamport stressed its importance in an invited talk. In time, the ideas outlined by Dijkstra would lead to the emergence of a whole new area in distributed computing with its own annual workshops and conferences. In 2002, the paper won an award that was posthumously renamed the Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that some events cannot be deterministically predicted, usually referred to as indeterminism, has kept philosophers, and later physicists, occupied for centuries. Computer scientists enter the story more recently, studying the idea under the name nondeterminism—not a reference, it should be noted, to any probabilistic interpretation of events. In 1963, John McCarthy introduced nondeterminism in the context of programming languages. A couple of years later, Robert Floyd showed how this concept, now known as angelic nondeterminism, can substantially simplify programming tasks requiring a search.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-28&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When choices arise there is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; computation that delivers the desired result—though it is not certain which one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra’s view of nondeterminism was likely influenced by the inherently nondeterministic behavior of the real-time interrupt handler he developed in his PhD thesis. In a 1975 paper, he introduced a small programming language that he called guarded commands; it encapsulated what is now termed demonic nondeterminism.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-29&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-29&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This was, in fact, the paper he handed me the first time I met him. In contrast to the angelic variant, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; computations have to deliver the desired result. This more demanding view of nondeterminism—referred to as &lt;em&gt;nondeterminacy&lt;/em&gt; by Dijkstra—sometimes yields simpler programs, but for reasons other than angelic nondeterminism. The programmer is free to leave some decisions unspecified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programming notation introduced by Dijkstra occasionally leads to elegant programs. He illustrated this point by reconsidering Euclid’s 2,300-year-old algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers. The algorithm can be stated as follows: as long as the two numbers differ, keep subtracting the smaller number from the bigger one. In Dijkstra’s language this algorithm can be written in a simple manner that is not far removed from its description in English.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-30&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-30&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; His language also introduced the crucial notion of a &lt;em&gt;guard&lt;/em&gt;, which has since become a natural concept in various programming formalisms. Similarly, &lt;em&gt;weakest precondition semantics&lt;/em&gt;, a concept Dijkstra introduced to describe program semantics, marked a late but highly significant entry into the field of program verification. A couple of years later, the language was generalized by Tony Hoare to create a highly influential programming language proposal for distributed computing that he named CSP.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-31&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-31&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra’s landmark book &lt;em&gt;A Discipline of Programming&lt;/em&gt; was published in 1976.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-32&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It introduced a novel approach to programming in which Dijkstra combined weakest precondition semantics with a number of heuristics to develop several computer programs, hand in hand with their correctness proofs. In contrast with EWD249, “Notes on Structured Programming,” he was now arguing about program correctness in a formal way. This development marked a new stage in Dijkstra’s research. He now viewed the development of a correct program as the development of a mathematical proof, something to which he first alluded in 1973 as part of EWD361, “Programming as a Discipline of Mathematical Nature.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This methodology was soon employed by Dijkstra and a group of researchers to systematically derive various, usually small, nontrivial programs. In contrast to some of his other innovations, it never really caught on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eighties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;n the early&lt;/span&gt; 1980s, Dijkstra cowrote two short but influential papers in which he applied his methodology to the systematic development of distributed programs.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He also sought to have this approach to programming taught to first-year students, and, with this goal in mind, put together an elegant introductory textbook with Wim Feijen.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-35&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-35&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra’s realization that programming could be viewed as a mathematical activity led to his interest in analyzing mathematical reasoning. He attempted to come up with guidelines and heuristics that facilitated the discovery of proofs. In a number of cases these principles pointed him toward interesting generalizations of known results that had somehow eluded others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example is the Pythagorean theorem, which is taught in secondary schools. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse, &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;, is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://inference-review.com/assets/img/articles/apt/figure-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;ewd-triangle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1940, Elisha Loomis collected no less than 370 proofs in &lt;em&gt;The Pythagorean Proposition&lt;/em&gt;, starting with the proof that appeared in Euclid’s &lt;em&gt;Elements&lt;/em&gt;, written around 300 BCE.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-36&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; New proofs occasionally appear to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Dijkstra came up with the following generalization to arbitrary triangles, which he included in EWD975:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a triangle with the side lengths &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; and the angles &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;γ&lt;/em&gt;, lying opposite &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;. Then the signs of the expressions &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; – γ are the same (that is, they are either both positive or both zero or both negative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://inference-review.com/assets/img/articles/apt/figure-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;ewd-triangle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;equation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;sign&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = &lt;em&gt;sign&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;α&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;γ&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mathematician might observe that this all seems quite obvious. Yet, apparently, nobody had thought of this generalization before Dijkstra. He concluded his report by observing that it was unclear where he might publish this result. In his view, it should be taught at schools instead of the original theorem. In 2009, EWD975 was republished posthumously by &lt;em&gt;Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde&lt;/em&gt; (New Archive for Mathematics), the magazine of the Royal Dutch Mathematical Association.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-37&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The five-page report was reproduced in its original handwritten form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1985 lecture, “On Anthropomorphism in Science,” delivered at the University of Texas at Austin’s Philosophy Department, Dijkstra speculated that mathematicians stuck to the use of implication because they associated it with cause and effect. “Somehow,” he observed, “in the implication ‘if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;,’ the antecedent &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is associated with the cause and the consequent &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; with the effect.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-38&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-38&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He claimed that equivalence should be preferred over implication. This simple principle had led to his generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra also attempted to apply his methodology for developing correct programs to systematically develop proofs of mathematical theorems. In EWD1016, “A Computing Scientist’s Approach to a Once-Deep Theorem of Sylvester’s,” he derived an elegant proof of the following theorem, first conjectured in 1893 and proved 40 years later: “Consider a finite number of distinct points in the real Euclidean plane; these points are collinear or there exists a straight line through exactly 2 of them.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-39&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example from this period is his approach to the problem of a fair coin. A coin toss is used to determine one of two outcomes in a fair way. But how can a fair outcome be achieved when the coin is biased? In 1951, John von Neumann came up with a simple solution.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-40&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-40&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A number of researchers then tried to figure out how to make it more efficient. Dijkstra first learned of the problem during a lecture in 1989. He solved it immediately and a little while later came up with the solution to a related problem that apparently nobody had thought of before. His solution to the related problem can be found in EWD1071, “Making a Fair Roulette from a Possibly Biased Coin.” Dijkstra’s modification of von Neumann’s solution was not immediately obvious and relies on a classic result from number theory, Fermat’s little theorem. For a change, Dijkstra submitted this article to a journal and it was published the following year as a one-page note.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-41&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-41&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a natural and readable notation for representing proofs and calculations was almost as important for Dijkstra as the problems under consideration. The notation he came up with forces the author not to commit what he described as “any sins of omission”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ewd&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-pad&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;l-pad-lgr&quot;&gt;{ hint why &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-pad&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;l-pad-lgr&quot;&gt;{ hint why &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-pad&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his final EWD,&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-42&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for example, Dijkstra explains that for &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; = (&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;)/2 the equality &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;– &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;)(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) + &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; –&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;)(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;) = &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; holds, by writing out his argument as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ewd&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-pad&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;)(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) + &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;)(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;l-pad-lgr&quot;&gt;{ algebra }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-pad&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;)(2&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= &lt;span class=&quot;l-pad-lgr&quot;&gt;{ definition of &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-pad&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; – &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He used this notation in his own publications, notably in a book he wrote with his longstanding friend and colleague Carel Scholten.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-43&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-43&quot;&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The notation was adopted by several of his colleagues but did not spread further. EWD1300, “The Notational Conventions I Adopted, and Why,” was republished posthumously and offers a unique insight into Dijkstra’s extensive work on notation, a subject that kept him busy throughout his career.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-44&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-44&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s, Dijkstra’s research was described on his departmental homepage as follows: “My area of interest focuses on the streamlining of the mathematical argument so as to increase our powers of reasoning, in particular, by the use of formal techniques.” It was also the subject of his course for computer science students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the period 1987–1990, I was a fellow faculty member in Austin and followed his course for a semester. Dijkstra invariably arrived early for class so that he could write out an unusual quotation on the blackboard. The lectures themselves were always meticulously prepared and usually devoted to presenting proofs of simple mathematical results. He delivered the lectures without notes, requiring only a blackboard and a piece of chalk. At the end of each lecture he would assign an elementary but nontrivial mathematical problem as homework and collect all the solutions at the following lecture. A week later he would return all the solutions with detailed comments, sometimes longer than the actual submissions, and then present his own solution in detail, stressing the presentation and use of notation. My own solutions fared reasonably well by Dijkstra’s standards and were usually returned with only short comments, such as “Many sins of omission.” It was, in fact, a course in orderly mathematical thinking, and nobody seemed at all bothered that it had nothing to do with computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra was a highly engaging lecturer. He knew how to captivate an audience with dramatic pauses, well-conceived remarks, and striking turns of phrase. The bigger the audience, the better he performed. While I was working in Austin I helped organize a departmental event with him as the main speaker. About two hundred people came along, some having flown in from Houston and neighboring states to attend the event. Dijkstra stole the show and delivered a mesmerizing presentation on Sylvester’s theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nineties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;n 1990, Dijkstra’s&lt;/span&gt; sixtieth birthday was celebrated in Austin with a large banquet featuring a distinguished group of guests, including numerous important figures in computer science. A Festschrift was published by Springer-Verlag to mark the occasion. The volume began on page 0, in deference to the way Dijkstra numbered the pages of his EWDs. He took the trouble of thanking each of the 61 contributing authors by a handwritten letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period that followed was marked by a visible change in Dijkstra’s attitude and approach to his work. In the remaining twelve years of his life, despite producing about 250 new EWDs, he published almost nothing. These reports simply may not have met his standards for a journal publication. Many of the EWDs were devoted to systematically deriving proofs of tricky results, such as a problem from the International Mathematical Olympiad. He also used his methodology to obtain elegant solutions for classical puzzles, such as the knight’s tour or the wolf, goat, and cabbage puzzle.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-45&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Some of the EWDs from this period contained accounts and assessments of his early contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Dijkstra’s retirement from teaching in the fall of 1999, a symposium was organized in May 2000 to honor his seventieth birthday. The event was called “In Pursuit of Simplicity” and included guest contributors from both Europe and the US. At this time, I was working at the Centre for Mathematics and Informatics (CWI) in Amsterdam and during the symposium I invited Dijkstra to give a lecture. CWI was, in fact, the new name for the Mathematisch Centrum where he had worked at the beginning of his career. Six months later Dijkstra accepted the invitation. He had never seen the new and larger building where the CWI had relocated in the early 1980s, and was visibly moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the lecture, the CWI’s communication department issued a press release. News of the event caught the attention of a major Dutch newspaper. A journalist was dispatched and an extensive article with a prominent photo of Dijkstra was soon published. VPRO, an independent Dutch public broadcasting company, subsequently became interested in Dijkstra and sent a crew to Austin to make a half-hour-long program about him. “&lt;em&gt;Denken als discipline&lt;/em&gt;” (Thinking as a Discipline) was broadcast in April 2001 as an episode of the science show &lt;em&gt;Noorderlicht&lt;/em&gt; (Northern Lights).&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-46&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-46&quot;&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The episode received a glowing review in another prominent Dutch newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2002, Dijkstra returned to Nuenen, incurably ill with cancer. The news spread quickly in the computer science community and was invariably met with deep sadness. The last time I saw Dijkstra was at his home in July 2002. As was usually the case with visitors, he collected me by car from the nearest train station a couple of kilometers away from his house. During the visit, we spoke together, shared lunch, and he told me that he did not have much time left. He also gave me a copy of EWD1318, “Coxeter’s Rabbit,” dated April 14, 2002, mentioning that it would be his final report.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-47&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra passed away a month later. His funeral was attended by a number of his colleagues, including several from Austin. In his eulogy, Hoare reflected on Dijkstra’s immense contributions to the development of his field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would lay the foundations that would establish computing as a rigorous scientific discipline; and in his research and in his teaching and in his writing, he would pursue perfection to the exclusion of all other concerns. From these commitments he never deviated, and that is how he has made to his chosen subject of study the greatest contribution that any one person could make in any one lifetime.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-48&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-48&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Strother Moore, then chairman of the computer science department in Austin, also spoke warmly and evocatively of Dijkstra: “He was like a man with a light in the darkness. He illuminated virtually every issue he discussed.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-49&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-49&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obituaries subsequently were published in several leading newspapers, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. Extended commemorative pieces and reminiscences appeared during the months that followed, in which Dijkstra was variously acclaimed as a pioneer, prophet, sage, and genius.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-50&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-50&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opinions and Attitudes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ijkstra’s enduring&lt;/span&gt; influence in computer science is not confined solely to his research. He held strong opinions about many aspects of the field, most notably about programming languages and the teaching of programming, but also the purposes of education and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra did not shy away from controversies. He was a dedicated contrarian who reveled in expressing extreme and unconventional opinions. I saw this firsthand in 1977 during a large computer science conference in Toronto. Audiences for plenary lectures at the event numbered somewhere between several hundred and a thousand attendees. Each of the lectures concluded with a few polite audience questions for the speaker, generally a leading expert in his area. I have a vivid recollection of Dijkstra standing up at the end of one lecture and delivering a stinging rebuke to the speaker. Contrary to appearances, he was hoping to provoke an informative discussion. The chairman was visibly taken aback by Dijkstra’s intervention and appeared at a loss as to how he should proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra was also unafraid to voice harsh critiques at smaller gatherings. In the late 1970s, I attended a seminar in Utrecht with about twenty other participants, including Dijkstra. He repeatedly interrupted a highly respected lecturer to query him about his use of terminology and abbreviations. Halfway through the presentation Dijkstra abruptly got up and left. Other stories in a similar vein were far from uncommon and circulated throughout the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra took his work as a reviewer extremely seriously and his reports were detailed and carefully thought out. Some of these reviews were undertaken at his own initiative and appeared as EWDs. These included a positive review of a 400-page computer science book that had no obvious connection to his research.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-51&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-51&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He also produced extensive and thoughtful comments on manuscripts sent to him by his colleagues who had adopted his notation or methodology, or whose research he deemed important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Dijkstra wrote a vitriolic review of a report, “Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs,” by Richard De Millo, Richard Lipton, and Alan Perlis. The report later appeared as a journal paper.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-52&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-52&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dijkstra distributed his review as EWD638, “A Political Pamphlet from the Middle Ages,” in which he referred to the report as “a very ugly paper.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-53&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-53&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The authors had argued that “program verification is bound to fail,” a view Dijkstra vehemently disagreed with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these reviews led to further correspondence with the original authors. In 1978, Dijkstra distributed a detailed and scathing review of the 1977 Turing Award Lecture delivered by John Backus. In EWD692 he argued that the lecture “suffers badly from aggressive overselling.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-54&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-54&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At the time, Backus was one of the most prominent working computer scientists. He was the co-inventor of a standard notation used to describe the syntax of programming languages, known as Backus–Naur form, and had led the team that designed and implemented Fortran, the first high-level programming language. In his lecture, Backus had advocated for an alternative style of programming, known as functional programming. Four years ago, Jiahao Chen discovered an extensive and highly critical correspondence between Backus and Dijkstra that took place following the review.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-55&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-55&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dijkstra wisely kept these exchanges away from the public eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some quarters, Dijkstra was viewed as arrogant and his opinions considered extreme. When cataloguing their correspondence in his papers, Backus added the comment: “This guy’s arrogance takes your breath away.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-56&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-56&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For many, especially those who adopted his notation, Dijkstra became a figure akin to a guru. A small group of his followers even started their own EWD-like reports, all consecutively numbered and written by hand. Dijkstra seemed indifferent to such displays. “But he takes himself so seriously,” a Turing Award winner once confided to me. Indeed, one sometimes had the impression that he carried the weight of computer science on his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, I was invited to be a lecturer at the annual Marktoberdorf School, co-organized by Dijkstra. Although I regarded this as a great honor, I could not help but feel anxious about having him assessing my work. His review appeared in EWD895, “Trip report E. W. Dijkstra, Marktoberdorf, 30 July–12 Aug. 1984.” I was greatly relieved to discover his comments were not only fairly mild, but even reasonably positive in comparison to his other reviews: “Apt’s lectures suffered somewhat from this [i.e., talking ‘exclusively about CSP’] … The examples chosen to illustrate his points were a bit elaborate, but his conscious efforts to be understood were highly appreciated.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-57&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-57&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by this appraisal, I submitted one of the papers I had presented to a peer-reviewed journal. A couple of months later, the anonymous referee reports arrived. One of the reviews was unmistakably the work of Dijkstra. A detailed criticism of what he regarded as a lack of sufficiently formal arguments, combined with a long list of demands and questions, made attempting satisfactory revisions a hopeless task. Even today, I would not know how to meet these demands because the right formalism is still lacking. At the time, it was nonetheless considered a privilege to have a paper refereed by Dijkstra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Dijkstra presented his views on teaching computer programming in a lecture titled “On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science” during an ACM Computer Science Conference. A transcript was later circulated as EWD1036.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-58&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-58&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; After presenting a sweeping historical survey aimed at illustrating traditional resistance toward new ideas in science, Dijkstra argued that computer programming should be taught in a radically different way. His proposal was to teach some of the elements of mathematical logic, select a small but powerful programming language, and then concentrate on the task of constructing provably correct computer programs. In his view, programs should be considered the same way as formulas, while programming should be taught as a branch of mathematics. There was no place for running programs or for testing, both of which were considered standard practice in software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture and report led to an extensive debate that still makes for interesting reading. Dijkstra’s report was published in &lt;em&gt;Communications of the ACM&lt;/em&gt;, along with his polite but unapologetic responses to mostly negative reactions from prominent computer scientists. While he was praised for initiating a much-needed debate, Dijkstra’s recommendations were deemed unrealistic and too controversial.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-59&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-59&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra often expressed his opinions using memorable turns of phrase or maxims that caught the ears of his colleagues and were widely commented upon. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The question of whether machines can think is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A formula is worth a thousand pictures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of his EWDs, Dijkstra collected several jibes about programming languages, such as: “The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-60&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-60&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At the time, COBOL was one of the most widely used programming languages and these comments were not warmly received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Dijkstra’s opinions were unavoidably controversial and highlighted his longstanding prejudices. When I first met him in 1975 he recommended the book &lt;em&gt;Structured Programming&lt;/em&gt;, but suggested that I skip the final chapter by Hoare and Ole-Johan Dahl,&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-61&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-61&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as it dealt with object-oriented programming. Nonetheless, object-oriented programming gradually became a universally preferred way to structure a large program. But not for Dijkstra. He was still arguing against it in 1999, pointing out during a keynote address that, “For those who have wondered: I don’t think object-oriented programming is a structuring paradigm that meets my standards of elegance.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-62&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-62&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By that time, the popular object-oriented programming language C++ was routinely taught to first-year computer science students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Character and Lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;hroughout his&lt;/span&gt; professional career, Dijkstra remained remarkably modest. He never had a secretary; he typed or wrote all his publications himself. Most were entirely his own work and even the few that listed coauthors were clearly written by Dijkstra, or in his style. After 1979, he preferred to write by hand using a Montblanc fountain pen. His writing style became so recognizable among computer scientists in the 1980s that a fellow academic, Luca Cardelli, designed a Dijkstra font for Macintosh computers.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-63&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-63&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Not long after it was released, Dijkstra received a letter typeset in Cardelli’s font and mistakenly assumed it was handwritten. He felt tricked by the letter and was not amused. Some years later, he was able to appreciate the humor when a colleague in Austin, Bob Boyer, adopted the font for presentations during departmental meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems Dijkstra never applied for any grants—though he did receive at least one, to employ a PhD student—nor did he bring any money, in the form of research contracts, to the institutions he worked for. He also never purchased a computer. Eventually, in the late 1980s, he was given one as a gift by a computer company, but never used it for word processing. Dijkstra did not own a TV, a VCR, or even a mobile phone. He preferred to avoid the cinema, citing an oversensitivity to visual input. By contrast, he enjoyed attending classical music concerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking part in conferences and summer schools Dijkstra often felt uncomfortable in large groups. Unaccustomed to small talk, he usually remained awkwardly silent. Away from the work environment, however, he was completely different. From his time in Austin, I and others recall him as friendly, helpful, and eager to drop by with his wife for a short social visit that often led to engaging conversations. He and his wife liked to invite guests over, for whom he occasionally played short pieces of classical music on his Bösendorfer piano. His favorite composer was Mozart. A striking feature of Dijkstra’s living room was a lectern with a large copy of the &lt;em&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;, which he found indispensable in his work. He is, incidentally, mentioned in the same dictionary in connection with the use of the words &lt;em&gt;vector&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt; in computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Austin, Dijkstra stayed away from university politics. He was highly respected by colleagues, not least because of his collegial attitude during departmental meetings. He took his teaching duties very seriously. Exams were always oral and could last a couple of hours. Upon completion of the exam, an informal chat followed during which the student was presented with a signed photo of Dijkstra, and a beer—age permitting.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-64&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-64&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He held his weekly seminars in his office and served coffee to the students in attendance, often surprising them with his unassuming behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Dijkstra was an uncompromising perfectionist, always focused on tapping his creativity, unwilling to lower his standards, and indifferent toward alternative points of view. He also found it difficult to browse articles in his field to form an idea of their contents and seemed uninterested in tracking down and studying the relevant literature. For the most part, he followed the recommendations of his close colleagues and only studied the papers they suggested. As a result, his own papers often had very few, if any, bibliographic entries. The preface of &lt;em&gt;A Discipline of Programming&lt;/em&gt; concludes with a frank admission: “For the absence of a bibliography I offer neither explanation nor apology.” This cavalier approach led to occasional complaints from colleagues who found that their work was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Dijkstra preferred to study classic texts, such as Eric Temple Bell’s &lt;em&gt;Men of Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;, which he referred to occasionally during his courses in Austin, and Linus Pauling’s &lt;em&gt;General Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, a book he praised in highest terms.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-65&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-65&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This attitude served him well during the 1960s and 1970s, but it became increasingly impractical as computer science matured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in 1990, Dijkstra’s &lt;em&gt;Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics&lt;/em&gt;, cowritten with Scholten, was a case in point. The book not only lacked references, but also exhibited a complete disregard for the work of logicians. Egon Börger penned an extensive and devastating review, claiming that the approach outlined by the authors was not in any way novel, nor did it offer any advantages.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-66&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-66&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He also vigorously criticized the book’s rudimentary history of predicate logic, in which the authors drew a line from the work of Gottfried Leibniz to that of George Boole and then to their own contributions, neglecting to mention anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Börger’s review, some colleagues tried to help by publishing papers that provided a useful logical assessment and clarification of Dijkstra and Scholten’s approach based on their so-called calculational proofs. Dijkstra remained unrepentant. “I never felt obliged to placate the logicians,” he remarked some years later in EWD1227. “If however, [logicians] only get infuriated because I don’t play my game according to their rules,” he added, referring specifically to Börger’s review, “I cannot resist the temptation to ignore their fury and to shrug my shoulders in the most polite manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra’s sense of humor was, at turns, wry and terse. I once asked him how many PhD students he had. “Two,” he replied, before adding, “Einstein had none.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-67&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-67&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On another occasion, he wrote to me that “[redacted] strengthened the Department by leaving it.” In Austin, together with his wife, he purchased a Volkswagen bus, dubbed the Touring Machine, which they used to explore national parks.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-68&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-68&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra was also extremely honest. He was always insistent, for example, that the first solution to the mutual exclusion problem was found by his colleague Th. J. Dekker. In EWD1308, he admitted that F. E. J. Kruseman Aretz “still found and repaired a number of errors [in the ALGOL 60 compiler] after I had left the Mathematical Centre in 1962,” and that the phrase “considered harmful” was, in fact, invented by an editor of the &lt;em&gt;Communications of the ACM&lt;/em&gt;, Niklaus Wirth. Dijkstra’s contribution was originally titled “A Case against the GO TO Statement.” In the same EWD, he also admitted completely missing the significance of Floyd and Hoare’s initial contributions to program verification. “I was really slow” he lamented.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-69&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-69&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;&gt;ijkstra left behind&lt;/span&gt; a remarkable array of notions and concepts that have withstood the test of time: the display, the mutual exclusion problem, the semaphore, deadly embrace, the banker’s algorithm, the sleeping barber and the dining philosophers problems, self-stabilization, weakest precondition, guard, and structured programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shortest path algorithm is taught to all students of computer science and operations research and is always referred to as Dijkstra’s algorithm. Several years ago I saw it illustrated, under this name, by means of an interactive gadget with lights and buttons at the Science Centre Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra and Zonneveld’s ALGOL 60 compiler is rightly recognized as a milestone in the history of computer science—albeit more so in Europe than elsewhere. An entire PhD thesis was recently devoted to its reconstruction and a detailed analysis.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-70&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-70&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The layered design of the THE multiprogramming system is discussed in several textbooks on operating systems, and influenced the design of some later operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the concepts invented by Dijkstra, some have been reflected in book titles. An early example is &lt;em&gt;Structured Programming&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1972.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-71&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-71&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are now several books called &lt;em&gt;Structured Programming Using Language&lt;/em&gt; X. In 1986, a book appeared with the title &lt;em&gt;Algorithms for Mutual Exclusion&lt;/em&gt;—others with a similar title eventually followed—and in 2000 a book titled &lt;em&gt;Self-Stabilization&lt;/em&gt; was published.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-72&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-72&quot;&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkstra’s approaches to nondeterminism and parallelism are part of standard courses on these subjects. His proposal for a first synchronization mechanism triggered research that, in turn, resulted in the development of high-level synchronization mechanisms that are indispensable for parallel programming. His classic problems, such as the sleeping barber and dining philosophers, the latter named by Hoare, have become standard benchmarks. When methods were developed to formally verify parallel programs, the first examples tackled were Dijkstra’s programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Dijkstra’s most enduring contribution may well be indirect—in software engineering. The challenge of producing correct software was an ongoing concern throughout his scientific career. In 1962, he wrote a paper, “Some Meditations on Advanced Programming,” in which he raised the issue of program correctness and expressed the hope that this aspect might someday be referred to as the science of programming.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-73&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-73&quot;&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At a major conference in 1968, it was recognized that the availability of increasingly powerful computers led to increasingly complex and unreliable software systems, a problem termed “the software crisis.” Dijkstra, who was in attendance, could not have agreed more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, he produced a number of engaging and influential essays on software development in which he explicitly referred to the software crisis as an urgent problem. He forcefully argued that software systems should be built on sound design principles, and that correctness should be a driving principle behind program construction. In particular, he introduced the often-cited separation-of-concerns design principle, which, he remarked, “even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one’s thoughts, that I know of.”&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-74&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-74&quot;&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Following the example of Hoare and Wirth, he also advocated for various forms of abstraction and the use of assertions to annotate programs. At a later stage, he argued that the programming process itself should be viewed as a mathematical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Dijkstra’s idealized vision that programs should be constructed together with their correctness proofs has not been realized, it undoubtedly provided the impetus for new methods of structuring and developing programs—including, somewhat paradoxically, the emergence of the object-oriented programming paradigm that he so vigorously opposed. This vision also helped motivate the design of new programming languages, along with platforms and systems to facilitate the programming process. Finally, Dijkstra’s “Notes on Structured Programming” was highly influential in the development of better designed and more systematic courses on programming, occasionally with an emphasis on systematic program construction and correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to find another scientist who left such an impressive mark in the history of computer science.&lt;sup id=&quot;footnote-75&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#endnote-75&quot;&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;endnote-15&quot;&gt;Recursion refers to the property that a function or a procedure is defined in terms of itself. It was first introduced in programming languages a couple of months earlier by John McCarthy in the language Lisp. Recursive procedures in ALGOL 60 are much more complex than in Lisp. &lt;a href=&quot;https://inference-review.com/article/the-man-who-carried-computer-science-on-his-shoulders#footnote-15&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;larrhk;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<og:title>The Man Who Carried Computer Science on His Shoulders – Krzysztof Apt – Inference</og:title>
<og:description>Little known outside his field, Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was a highly influential and often controversial figure in the history of computer science. Krzysztof Apt writes a tribute to his colleague, a pioneer and a genius whose work shaped the field like few others.</og:description>

Most of these are programming tutorials related to some obscure Rails features. Honestly, I feel like Medium is the worse place to put your content.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;EDIT: For context, I don’t mind people monetizing their content, but in that case I’d rather pay them directly (like GoRails), and not a “subscription” for something I might check once in a while.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;20.908296943231&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Exactly. I run Better Programming, which is the second biggest programming publication on Medium after Towards Data Science. And it's definitely the case that authors are opting in to the deal that Medium offers: a usually small amount of money and a fairly large boost in readers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The average article we publish does 10k views, which for most authors is way more than they'd get self-hosting and posting out to Twitter/FB.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think also that Medium is still overly dominated by user generated content, i.e. what people here are calling low quality articles. You'd think of that content differently if it were better curated and better edited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But all of Medium's subscriber revenue gets reinvested in their content. Most of that is author payments, but also they pay copy editors and curation editors. What they haven't done in programming yet is pay for any articles that have had a proper high quality edit. In programming that's a story editor, tech reviewers and a bug/errata updating process. But I suspect that will change because the subscription numbers are starting to be big enough that they can afford to invest in these things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;8.9158878504673&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Personally, I use an ad blocker - because I'm worried about the security of third-party code running on my machine. But I'm also moving towards the OP's idea... I stop reading articles/content that require a technical workaround to a political/philosophical problem. Any workaround strengthens the core problem.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Medium doesn't mind if you use a workaround - as long as you are using it. The business model is validated and metrics show that users are happy with it. The only way to change their mind is to stop using it entirely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That's like not plugging a leak in the International Space Station with multiple layers of duct tape because it is a work around, while waiting for a proper replacement panel that will arrive in 3 months...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That analogy is a little flawed. More like there is something in the ISS that is causing leaks and the solution is to duct tape them.&lt;/span&gt;

I don't know the business model of Medium, don't know if contributors are getting paid, but I only suggested a way to read the articles without having to pay, before the issue gets resolved.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I mean, if people can't afford the $5 per month that it costs to read all medium posts, they really shouldn't waste the time complaining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It may be my &quot;reach&quot; as others have stated. I like pushing out the small tutorials that I write, but I just can't justify 3 hours (ish) of work for &amp;lt; $1.50/mo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I also don't want to have to buy a domain and have a hosting service to push my own site having to load it up with ads or other nonsense just to make a side hustle possible. So I stick with Medium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;15.892904953146&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Took a quick look. If you want my take, your basic tutorials are, well... too basic. They describe fundamental language principles in a well-established programming language for which there's already a wealth of material available. Frankly, there's already a million articles and books that cover that.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;IMHO, you need to write about some cool hot or esoteric feature that solves a specific problem in a new way. Or about how a particular crash bug ended being based on something that everyone else thinks works one way when in fact it works the other way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Do a search on a topic. Are there already thousands of pages that cover the same thing? If so, write on something else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Trust me. It's possible to do a lot better than $1.50 an article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;When something is worth it, a la carte works for me. It should cost more than as part of a bundle. (Although I'd need to need your tutorial rather badly to pay the price of a book for it.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Now, if it ripped the authors off or engaged in other shitty tactics, then that's one thing. But nobody is responding with that kind of information. It's all a response against the paywalls, and I'm trying to figure out if it's knee-jerk or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Absolutely good point!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think if I were to rephrase the submitter's comment in a way that aligned with my own views and concerns, it would be:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If your intent is to put information into the world for others to share purely out of charity/a desire to help others, or to get your name out, please consider options other than Medium, as Medium is ultimately in control if whether anyone can actually gain access to the content you've produced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If, however, as you say, one's goal is to produce and &lt;em&gt;monetize&lt;/em&gt; content as part of a personal revenue stream, then Medium seems like as good an option as any (though, personally, I'm not a huge fan of contributing content into walled garden ecosystems where the publisher can unilaterally change the rules on a whim), and folks here complaining that stuff is behind a paywall should go find free content elsewhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I am buying from time to time website-based tutorials or other type of content. I agree this creates a new problem: I don't even know what I bought in the last years, what kind of online live books with exercises I bought and from where. I try to keep them in a document, but sometimes I forget and search email to find out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Still I would like to ask that if someone just wants to share information and it is not focused on monetization then please consider other options than Medium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A lot of newcomers will not make a subscription there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But when they know what your mood is, what your insecurities are, what your financial situation is, past purchases at one retailer linked with your phone number to purchases at another retailer, how likely you are to buy at a certain time of day, etc and then they show you the right ad, in the right place at the right time to exploit all of those things... that is too manipulative for my taste.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For instance, a blog describing some arcane linux command to run to fix the issue you're having does not need to be the same level of quality as something you're reading to learn + get in depth info about a topic you know at a very shallow level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Or something like the old web in general. Or it has to be non profit (no ads, no subscription options, no paid content, only donation/flattr if anything). I haven't decided on a good rule yet, it's quite tricky.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At any rate, the idea is to somehow filter out all the garbage when I just want to know how to do something. Too often I have to find personal blog links on stackoverflow (&quot;PS. I wrote more about it here&quot;) as opposed to that helpful article simply showing up in the search results by itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Because people see writing a blog or guest articles as a sign of possible expertise, but are generally too time crunches to check for themselves.&lt;/span&gt;

Instead I often find it on obscure Blogspot sites with a few posts per year, with archives going back to 2006 or so. That's where you find content from actual good engineers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I have found several articles about Apache Kafka on Medium that have helped me a lot. I have no idea if it's by a junior dev or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;11.883720930233&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There's an interesting tradeoff here, to say the least. Writers want readers. So to some, it's worth sacrificing universal accessibility to gain all of the advantages Medium has to offer.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There just aren't many reasonable, free alternatives for publishing written technical. Medium handles SEO and makes it super simple writers who don't know how to host their own content otherwise to get their ideas in public. Plus, readers who click on a Medium link know they'll see their content in a standardized format.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

This is why I was thinking to write this request here, where there are a lot of technical people who can run their own websites.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Regarding standardized format, yes this is true. I don't have a rebuttal. I think it depends on the job to be done by the reader. For me getting to the information is more important than the format.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I learn things even by reading text mailing-lists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;13.883138564274&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with Medium as a platform for the space between amateur and professional writing, but I don't think it's right for most techie blogs.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For people simply looking to spread ideas and neat little hacks, it's almost always going to be better using either a 'traditional' blogging platform or homebrewing a blog with one of the static site generators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There also seems to be some sort of 'style' that every Medium writer starts to take on that you don't see other places, I can't put my finger on it but there's a certain tone to many of the articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Right and how do you get people to read your blog? Ads? Billboards? No one will find a new blog with no Google juice. I used to get 300K a year but it took more than a decade to get to that level. I gave up on it (job burned me out). Now I get 100 readers a month. If I start up again, it will take years to get a decent readership (never did ads). At least with Medium someone would see it.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;16.882920110193&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It entirely depends on what the goal of your blog is. Do you want to make money? Do you want to just post random thoughts online? Do you want to share solutions to interesting problems you've come across?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I post maybe once a month tops, and for very specific niche queries I'm on the first page of results for the three main search engines. The goal for me isn't to make money or get famous, just to fill in some gaps where nobody's tried something before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm not a medium expert at all, but I would wager that most incoming traffic is going to be from google searches either way. The sad reality is that search &amp;amp; social is the only place traffic really comes from, practically nobody uses RSS or subscriptions anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;19.859943977591&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Here is a questions: What happens if Medium decides to cut your blog from there?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I am not saying they are doing, but what happens with all this knowledge when Medium decides to pivot (I am not saying they do) or to close (hope this will not happen).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I see better chances for the content to outlive when it is spread in separated smaller blogs. Not all of them will close, maybe some of them will be archived, maybe moved to other domains, maybe cached somewhere. But having a lot of content under paywall, without any license on the code shared (or at least I don't know about it) is not creating a comfortable feeling for myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Of course if the purpose is to monetize then maybe Medium is the right place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1. It is public (you don't need a subscription) 2. It has a license for using the code there (&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Though, I'll also say that my experience and expectation from medium articles and SO are different too. Medium lends itself to more end-to-end stories (here are the steps, combining these 3 libraries, to accomplish this task), whereas SO feels like it's more focused (Why does this part of my toolchain break?). The upvote/downvote mechanism also doesn't really lend itself to tutorials. I feel like if you wanted tutorials on SO, you'd want to branch SO itself into a different entity.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And I've yet to see Medium &quot;fill the screen&quot; with annoying banners. In fact, from what I've just seen, Medium just displayed a web page with the article's bottom half telling you you've read all of your free articles and asking you to sign up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You must have a very different experience to me. I'd say the value is about 70-30% in favour of unofficial tutorials for the tech topics I've learned over the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Even StackOverflow is reaching the point of net-negative value; far too many of its questions and answers are outdated, but the nature of their system means the older (first acceptable) answers tend to be promoted as current answers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'd dispute &quot;increasingly&quot; - twas ever thus to some degree.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Spotting whether a tutorial is still valid is a skill that can be honed and it's part of learning how to learn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Your argument has some merit but your solution of &quot;let's stop writing tutorials&quot; seems a trifle extreme. Wishing something was better isn't a great argument for it's extinction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are often useful comments or additional answers on those old questions, but it's a slower process to wade through the old content in hopes of finding a useful new nugget.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;With general Google/DDG searches I often do filter to past year, but I've noticed increasingly that some sites have been republishing old articles with new dates, or minor updates (apparently to bump them up in search results?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Things move so quickly, in tech, that something is out of date, almost as soon as it's published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I've been training for years, and setting up a syllabus/course is a big job. Often, my subject matter may be &quot;old hat,&quot; by the time I am ready to give the course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That often means that I don't teach &quot;bleeding edge&quot; stuff. When I take those courses, they tend to be mighty &quot;scruffy,&quot; with ill-prepared instructors, and lots of &quot;Well, it worked this morning...&quot; stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The same goes for topical material in walkthroughs and tutorials. If they are relevant, they are likely to be &quot;scrappy.&quot; If they are good, there's a fairly high degree of confidence that they will be out of date by the time I see them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Nonetheless, I have gotten fairly adept at translating &quot;dated&quot; stuff to my current circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;9.9161073825503&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Official docs are great, but there is also a place for tutorials. They generally cover different styles of learning.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For example the official docs should probably contain a bunch of &quot;hello world&quot; tutorials for using the features they offer. But often times once you are combining a couple of different tools it isn't clear if it should go into the official documentation for any one of them. ..and I especially don't want the maintainers of the official documentation acting as gatekeepers for what combinations of tools are &quot;useful&quot; enough to be allowed into the one source of information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sort of, If I can write it down in such a way that I can explain it, then I'm more confident I actually understand it. I then look at it and think what would someone who doesn't know any of this ask if they read this or if I was explaining it to them. Sometimes I don't know the answer, so I have to go off and research to allow me to fill in those knowledge gaps.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I find this really helps me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I just don't publish the bloody thing to the internet! Because I know it would just be clutter when people are looking for an actual experts explanation of the thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It also means I have quite comprehensive notes I can go back to, again private though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm not familiar with the workings of Medium, aside from the fact that there's a limit on the number of articles one can read for free each month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; You’ll be able to get paid for all of your writing, some of it, or keep everything free and accessible to all. The choice is yours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So it looks like the authors are the ones responsible for putting up the paywall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The thing with medium is I can write a tech post, and I may not get good reach, but I can syndicate it to another medium blog like the startup, and then it gets mega reach and I make like $100 easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I guess I could just repost my content on my personal blog and charge people like $10/month to access all my posts. Seems $5 though for a multi-publisher paywall is a lot more reasonable than say the wallstreet journal, or new york times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Running a personal website is a time sink and it can become a real pain as time goes on. It’s not a problem to create a personal website and shove a few HTML files on there, or set up a Wordpress installation, or create something with Jekyll. That’s easy enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The problem is that 10 years later, your HTML files are sprawling, or you rely on Wordpress plugins that are no longer maintained, or you’re fighting against your generator for whatever reason.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I’ve somehow managed to get my personal website into a state where posting a new article is little more than adding a file to a Git repo and then running a command to deploy it, but I always feel like I need to modify the scripts, and I always want to revisit choices I made when building the website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;15.93665874901&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;My website is getting a bit big to shove the entire thing into a Git repo, unfortunately. At the very least I would want to have sparse checkouts.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I’ve thought about Hugo but it might require a serious migration effort. My current website is written in Go templates so I can do something like:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    {{.SrcFile &quot;_src.c&quot;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And it will read _src.c and set it up to be highlighted using C syntax rules. Leading underscore just means that the file doesn’t get deployed. This is just one example, there are a number of different things I’ve added to my website like this over the years.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Things would be different if I had chosen a static website generator from the start rather than letting things evolve naturally from hand-written HTML files. Currently, what I want to do is get rid of the templating and use DOM manipulation, so I’d write the above like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;src-file src=&quot;_src.c&quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Just because it would make editing the files more convenient. Putting something like C source code directly in an HTML file is too much of a bother, and I put a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of source code in my website, so anything I can do to save time here means I can write more articles. Markdown makes it easier to embed source code but it’s just not good enough to replace HTML for my use case.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I agree that running a personal website is a time sink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;But there are many other options like: Github/Gitlab Pages, Medium ....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Persoanlly, I prefer simple HTML pages or Markdown. Plain HTML will render easy many years from now. They are easy to transfer and hard to get lost between migrations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;19.904761904762&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;GitHub pages is really just a hosting service for Jekyll. My website is getting close to the maximum size for GitHub pages anyway (the limit is only 1 GB). Medium is unworkable for too many reasons.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I started out writing my webpage in HTML, and if you dig around you can find my old GeoCities page, but plain HTML suffers from some problems that make it high-friction for posting frequent updates. So you start adding a simple templating system. Maybe at first it’s just a header and footer you stick on to every page. Then you start adding indexes so you don’t have to update index.html every time you write a blog post. Your plain HTML starts getting more and more complicated, and it starts relying on some kind of library of scripts which you are now maintaining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That’s what happens if you dive straight into it and use whatever technology is simplest to understand. I think most people would be better off picking a static website generator, to be honest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;(Also: When I started posting content to my website, Jekyll didn’t exist.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My nuanced thoughts are pretty split though. I, personally, would never write on Medium. It doesn't fit the hacker ethos. I would roll my own blog and, try to make the content as accessible as possible.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Despite this I still see the value in Medium over what I would do and over other options like blogger, quora, stackoverflow, etc. Medium's premium content ranges from horrible clickbait to significant thought pieces. It's all over the place but it's best content is pretty good and I think the reason why is because of their monetization strat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;32.878787878788&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Medium's popularity a few years ago prompted an idea for me. I wanted to be able to remove all links to domains I knew I never wanted to visit from all pages because I kept wasting time accidentally clicking them, not realizing where they were going.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I had hoped to pull it off with uBlock Origin but I couldn't get the filters to do what I wanted. I ended up making a Firefox add-on that takes a regex and some css, searches all attribute values and/or text for a match, and applies the css to the element with the match.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So, I have a regex for a handful of popular domains I never want to see and matched elements get &quot;visibility: hidden&quot;. The result is that I never see a link to Medium. In fact, I usually forget the site exists until someone mentions it without linking to it, which is almost always a post about how Medium sucks :) Same for all the other domains in the list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The plugin works on Firefox for Android, so I've enjoyed the benefits there as well. However, I expect that to be a problem soon. I don't do much browsing on my phone anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's only designed for personal use, so the interface is terrible, but I had to submit it to the official add-on repository because there's no reasonable way to run an add-on locally for practical every-day use, so it is available for anyone to use [1].

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I will often (but not always) mirror the article on Medium[1].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'll often post links, here, to the Medium articles, because I have had my site get the &quot;hug of death&quot; a few times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In the old days, that was cool (The term &quot;slashdotted&quot; came from that). These days, it doesn't really mean much; except that the server goes down. I don't get any real advantage from it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think Medium kind of butchers my work. I have full control of presentation, and whatnot, on my site, and I can do series. There are always links to my original articles, because I don't really trust Medium. I could see them try to claim ownership of my work; simply because it's on their server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As for people applying value judgements on me for using Medium? Eh. Whatever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;15.886524822695&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I subscribed to Medium briefly during the lockdown and the content was truly, utterly, awful. Terrible writing drowned out the good and great, reams of tripe, inane nonsense everywhere, and advertised like crazy to me. After a few weeks of this, I cancelled and subscribed to some actual magazines with some actual experts.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So quite apart from the nagging annoyance of being unable to access various padded-out articles (tip: private browsing FTW), this has highlighted that a need from 20 years ago hasn't changed: the world still needs better editors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If the bigger newspapers like NTY, WAPO, The Cardigan would get behind tech in this way AND provide editing and curation, it'd be amazing. Maybe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;25.214532871972&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you're a techie, you are likely capable enough to learn and use a static-site gen and host your blog on Github Pages, Vercel, Surge, Netlify, etc. If you're a techie, you probably also care &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; to not inundate your readers with a crapton of intrusive trackers and weird browser hacks/overrides that Medium employs.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you don't want to use an SSG, or if you're not a techie, you can use or self-host: &lt;a href=&quot;https://write.as/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://write.as/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bearblog.dev/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://bearblog.dev/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rwtxt.com/public&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://rwtxt.com/public&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-federation.info/plume&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://the-federation.info/plume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The downside of the above options is that they are nowhere near as prominent and thus don't provide the same level of discoverability as Medium -- in which case, if you're really hurting for cash and are trying to make a career of writing, maybe it is in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; best interest to stick to platforms like Medium, despite how intrusive and reader-unfriendly they are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;EDIT: I am hesitant to recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://dev.to/&lt;/a&gt; because I have this sinking feeling that it will eventually become like Medium. Also, semi-related, but Dev.to uses endless scroll, which I think is very bad for readers (also it makes it impossible to click links in the footer).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;13.848484848485&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;What I always wondered about is why the (good) people that publish free content on Medium actually publish on Medium.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I mean, talking of technical article/tutorials, it is not like nowadays (and in the last - say - 10 years) there are not other ways (personal site/blog or if the issue is expected huge traffic other free hosting sites, like - still say - github).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;What is the perceived &quot;added value&quot; by Medium (in case of free content)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Better visibility?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;10.915384615385&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As someone who used to run a WordPress blog as a kid and taking a long hiatus from blogging, I'm really happy about all the options there are today. I spun up a blog using 11ty and netlify, and it was just as easy as all the blog posts about them say it would be. I don't think there's a better time to try to self-host a blog if you are at all inclined. I've also been excited about Dev.to (although I haven't dug too deep into it).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;* Shameless plug: my blog lives at salem.io, and I'm more than happy to answer blog-related questions (or any other, honestly) if you're interested in starting but need a little push. My email is in my profile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I guess people in use medium for visibility? What does Medium offer? SEO?

Even worse, there seems to be a massive increase in &quot;articles&quot; coming from a particular part of the world that has churned out masses of sort-of-developers.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'm even starting to wonder if part of their pedagogical process includes &quot;Every week you write an article&quot;. Perhaps by sheer number of posts, an individual has been trained to believe they will be more likely to get hired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So given that most content on the internet is garbage, I will never, ever pay for access to content before I can assess the value of it. I will (and do) subscribe to some writers/musicians on Patreon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Medium might as well be the next Experts-Exchange... cluttering up search results with paywalled trash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Like it or not, websites cost money to run. The more popular they are, the more money it takes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So... what? Spend your own money? Ads? Paywalls? Sell t-shirts? Try Patreon and hope enough people throw a dollar or two into your hat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I'd say 95% of my process with medium goes like this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;1) Finds a blog with a tutorial or something relevant. 2) Opens it and sees a paywall 3) Opens it in incognito mode 4) Browses through the article 5) Leaves the page and learned nothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;13.896755162242&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This! It is market dynamics. If the content isn't worth it to you, don't click the link (or don't read it). If everyone agreed there would be few readers and people would stop posting there.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Personally I avoid Medium links, I find that it &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; worth it to me. But I guess for most people it is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The main counter argument I see is that people aren't aware that viewing their content is painful for many. If that is the case then awareness is good. If authors are intentionally using the paywall so that they can get paid I think that is good! However if they think it is just an easy place to share information then I think it is good that we are asking them to reconsider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Quote: &lt;em&gt;If you are a writer enrolled in the Partner Program, when you click Publish on a story, you will be prompted to choose whether to make your post eligible to earn money as part of Medium’s metered paywall.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only writers in the Partner Program see this checkbox. Stories from writers who are not enrolled in the Partner Program will no longer be part of the metered paywall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So authors obviously have the choice whether their tutorial is behind the metered paywall or not.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not every story on Medium is free, like this one. Become a member to get unlimited access and support the voices you want to hear more from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;6.8754448398577&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I agree on contributing back to a community and there's many ways to do that. That's not every producer's motivation though. Some do this to get paid and it makes sense to publish behind a paywall to do so.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Follow up question. What are opinions on publishing technical books?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;31.861471861472&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This is a great followup question.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don't have an opinion on technical books. I buy them. I have ebooks from Amazon to iBooks, to Manning, Apress, Pragprog ....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I don't have something against paying. I have something against subscription paywall. I pay this month and I read something. Then next month if I want to read my subscription needs to be valid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A book once bought I can read it anytime I want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Also my main thing is not even with paywall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It is a trend I saw which I think it makes the path of self-through beginner harder. Also Medium started to appear from time to time higher than other resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I am working with some people who are trying to switch to IT and I usually need to explain to them either how to open Medium to read the article or how to go to next resources. I am pretty sure some of them are spending time navigating information. Yes, maybe the solution is to say: go and make a subscription to Medium, but it just raises the bar of entering the IT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Then my second thing is this: what happens with all that content when Medium decides to go away (pivot, close ...)? It will vanish like many other great content online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;24942609&quot; readability=&quot;4.4556451612903&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It's like when searching images on Google, you'll find a significant part of them behind Pinterest. I keep hitting Medium when I search and cannot access whatever it is because it's behind their paywall... frustrating.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You can publish on medium and chose not to be behind the paywall. The thing is that most individuals that publish on there want to get paid for it, hence paywall.&lt;/span&gt;

They've become more and more draconian, bloated, and, well, the same as any other venture capitalist ultra-growth-oriented company. The chickens will come home to roost, and if your content and your audience is on Medium, moving them elsewhere is going to become increasingly difficult over time. Ability to export your content always trends downwards as the desirability of doing so trends upwards - a business which is struggling is not going to make it easy for customers to leave.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Always write on a domain you own. You don't necessarily have to own the server, but if you own the domain, you have the freedom of choice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I want a Medium that charges me to write, but anyone can read for free. I pay DO $5 a month to host something, why should I not be willing to gain a benefit of a medium with large SEO and strength in numbers, and pay that $5 a month, but still allow people to read for nothing? But no one wants to pay to read or write so you go alone and google ignores you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Want to see the dirty innards of more Valve code? Well you're in luck as they now have a lot of work involved in the Steam Runtime on GitLab including the Pressure Vessel container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve has for some time now had their own GitHub account, which is where they listed many different open source projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GameNetworkingSockets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Proton&lt;/a&gt; and more. However, they've now added a bunch of other projects to their own hosted GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;steamrt&lt;/a&gt; group on their GitLab, which contains projects for various parts of the Steam Linux Runtime, including the source for the much newer &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/tree/master/pressure-vessel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pressure Vessel&lt;/a&gt; container system which according to Valve contractor Timothee Besset on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TTimo/status/1321891264464379910&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; was previously &quot;only available as a tarball release&quot; from their download servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Pressure Vessel? It's kinda of like a simple version of Flatpak made for Steam games. Within the Linux Steam client, you can select &quot;Steam Linux Runtime&quot; under the right click -&amp;gt; properties menu of games at the bottom like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-fancybox=&quot;images&quot; href=&quot;https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12677870181604053971gol1.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12677870181604053971gol1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then puts those Linux game builds into a game-specific container. There's many reasons for it, like allowing developers to test against a contained environment, and have it run across any Linux distribution and allow old games to continue working long into the future. Learn more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/02/collaboras-fosdem-videos-are-up-including-one-on-putting-linux-games-in-containers-on-steam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where Collabora engineer Simon McVittie gave a run-down of their work. Valve are also now using the latest generation of the Linux Steam Runtime for the Proton 5.13-1 compatibility layer too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we queried on why Valve are now putting more up in the open on GitLab, instead of the GitHub that was being used originally, Besset &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TTimo/status/1321894293502599168&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; to us &quot;The projects you see on GitHub are often mirrored from an internal repo. It's awkward and creates friction for community contributions. The projects on gitlab is where we will do our work in the open.&quot;, which is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Ken Williams wants you to know Sierra On-Line was murdered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kensbook.com&quot;&gt;new, self-published autobiography&lt;/a&gt;, Williams also says he doesn’t want you to remember the company the way you do. Williams founded Sierra as a telecommunications consultancy in 1979, when he was twenty-five; the company was the body to which his wife Roberta gave breath. Her &lt;em&gt;Mystery House&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt;, interactive stories of murder and fairy-tale chivalry, set a course for Sierra through the rest of the twentieth century as the leading developer of adventure games. &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt; begat &lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt;; an adults-only joke book by and for boomer dads; &lt;em&gt;Space Quest&lt;/em&gt;, a goofy, comic saunter through pop sci-fi, and for those who could not sanction such buffoonery, the fastidious cop procedural &lt;em&gt;Police Quest&lt;/em&gt;. The psychosexual horror of &lt;em&gt;Gabriel Knight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Phantasmagoria&lt;/em&gt;; the pun-laden cultural exchange of &lt;em&gt;Quest for Glory&lt;/em&gt;: novelists have made careers writing about families with less personality than the Sierra product line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;55&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams wasn’t a game designer, but a visionary who saw the company always moving forward, leading the market with other genres, other software, online worlds connecting every kind of person. That Sierra is instead remembered, basically entirely, for these 2D adventure games from the eighties and nineties is, he says, because the company was killed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams has compared the end of Sierra to watching his child be tortured to death, but does not, in his book, offer a culprit, and has no real animosity for the most obvious candidate. Why is that? I spoke to Williams, and many others, to understand: if Sierra On-Line was murdered, why does Ken Williams seem to like the man who did it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They stand behind a salmon colored couch. A woman in a dark jacket leans against the back of the couch, where a woman and a man recline against the opposite arms. Together, they are the CUC corporate officers.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Strength of the Chain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta Williams remembers it was Paris. In the lobby of &lt;em&gt;Le Bristol,&lt;/em&gt; before dinner with Sierra’s board of directors. It was the early 1990s. Sierra had gone public, and was fueling growth and share prices with aggressive acquisitions and early adoption of technologies like sound cards and compact discs that translated into lavish on-screen production value. Roberta’s vision as much as her husband’s had brought Sierra to this point; she was established not just as a creative leader in game design but a powerbroker in a public tech company making about a hundred million a year, with an international salesforce and a board that took meetings at luxury hotels abroad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Maybe that was why Walter Forbes came through the hotel lobby in jogging clothes and asked Roberta, can I talk to you alone?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;72&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes, who sat on Sierra’s board, was a greying, bushy-browed Harvard MBA and venture capitalist whose current gig was a company selling consumers complicated access to negotiated discounts at a variety of hospitality and shopping brands. The business was called Comp-U-Card, or CUC. (Time obviously has been unkind to the acronym.) Forbes had bought a seat on CUC’s board with a capital investment, then used the position to oust the founder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes led Roberta to a quiet area of the lobby. He had two things to say. One, that he was on his way up to take a shower before dinner. Second, a question. “Have you and Ken ever thought about selling Sierra?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Sierra was a high-profile public company, so it wasn’t as though Roberta never expected the question. Just not out of the blue, from a CEO in jogging gear whose business model even Ken didn’t fully understand. And why was Forbes asking her, she wondered, without Ken there?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“No,” she said, “we’re not interested.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“But if you ever were,” he said, “what sort of price would you be looking at?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Or had he pulled her aside &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; Ken wasn’t there? Because Ken was the CEO and Roberta the wife, the dreamer of castles and dragons at the kitchen table, whom Steven Levy described in his book &lt;em&gt;Hackers&lt;/em&gt; as “a demure, passive girl” so shy she “could hardly make a phone call”? Even while it was happening, Roberta suspected Forbes was looking for the weak link. Who’d blurt out something important, something she shouldn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta was not the weak link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“A lot,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Both are wearing cozy sweaters. Roberta has long strawberry hair and a reserved smile. Looking down at her as they chat with their arms around each other is Ken, with similar strawberry hair, a thick beard and mustache, and a heavy frame.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Businessmen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I often ask myself if I could have known that Walter Forbes was a crook,” writes Ken Williams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams is a forthright, burly programmer who’s had the same Tom Selleck mustache for forty years and used to be chastised by the readers of his company magazine for never smiling in photographs. As a child, his family fled rural Kentucky and the legacy of a grandfather suspected of bootlegging and murder, for the opportunity of California; Joan Didion’s dreamers of the golden dream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams’ dreams were uncomplicated. He wanted to be rich. “I wanted to live a different life than the one I grew up in,” he writes. “I read books about business executives who owned yachts and jets, and who hung out with beautiful models in fancy mansions.” Roberta was a beautiful California girl who lived “in the fancy side of town, in a pool”; on a double date, Ken downed a beer to show her he could piss farther than his friend. The simplistic plots of Roberta’s early &lt;em&gt;King’s Quests&lt;/em&gt; more or less mapped to Williams’ ambitions. Get the power. Get the girl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;He had programming acumen and unabashed salesmanship. “I was a selling machine. I loved selling and I especially loved making money. I claimed every sales award and couldn’t stop selling,” he writes about his college paper route.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In Sierra lore, he’s famous for hacking the late-‘70s Apple II to render black-and-white line art for Roberta’s &lt;em&gt;Mystery House&lt;/em&gt;. The work was not perfect, it had glitches—which Williams exploited to make the computer produce color graphics. He loved pushing the boundaries of technology, not just for its own sake but for the competitive advantage it could give his company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;By 1990, Sierra had established the Sierra Network, a proprietary social network with multiplayer games; they envisioned, essentially, the breadth of &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; with the mainstream appeal and brand integration of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; but running on modems and servers housed in a local Wild West-themed restaurant. In Williams’ mind, the competition was never adventure game developers like LucasArts and Broderbund, but Microsoft and Disney.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;60&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;By his late thirties, the backwoods of Kentucky were in the rear view. Williams had everything he’d ever wanted. On February 2, 1996, Walter Forbes surprised him with an offer for just a little bit more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes was recommended to Williams by another board member, a fellow venture capitalist. Williams was approached by his first venture capitalist in 1982, when few people, himself included, quite understood what one was. “[But] she was a good salesman,” he writes, “and I was always open to new ideas.” A million dollars in exchange for 20% of the company seemed too good to be true, but Williams figured that such investment was necessary to Sierra's evolution into a grown-up business. Once he’d put one venture capitalist on the board, they multiplied like moneyed rabbits, culminating in the arrival of Forbes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;As a board member, Forbes advocated to grow Sierra by acquiring other software companies. It had paid off. In the financial year about to end, Sierra would declare an increase in revenues to $158 million with a net income of $17.8 million, up from a $7.9 million loss two years prior. But that was nothing to CUC, which in its last financial year had pulled in $1.4 billion in revenue. From coupons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;70&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes drew Williams aside after a board meeting in Bellevue, Washington, and said CUC wanted in on software. Would Sierra consent to be acquired for, say, a billion dollars?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta had never warmed to Forbes, but he was Ken’s kind of guy: a flashy, charismatic and well-connected salesman who flew private jets, socialized with the likes of Bill Gates, made sweeping predictions about the online future, and even already had an internet retailer, NetMarket, in his pocket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes wanted CUC to enter and dominate the software market in one stroke, by acquiring not just Sierra, but LucasArts, Broderbund, the educational software maker Davidson and its subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment. &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Monkey Island, Myst, Prince of Persia, Carmen Sandiego, Math Blaster&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WarCraft&lt;/em&gt; on the same balance sheet. (And, by November, Williams would have the rights to &lt;em&gt;Half-Life.&lt;/em&gt;) “He had come to Ken with the idea that this is kind of a done deal,” Roberta says, “and if you don’t do it, you’re really stupid, because this is going to be &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;. Your stockholders and your board would not like it; it’s almost like you have to do it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;body-image&quot; data-component=&quot;ImageBlock&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;responsive-image__img&quot; alt=&quot;Roberta and Ken Williams at the groundbreaking ceremony for Sierra's On-Line's HQ.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;On February 12, Williams negotiated with Forbes’ team an offer of a tax-free stock exchange, in which each share of Sierra stock would be exchanged for 1.225 shares of CUC stock; with CUC’s stock valued at approximately $48 per share, this represented a premium of about 69% over Sierra’s actual trading price. As offers go, it was an extremely generous one to Sierra’s shareholders and employees—who generally held some amount of Sierra stock as part of their compensation package—and Williams and Roberta, whose 9% stake in the company would increase in value to $64.8 million. (In CUC stock.) Forbes boasted to Williams that CUC had “a long history” of “beating Wall Street expectations”; that its stock “consistently outperformed the market.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;64&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It was an offer Williams couldn’t refuse; at least not back in 1996, when he did not know the reason CUC consistently outperformed the market and could offer a billion dollars for Sierra was because it made numbers up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__body-heading&quot; data-component=&quot;HeadingBlock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__body-heading__heading heading2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Coupon for Magic Beans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Everyone told Williams not to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“They hated it,” he remembers of the board’s reaction. “Because we were on a roll. We were unstoppable at that point.” If it was an acquisition where Sierra would retain control, that’d be one thing, but a merger with three major developers under a parent with no software experience? &quot;It was beyond bad inside Sierra.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I didn’t want to sell it,” says Mike Brochu, a Texan who Williams hired in 1994 out of the finance world as Sierra’s chief financial officer, and who was promoted within a year to president and chief operating officer. A self-described hired gun, he was brought in to tighten up Sierra’s professional discipline and stuck around longer than intended after developing an unexpected affection for the business of game development and Williams personally. These days, Brochu talks about Sierra like a gunslinger about that ranch where he could have settled down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I pleaded with him,” says Jerry Bowerman, an MBA and investment banker who Williams had hired for a kind of apprentice role, and later progressed to vice president of product development. “It made my hair stand up on the back of my neck. Here's this company that sells a coupon, and it’s now going to own two to three entertainment software companies?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;44.114035087719&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Brochu and Bowerman were Williams’ lieutenants (“The three musketeers,” Bowerman says) and intimately involved in the crisis talks that followed Forbes’ offer, conducted in secret to avoid leaks that might impact the stock price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The other major voice in the room was Roberta. “I was not a fan of it. When Walter asked me did we ever think of selling the company and I said no, I meant it.” Like Brochu, she enjoyed what she was doing—at what other company and in what other time would a designer best known for fairy tale adventures be given millions of dollars, creative control, a brand new film studio with a live actors and full marketing support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW_d04W8QWY&quot;&gt;to make a violent and sexual Grand Guignol with puzzles?&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, she didn’t really trust Forbes. “I always had a little bit of intuition about Walter. Not that he was a crook or anything like that, just…. take him with a grain of salt.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta had tremendous influence on Ken’s decision-making, who particularly valued her read of people and character. “I can't tell you how many times in a meeting [where] we're trying to get Ken to make a decision, he would say ‘I need to sleep on it,’” says Bowerman. “That, I came to learn was code for, ‘I need to go home and talk it over with Roberta.’” Around 1984, the venture capitalists on Sierra’s board pushed a merger with an educational developer, Spinnaker, to which Roberta was opposed and Williams amenable. Roberta blew up the deal by arriving late to a meeting between Sierra and Spinnaker and declaring, “These guys are a joke.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;52.660877513711&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It wasn’t just Roberta who had his ear. Ken advertised himself as a leader open to persuasion. “Ken would look you straight in the eye and say, ‘Here’s what I think, but I can be convinced otherwise,’” says Brochu. “And he meant it. If you had a better argument or a better way or a different idea, he would listen. It wasn’t his way or the highway.” When designer Jane Jensen pitched Williams her steamy voodoo mystery &lt;em&gt;Gabriel Knight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “Nobody wants to play something dark and depressing on the computer,” but trusted her enough to greenlight it. In 1996, in spite of a personal distaste for violent shooters, he saw the potential in, and agreed to publish, &lt;em&gt;Half-Life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;But Bowerman—who says Williams viewed him as a protégé; that Williams once said “I was like the son he never had, even though he had two sons”—struggled to make the case against CUC. “Nobody beats Wall Street estimates exactly by a penny 24 quarters in a row,” he remembers warning Williams of CUC. “That’s categorically impossible. Does not happen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams took the deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;As he sees it, he didn’t have a choice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“Management has an obligation to look at the bigger picture and say, is this good for shareholders? At the time, I honestly thought it was.” The money was one thing, but CUC would theoretically provide the financial stability and resources for Sierra to continue its growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“You'd have to convince your shareholders that you can do a much better job if they didn't sell, and they're sitting on a pretty decent premium to sell. They invested in you for a reason and they want to make their money,” says Brochu, who saw the math, and did not fight the deal too hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta resisted. “But I was made to realize, and it was true,” she says, “that we kind of had to. The deal was so put-together and at the time Walter was very well thought of on Wall Street. CUC was a big deal and Walter was almost thought of as a god. I don’t know why, but he was.” And if a god offers you a billion dollar deal and you say no, “you could theoretically be sued by your shareholders.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;57&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;At least, you’d need an argument that the company would be better off not to sell. And Ken was tired.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“It was hard for Ken to try to really run and grow the company as it could be,” says Roberta. “He was experiencing a lot of stress and just didn't quite know what to do about that. So the idea for Ken of merging the company or selling was appealing to him just for that reason. I, on the other hand, was having a great time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams’ natural competitiveness and excitement to do new things with computers made him a good fit to lead a public company that fed on growth and expansion, but maybe in the same way that a lightbulb is a good fit to lead electricity. It would never have been enough, not for Williams nor the board, for Sierra to have levelled out as, say, a boutique producer of high-quality adventure games. Sierra needed to stake out territory on the internet even before modems were common in households. It didn’t have a footprint in Europe, so it had to buy a French developer. It didn’t make racing games, so it had to buy a company that did. Repeat with image editing software, landscape design software, golf games, submarine games. (Who looks around and says “I simply must own a company that makes submarine games”?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;58&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;A sale, to a massive and prosperous company like CUC, would not only relieve Williams of the headaches of investors and quarterly reports but guarantee the livelihoods of his thousand employees and their families. Williams had nearly lost it all years before: in 1982, at the urging of Sierra’s first set of venture capitalists, he agreed to pivot from computer software to video game cartridges for, e.g., the Atari; an industry that brutally crashed months later. “He had to mortgage his house to make payroll and still had to lay off the majority of the team,” says Bowerman. “It profoundly scarred Ken and Roberta. They took the responsibility as board members and Ken as CEO like ten times more seriously after that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It didn’t necessarily matter that CUC was not the buyer Williams ever would have expected. “The chance to be part of a $2 billion company that I thought was going places was exciting,” he says. “If all that happened was I got stuck running Sierra, that would be perfectly fun. Then I could actually get closer to the product. Or if I flipped over and ran NetMarket and was going into shopping, that could be fun. And if the worst happened and I was flushed out entirely, and all I had was a lot of money, that would be fun, too.” As early as 1980, Williams was dreaming of the kind of success that would allow him and Roberta to retire at thirty. “As fun as developing games are, when you've done it for, at that point, almost 18 years, that gets a little old.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Anyway, he had no choice. “He has a fiduciary responsibility, and the board has a fiduciary responsibility, to take the offer seriously,” says Bowerman. “All that's true. What they never &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do was, like, hire an investment bank to say, is this actually a fair offer?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Had they done so, they’d have found only confirmation that CUC was a healthy, hungry start-up well-liked by Wall Street. While CUC wouldn’t let Sierra see its internal financial data, it did have assurances from the Big Four accounting firm Ernst &amp;amp; Young that the books were not just in order but reflected a company so fabulously wealthy that it could pay for Sierra not with cash, but pieces of itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Still. Roberta had a vibe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;On February 20, 1996, less than three weeks after Forbes floated the idea, CUC announced that Sierra and Davidson were to be acquired for $1.06 and $1.14 billion respectively in CUC stock. Broderbund and LucasArts were out. “We just weren’t interested at their price, nor in being acquired for stock in their company,” says Broderbund founder Doug Carlston. “It was a short meeting.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“This acquisition represents an opportunity for Sierra to capitalise on what we already do extremely well: develop the highest-quality interactive entertainment, education and productivity titles in the industry,” Williams said in a press release. “CUC brings potentially 40 million new consumers in the interactive marketplace. We’re looking forward to growing this business with CUC and reaching every one of those customers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;CUC’s stock fell 17 percent. Sierra and Davidson’s stock, after an initial surge, followed it down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes assured the markets that all would be well. “Our goal is to be the largest content provider in the electronic marketplace,” he said. “There’s a new age coming—and if you believe in that then you have to like the moves we’re making.” When an analyst who downgraded CUC’s stock questioned the wisdom of a $2 billion acquisition as CUC’s first step into the software industry, Forbes defended the move as the literally only way CUC could do business. “We’re owners. We don’t like joint ventures…. we don’t want to share any of this.” Not only would the acquisition of Sierra and Davidson allow CUC to compete with Microsoft and Disney in entertainment and edutainment, Forbes said, but the developers could also work on “a more attractive interface” for the CUC website; so, there were lots of ways in which CUC would benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Reaction inside Sierra—where the news broke via an email from Williams shortly in advance of the press release—was puzzled. “I don’t think it’s inaccurate to say that none of us had any idea what CUC International was,” says a senior artist with Sierra at the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Craig Alexander, then the general manager of Sierra’s Oakhurst studio, agrees. “It seemed odd because they weren’t a media company. We always assumed we'd be bought by a large media concern or Hollywood studio or a technology company.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;70&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It scared Al Lowe, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt;. “When CUC took over, [they said] ‘We love the company. That’s why we bought it.’ Translated into English, that means, ‘We're going to change everything.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Bob Davidson, the chief executive officer of Davidson and Associates, acknowledged that similar acquisitions had failed in the past, but one thing about CUC gave him confidence. He had visited CUC’s headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and had been “amazed” to find that despite CUC reporting annual sales of over a billion dollars, there were just twenty people in the office. What work ethic; what an entrepreneurial culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__body-heading&quot; data-component=&quot;HeadingBlock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__body-heading__heading heading2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Point of No Return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;There’s a problem, Mike Brochu told Williams. Although the acquisition had been announced, the deal would not close until July, and apparently Davidson’s sales team was advising Walmart’s buyers to hold off on ordering Sierra games. Soon, Davidson would be taking over and selling Sierra products at a discount.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams knew of no decision about consolidating the sales teams. He’d been promised by Forbes that Sierra and Davidson would operate independently, at least at first. If Davidson proved to have the superior sales force, then fine, he’d happily use them instead, but at least let him make the argument. He’d personally brokered a new power structure with Forbes specifically so he’d have that opportunity: CUC’s combined software division would be run by a tripartite Office of the President consisting of Ken, Bob Davidson, and a CUC executive, Chris McLeod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;72&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes said he didn’t know what the Davidson rep was talking about, but acknowledged that Williams was unhappy. The board was urging Williams to exercise a clause in the acquisition agreement that allowed Sierra to terminate the deal if, before July, CUC’s average stock price fell below $29. It had.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams says now, and said to Forbes then, that he was ready to walk away. Forbes assured him the stock price would rally; that he himself was out there on Wall Street, pounding the pavement, working investors. What if, Forbes said, he added Brochu to the software board, and made Williams a CUC vice-chairman, and put him on the CUC board? And remember NetMarket, Forbes told Williams: that’s the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“Ken was so enamored with Walter, and Walter was such a smooth talker,” says Bowerman. “Ken [is] singularly motivated by money, and [he] saw Walter flying in these private jets, buying expensive wine, staying in a nice hotel…. [he became] a fan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“Ken is a very nice person,” says Roberta. “You might say he’s nicer than I am. And he is very trusting. He’s actually too trusting to be a CEO of a company, in some ways. He doesn’t ever like to see a bad side of anybody. During our whole run of Sierra, from starting it to selling it, I’ve occasionally said to Ken, ‘You know that person? I really have to question that person, and whether we should work with them.’ And he would always be a little offended that I would think that way about someone. He would. He tended to be trustful.”i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;73.516167664671&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams says the issue is he always wanted to be the nice guy. As a boss, in some ways, that helped him: he encouraged challenge and critique and didn’t take either personally. The flip side was he “had a hard time, and still [does], saying things that upset people.” For layoffs, or mandating overtime on holiday weekends, he relied upon Brochu and Bowerman. “If I was the one who had to sit across the table and give them bad news, that would be much tougher. It’s nice to have some layers between you and the damage you cause, I guess I’d say.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;If Williams killed the deal, Forbes would be pissed, but if he trusted that Forbes was right, that he could resuscitate the stock price—well, then, everyone would win. And that was what happened. CUC’s stock recovered, even surpassing its earlier levels. The deal to acquire Sierra closed on July 24, 1996. Everyone was rich and Williams was the nice guy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Bowerman remembers a Paris dinner in celebration of the closing, where Forbes ordered a $5,000 bottle of wine, and soothed the startled table with a promise he would pay for it personally. “I find out after the fact, digging around in the accounting systems, that he'd expensed it,” Bowerman says. “So he was just a liar. Just a very fat liar.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__body-heading&quot; data-component=&quot;HeadingBlock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__body-heading__heading heading2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sleight of Hand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Henry Silverman thought Walter Forbes was a clown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;A no-bullshit, numbers-driven corporate raider (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1997/10/27/233303/index.htm&quot;&gt;“the king of franchising,” as per Fortune&lt;/a&gt;), Silverman was not as enamored of Forbes’s visionary swagger as some, but he was somewhat persuaded by CUC’s earnings. &quot;What turns him on is watching the stock price go up,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;said Silverman’s long-time colleague Steve Holmes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;60.22131147541&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Not enough to sell his company—HFS, an owner and licensor of hotel, real estate and car rental brands like Days Inn, Ramada and Avis—when Forbes asked, but he did agree to merge their businesses. In December 1997, just over a year after the Sierra deal closed, CUC and HFS became Cendant Corporation, the 72nd most valuable company in the United States, one place ahead of Merrill Lynch. Forbes envisioned it as the “the premier consumer services company,” through which, e.g., any hotel guest, homebuyer or car renter at HFS’ brands could be enrolled in CUC’s marketing databases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;As part of the deal, Silverman would serve as Cendant’s chief executive and Forbes as chairman, and switch jobs in 2000. Forbes had preserved CUC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;“financial-reporting autonomy”&lt;/a&gt; by keeping in post CUC’s chief financial officer Cosmo Corigliano and corporate controller Anne Pember. All CUC’s financial reporting would be filtered through those two; neither Silverman nor his team would have direct access to the data. Even during merger negotiations, CUC had refused to share its private financials with HFS, out of supposed concern that HFS might then decide to purchase a competitor instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It all seemed strange to Silverman. “[But] every time I was nervous, they would show up with another quarter of spectacular earnings,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;he said.&lt;/a&gt; “This business was producing 20% to 30% growth in a company where nobody worked…. this could be a gold mine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;59.07783641161&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In January, a month after the merger, Silverman asked Corigliano and CUC president Kirk Shelton to start furnishing him with daily cash-flow figures. That was how Silverman operated: hands on, needed the numbers. Corigliano and Shelton said they were not really used to producing reports like that. Silverman said to do it anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“They were like children playing at business,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;complained Cendant’s general counsel James Buckman&lt;/a&gt;; to him, to Silverman and the HFS guys, CUC’s comparatively relaxed corporate culture and Forbes’ tendencies to brainstorm in bare feet, golf every other afternoon and take two months’ vacation each year was obnoxious and unserious. &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;CUC, however, took it as a badge of honor&lt;/a&gt;: despite growing into a billion-dollar business, they’d never lost the entrepreneurial spirit of their start-up youth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;By March, Corigliano and Shelton hadn’t sent the figures, nor provided any information for Cendant’s first annual report to the SEC. With the filing deadline for the latter fast approaching, Forbes yielded CUC’s autonomy and let an antsy Silverman put his own team on the project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Looking at CUC’s books was to see the thing behind the dumpster in &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/em&gt;. In its 1997 and 1998 budgets, CUC had put aside $165 million for one-off merger costs, but had not spent it. Now, they were proposing to declare that money as new income. Cendant’s chief accounting officer remembers Kirk Shelton saying, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;“We want you to help us figure out how to creatively do this.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;71.442687747036&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Shelton denies making that comment, and in any event, the CUC executive did not try to induct Silverman’s people into the scheme. Instead, both CUC and Ernst &amp;amp; Young assured Silverman that all suspicious-looking transfers—there were more, going back a year—were easily explained and of no concern. Silverman had Forbes, Shelton and Corigliano sign affidavits to that effect, and submitted the whole package to the SEC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Silverman was furious, and while Forbes denied all knowledge—he was a big-picture visionary, he reminded Silverman, &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;who “never ran the shop”&lt;/a&gt;—he agreed to hash it out after returning from his Hawaiian vacation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;On April 1, Silverman met with Forbes and said it would be appropriate for the latter to step down. Forbes agreed, then after the meeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;disregarded the suggestion.&lt;/a&gt; “I didn’t take it very seriously.”  By April 9, however, Kirk Shelton, Cosmo Corigliano and Anne Pember had resigned. “Cosmo was well-thought [of],” &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/1998/04/16/companies/cendant/&quot;&gt;said one analyst.&lt;/a&gt; “People were surprised and took it as something was going on.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;That day, at the request of the New York Stock Exchange, Cendant agreed to a short halt on trading. Silverman got on a conference call with analysts to assure them that the executive departures were no harbinger of anything dramatic, merely growing pains. Anyway, he said, just look at the earnings for this last year. Spectacular.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;As soon as he hung up, he got a call from Cendant’s chief financial officer, who said actually, it is a lot worse than we thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;84&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__body-heading&quot; data-component=&quot;HeadingBlock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__body-heading__heading heading2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The New Boss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;There’s a secret of business that Ken Williams says he learned from Bill Gates. Ask an executive or a prospective hire for their golf handicap, and if they give an answer, write that person off. Serious executives don’t play golf. Williams kept that in mind at his first CUC board meeting in New York, late 1996. The board began with a robust round of golf talk, while Williams sat silently and strategically for the opportunity to demonstrate that he was a real businessman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“How’s business?” someone finally asked Walter Forbes, after an hour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“It’s good,” Forbes said, and ended the meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams left in shock. It was one thing not to understand CUC’s business model from the outside, but how could he be there in the board meeting and still not really know what the company did? “They were a joke,” says Jerry Bowerman. “The average board member was like 80 years old. They fell asleep during the meetings. It was something else.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Another surprise: Williams had begun his career at CUC expecting to convene the first meeting of the conglomerate’s software board, with himself, Bob Davidson, Mike Brochu and Chris McLeod as equal partners. But there was no software board, and Bob Davidson was his boss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams had been social, but not close, with Davidson, a former engineering and construction executive who ran his wife Jan’s educational software studio. “There was no fooling around,” with Davidson, says Mike Albanese, a veteran software producer at the company. “It was all sales, sales, sales, make the product, sell the product. In meetings, someone would complain that product development was a month behind and Bob's response was ‘Sell what you have now.’” That was the kind of thing Williams would say, too, and Williams did think Davidson was a smart guy.  He looked forward, or was at least clear-eyed, about working alongside Davidson through a transition period to merge their respective companies under CUC. “If it turned out that my CFO wasn’t the better CFO, and we had to swap to their CFO,” he says, “I’m not gonna cry about that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;68&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Instead, Davidson moved quickly and unilaterally to consolidate all CUC’s software units under his aegis, notwithstanding the power-sharing agreement Williams had negotiated with Forbes. Davidson was the chief executive officer of CUC Software: there was no software board. Brochu remembers Davidson saying Brochu worked for him. Brochu replied, “No, I don’t,” and walked out of Davidson’s office, never to return.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“There was a cultural clash,” says Brochu, “a rigidity to the way Bob wanted it. We said, no, we were pretty successful doing it the way we’ve been doing it, we’ll keep on keepin’ on. ‘No, you’ve got to do it this way.’ We weren’t compatible. He was way, way, way more buttoned up than we were.” Brochu remembers in the early meetings about consolidating staff, Davidson was particularly forceful that his team outperformed their Sierra counterparts. “I would always say, just because you say it real loud and real fast doesn’t make it true. But he could make it sound true. Way better, to be fair, way better than Ken could.” Brochu used to play poker with Williams: he remembers him as a player who’d consistently bet when he had a good hand and never when he didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams went over Davidson’s head to Walter Forbes’ deputy Kirk Shelton. “Below is my analysis of the three options facing you,” he wrote Shelton in an email. Those options were to fire Davidson, fire Williams, or—Williams’ preference—allow Williams to operate Sierra as a semi-autonomous development studio with Davidson as publisher. “Bob dislikes this option,” Williams acknowledged, and indeed it came to nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;63&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In a later email, Williams pitched Shelton “a radical thought,” whereby he would be made president and chief operating officer of CUC Software to Davidson’s chief executive. “I will report to Bob and everything else will report to me…. I have tremendous respect for Bob and would not ignore his good ideas. Hopefully, by now, you’ve figured out that I am a reasonable person to work with.” Whereas, he added, “I believe Bob has an ego problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;CUC was not unhappy to have Davidson in charge. “[Davidson] had a tight-running machine,” says Bowerman. “He also had Blizzard, which was the hidden crown jewel in the whole thing. [And] when you met with them, you walked away so impressed. Even though they weren't selling a lot of software, their system processes, their discipline, how they approached market research and development… they were pretty buttoned-up and [Davidson] didn't have a creative bone in his body, but if you took personalities and emotions out of it, they were running a better business than we were.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Nonetheless, Shelton tried to appease Williams out of concern that his departure would inspire a mass exodus at Sierra. He tried to mediate. “What’s worked well for CUC is to have a small group of very good people and work very closely. I hope we can do the same for Software,” he wrote to Davidson and Williams in late 1996. “The key is making sure that you both are comfortable working together and have a clear understanding of what each needs…. Ken needs for his remaining organization not to feel subordinated to the Davidson organization. And if you can cooperate as peers, I think Sierra can retain its uniqueness and creativity, which I think are crucial.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;62.899838449111&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“Your e-mail suggests you may not have all the facts,” Davidson replied. “Both my employment contract and the consolidation memo indicate that I do have overall management responsibility for all the software business within CUC, including Sierra. There is simply no way we would have sold to CUC under any other circumstances. Jan and I and our board of directors were given absolute assurance that we would retain overall management control of all software units. It is unthinkable that CUC would default on its promise.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams had asked Forbes for compromise. Davidson had asked for control. Forbes said yes to both. Each promise was worth about the same in that they proposed incompatible realities, with Forbes evincing little interest in which one manifested. Davidson won out because Williams thought he would be rewarded for being reasonable, and Davidson knew it didn’t have to work that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;By the end of 1996, it was clear to Williams that he’d lost control of the company he founded. He left Sierra to run Forbes’ pet NetMarket project, expecting one day to return.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__body-heading&quot; data-component=&quot;HeadingBlock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__body-heading__heading heading2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crime Scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;A year and a half later, two CUC managers revealed to Cendant’s chief financial officer that they had been instructed by executives to inflate revenue through fabricated income and arbitrary adjustments &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;“to meet Wall Street expectations,”&lt;/a&gt; and that this had been going on for years. One of the whistleblowers &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; being told by Anne Pember that it was too suspicious to declare fake income in excess of five million; much better to make it under three, and add a random number of pennies at the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;On April 15, 1998, Cendant announced that the earnings it had declared for 1997 would need to be revised down by about $115 million. &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;The next day,&lt;/a&gt; Cendant’s stock dropped from $36 to $19, erasing $14 billion from its market capitalization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;70.343347639485&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes said he was shocked. As a visionary, he was naturally unaware of things that happened at this level. And are we sure, he said, that all this was not just made up by Henry Silverman to effect a coup?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;An emergency meeting of the board, deadlocked by competing loyalties, took no action against either Forbes or Kirk Shelton. “It's wrong to assume that I'm going anywhere,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/04/business/chairman-seeks-to-end-uncertainty-over-cendant.html&quot;&gt;Forbes told the New York Times,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/11/09/250846/index.htm&quot;&gt;and to Silverman&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;it appears that you are hell-bent on ‘bashing’ CUC.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Cendant hired an accounting firm to look into the supposed fraud, and in July, investigators reported a pattern at CUC of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbronline.com/news/cendant_to_restate_figures_after_intent_to_deceive/&quot;&gt;“accounting errors made with an intent to deceive.”&lt;/a&gt; Over at least three years, CUC had declared half a billion dollars in revenue that, in fact, did not exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__body-heading&quot; data-component=&quot;HeadingBlock&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__body-heading__heading heading2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Palace Coup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Ed Heinbockel, Sierra’s former CFO, says Roberta Williams saw herself as the Steven Spielberg of gaming, and she was about as close as anyone. A star name and hit-maker whose each title manifested an incremental leap forward in production design—professional voice casts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGlCjVVXy9c&amp;amp;ab_channel=ozmodiar88&quot;&gt;CGI cinematics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P8UITu8Faw&amp;amp;ab_channel=ZarlaSheenaza&quot;&gt;Disneyesque animation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69M2iiI__XQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=lamllemaussade&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;—while iterating on standards of game design and accessibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“When I do a project, I wonder if there are any Roberta Williams games shipping at the same time,” &lt;em&gt;Gabriel Knight&lt;/em&gt;’s Jane Jensen said in 1997. “Because, if there are, I know I am going to get the short end of the marketing budget.” At Williams’ Sierra, budgets were directly proportional to past sales figures, and when designers told Williams that they’d be able to do more &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; more, Williams replied, “It doesn’t work like that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;63&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I absolutely played favorites,” he writes, “and the rules were simple. Ship a best-selling game and you are my favorite person. Ship a dog and you should start looking for work…. If someone needed my help or for me to go out on a limb on their behalf, favoritism counted.” If that’s a contradiction in Williams’ nice guy persona, it’s not a complicated one: he was the nicer guy to people who made him money. &lt;em&gt;Quest for Glory&lt;/em&gt;’s Corey Cole freely compares Williams to Donald Trump.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta felt keenly the constant expectation to up the ante. It wasn’t just her name and her games: &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt; was Sierra’s tentpole, and its fortunes had always corresponded to those of the company. By the sale to CUC in 1996, she had begun early work on the eighth &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt;, which would be Sierra’s first adventure in real-time 3D, with a camera moving behind the player character. “Classic adventure games were starting to feel a little bit dated,” she says, and she was eager to figure out how the old format could be translated to a full 3D environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The game, subtitled &lt;em&gt;Mask of Eternity,&lt;/em&gt; was Roberta’s first under CUC and the first to bring her back into the office: she’d become accustomed to working from home and having development teams come to her, but this would be such a project she felt she needed to be in the office full-time. When she got there, and saw what the team were building, she didn’t recognize it. “I started looking at it and going, ‘What is this?’ I mean, experience points? They had completely redesigned the interface. It looked like an RPG. And [they] said, ‘Don’t worry about it. This is the future.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta remembers her producer, Mark Seibert, suggesting that her formalist adventure game design could be expanded to include combat and bring &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt; more in line with RPGs like Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Diablo.&lt;/em&gt; “I would say, this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; a role-playing game. This is an &lt;em&gt;adventure&lt;/em&gt; game. It’s completely different,” she says. “But the argument the team would get back to me was, ‘Yeah, but role-playing games are in now. That’s the thing.’ And it’s true. They weren’t lying.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;63&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta would remove the more overt RPG aspects, only for them to be put back in, and her changes taken out. It was not, she acknowledges, a way to work, and her team agreed. “My team wasn’t listening to me,” she says. “They were kind of telling me that I could go home and they’d call me if they needed me. It was rude, frankly.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Mask of Eternity&lt;/em&gt; was definitely being pushed around by many forces,” says Mark Seibert. Ken Williams thinks it was about Davidson leveraging the &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt; brand into a more profitable direction; Seibert suggests it was an early indication of a larger marketing department, newly empowered under CUC, that was “not excited about internal development teams.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;At home, Roberta would tell Ken her game was being ruined. “I don’t want to say I cried, but I cried, you know. I’m not a person who does that. I’m really not a person who does that. I was very, very upset.” Ken says even in the old days, it was not uncommon for developers on Roberta’s teams to go over her head and complain to him. He’d confirm her authority as the project lead, and that’d be that. This time, first mired in conflict with Davidson and then out of software entirely, he couldn’t do anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;73.196622436671&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta, they suspected, was on the shit-list anyway: they believed CUC, and later Cendant, had intentionally stopped marketing the more controversial Sierra games, including her blank check &lt;em&gt;Phantasmagoria&lt;/em&gt;. “Henry Silverman isn’t sure he wants to sell &lt;em&gt;Phantasmagoria&lt;/em&gt;,” Williams remembers being told. During the development of &lt;em&gt;Mask of Eternity&lt;/em&gt;, Cendant further alienated Roberta by sending her an unexplained royalty statement indicating that she owed Sierra money. “I had done a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; for Sierra,” she says. “I felt like they would just love it to pick me up and boot me out if they could.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Cendant wanted &lt;em&gt;Mask of Eternity&lt;/em&gt; out by Christmas, and as that deadline grew increasingly close and unachievable, Ken and Roberta took that moment to point out that, despite repeated requests on her part, she had not signed a contract, and would walk away and publicly disavow the game if she were not brought back into the fold with a meaningful role. Cendant acquiesced, in the last months of development, to let Roberta claw the game somewhat back to her original vision in the short time that remained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I signed my contract after it shipped,” Roberta says. ”I waited, because I didn’t trust them. They wanted it very, very badly, and I wanted them to basically, kiss my ass, a little bit. If that sounds arrogant, you know, I'm sorry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He would also face questions over hundreds of thousands in unexplained cash advances and corporate credit card bills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“Sixty-one percent of your revenue was not there,&quot; replied a Cendant vice-chairman at a board meeting. “You were the CEO. You had a responsibility to know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Although Cendant’s board could not muster the votes to fire Forbes, he left of his own accord, with $12.5 million in Cendant stock options. The value of those stocks had been slashed from a high of $41 per share to $10, but Forbes, having pocketed another $35 million in cash, would not have been overly concerned. He transferred all his property into his wife’s name and killed a few years developing and playing on golf courses until he, with Kirk Shelton, was charged with accounting and securities fraud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Silverman, minus hair, weight, and $800 million of his net worth, was left reigning over a house of cards on fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Veil Lifts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In January 1997, Bob Davidson, weeks after successfully asserting that he and he alone ran CUC Software, quit the company. According to Kirk Shelton, in the days immediately prior, Davidson had sold off much of his CUC stock and presented an ultimatum: if CUC’s software units were not spun off as their own company with Davidson as CEO, he and Jan Davidson would leave. Forbes and Shelton replied that they hadn’t acquired Sierra and Davidson only to unacquire them months later. Davidson acknowledged this—it was an unlikely demand—and resigned. Strange moves at the time, but wise ones to make if you had any idea of what was coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;67&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams, in online shopping exile, expected Davidson’s departure to clear the path for his return. Instead, CUC appointed long-time executive Chris McLeod. “I thought it was a dumb move,” Williams says, “but my job was to try to make it successful, not to grumble about it. I was trying to be a good soldier.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams spent 1997 planning how to make CUC’s NetMarket &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; online shopping destination, though he didn’t view this as a demotion. NetMarket was Forbes’ favorite child: his talked-up moonshot that would cement CUC’s dominion in the online future that was coming for everyone. Both Forbes and Williams saw how dramatically the internet would transform all business, and though Williams’ first attempt to capitalize on that with the Sierra Network had failed, here was another, grander chance. (Although NetMarket was not Forbes’ &lt;em&gt;idea,&lt;/em&gt; but another acquisition.) Williams had been flattered to think that Sierra was acquired because while software was all well and good, it was really his experience with the internet that would make NetMarket change the world. “They let Ken believe that because of his business acumen, and because of what he'd done with Sierra and founding it, that he would be heir apparent to Walter,” says Bowerman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In the summer, Forbes invited Williams to pitch his plan for NetMarket at a management retreat in Vail, Colorado, where he owned a golf course. “They shit all over it,” says Bowerman. Williams felt humiliated and ignored. “We said, ‘NetMarket’s the future, we just need a few million dollars,’” says Bowerman. “They lost it. We thought we were doing something really innovative—and we were—but we didn’t understand the bigger picture.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;51&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;That being, among other things, CUC was then courting a merger with Henry Silverman’s HFS, and probably wondering whether they could get away with telling them that they didn’t need to see the financials. “I was talking about investing and servers and building software,” says Williams, “and I think they were focused on the issues that ultimately sent them to jail.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Kens left the Vail meeting and vented to Roberta over the phone. Forbes had treated him like a little boy. He wasn’t allowed to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Roberta hung up and went to bed. “This feeling of dread came over me,” she says. “I know this is gonna sound weird, but it’s true. I got up the next day, and I said to Ken, we have to sell our stock. I mean &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Closing Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Jerry Bowerman thinks he was the only Sierra employee to cash out when the CUC stock was still trading at around $40 a share; he estimates he got millions out of the affair. Enough things had tipped him off: Davidson’s departure, CUC estimating for accounting purposes that the useful life of a game developer’s computer was seven to eight years, Forbes and his $5,000 wine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“It’s a house of cards,” he told Williams. “Get out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Williams felt burned from the NetMarket pitch and Forbes’ misrepresentations about how things would work with Davidson, but he made a move only at Roberta’s urging. “I saw a lot of the lies during the purchase as them telling me what I wanted to hear, but Roberta is much more passionate than that,” he says. “Lie to her, that’s it, you’ve crossed the line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;78&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I don’t like how we have no control anymore,” Roberta told Ken. “You and I don’t have any idea what’s going on. All of our net worth, all of our twenty years of running Sierra, is on the line. Something doesn’t feel right to me. I’m extremely uncomfortable having everything we’ve worked for under the control of these people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Ken, already inclined to resign, called his stockbroker and sold everything he could. Roberta advised friends to sell. “I probably shouldn’t have done that,” she says. “And they didn’t, because the stock was doing really well at the time, and supposedly still going to go up, up and up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Ken left CUC and Sierra on November 1, 1997. Roberta, her stock options almost all divested, stayed to finish out &lt;em&gt;Mask of Eternity&lt;/em&gt;. One month later, CUC and HFS merged to form Cendant, and Henry Silverman told Kirk Shelton and Cosmo Corigliano he needed to see the books.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It never did make much sense for CUC to acquire software companies. In August 1998, with Cendant bleeding, Henry Silverman saw no reason to keep them. “I think he took the attitude that he wished he had never heard of CUC and couldn't get rid of all their stuff fast enough,” says Williams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“We inherited the business,” a Cendant spokesman told the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; of the software units. “It’s not part of our core strategic business model.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Bad news travels in all-staff emails within minutes of a press release. On April 15, 1998, employees at Sierra learned of CUC’s exaggerated accounting along with the rest of the world. Internally, anger and dread prevailed. For some, it was clarifying. “These little conversations stick out,” says Craig Alexander. “I remember CUC or Cendant management lecturing me and my leadership about why we couldn’t deliver revenue and earnings on a quarterly basis. They were all proud of the fact that they had been delivering to Wall Street expectations for the last four or five years. ‘How come you guys can’t do that?’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;79&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Stock options had long been a major part of the Sierra compensation package, so most employees and former employees were affected by the overnight collapse in Cendant’s share price, and its continued fall. “I had a fair amount of my net worth at the time tied up in that stock,” says Mike Brochu. “Holy crap, it just plummeted to nothing.” Leslie Balfour, a writer and producer at Sierra until late 1997 saw her stock fall from $100,000 to $20,000. Al Lowe says he and his wife lost “the equivalent of a really nice home.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Mike Albanese remembers colleagues from Davidson calling him in a panic. Just months before, they’d been telling him about something called “salary replacement,” whereby CUC was offering employee salary reductions in exchange for stock options. Albanese hadn’t taken that deal; in fact, he’d left Cendant and cashed out, really just in time. “Leaving Cendant was the best thing that ever happened to me in my life next to my wife and child.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Less fortunate were the Sierra employees who’d borrowed on their stock options to buy houses, whose banks called in their loans when the stock fell and had to declare bankruptcy. “One of my employees,” Bowerman says, “went from being on paper a millionaire to being hundreds of thousands in debt with no way of payment. There were just dozens of horror stories like that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Here it was again: the video game crash, 1983, Williams having to lay off almost everyone at Sierra. It was happening again, and this time because of what Williams had done to prevent its recurrence. “A lot of these people were there because of me,” he says now. “You know, kick me and I get hurt and get back up or something, but kicking people around me and bankrupting them; that’s not nice, it’s really painful, and multiply that times a thousand people. Gosh, how do you do that? I’m not a particularly empathetic person or somebody that feels others’ pains. But man, that crossed the threshold. That goes into crazy land, just seeing things destroyed. It was the company, it was the shareholders, it was the employees, it was the contractors, everybody got hurt. That’s a level of pain that you just… unimaginable.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;56.658362989324&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In August 1998, Cendant declared its software business incompatible with its core strategic direction and, in a move that cheered analysts, put it up for sale. A deal was struck in November with Havas, a subsidiary of French telecommunications giant Vivendi, to purchase all of Cendant’s software studios for $1 billion—this time, in cash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“There were some feelings of relief in thinking that the company was going to make it out of the Cendant mess,” remembers a senior artist with Sierra at the time. “[But] it was another sale to a company no one knew anything about… there was just a heavy sense that something was sure to change.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Three months later, the majority of Sierra’s staff were laid off and its studios closed, in order to effect a dramatic refocus of Sierra’s efforts away from software development to the internet and online gaming platforms. Don’t worry about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/1999/02/22/life/q_sierra/&quot;&gt;Sierra assured the public.&lt;/a&gt; This is the future. Blizzard Entertainment, Havas’ other acquisition, would reach that future faster and better with its Battle.net platform and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;; in 2004, Sierra was shuttered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“They killed it,” says Williams. “It didn't die. They killed it.” In a consolatory email sent around that day, he struggled for the right words. “There is really nothing good that can be said.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;And yet this marked also the fulfilment of that golden dream: the Californian dream for which Williams’ parents set out from Kentucky, and the teenaged Williams slung newspapers, initiated himself into the mysteries of computers and courted the fancy girl who lived in the house on the hill. “From the day I was old enough to know what it meant, I dreamed about someday being the CEO of a public company,” he writes. “To me this would represent the pinnacle of success.” It was what he’d told Steven Levy, the author of &lt;em&gt;Hackers&lt;/em&gt;, back in 1982, that he wanted: to make enough that he and Roberta could retire at thirty with all the money that they and their children could ever want to spend. They weren’t thirty, but they were close, and he had got them there: retirement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;83.596612779061&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“The first year after I was no longer part of it, and I wasn’t doing games anymore,” says Roberta, “I went into a year of… I don’t want to say ‘depression,’ I’m not a person that does that. I’m generally more of an upbeat, optimistic type of person. But I would say, I went through a period of, ‘What am I going to do now?’ And sadness. I still feel sad. In fact, just telling you this, I feel sad. You know, I’ve got a lump in my throat just telling you. Sierra was our baby. We loved… and I loved… our company and what we did, and [we were] so proud of it, and I loved my job. For twenty years I had been a computer game designer, and I was no longer that. It was like, ‘Well, now what am I?’ I was only about 42 years old. A little young yet to not have anything to do. What do I do?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;On July 20, 2018, Walter Forbes was released from the Federal Correctional Institute, Otisville in New York, a medium-security prison later to be occupied by Michael Cohen, the Situation, and Fyre Festival’s Billy McFarland. Forbes was convicted in 2007—after two mistrials—on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and two counts of making false statements, and sentenced to 151 months in prison and to make restitution in the order of $3.28 billion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Ruling-in-exec-s-divorce-case-returns-estate-to-253760.php&quot;&gt;The house he’d transferred to his wife was returned to him, by court order, to be divvied up between the government and Cendant.&lt;/a&gt; Kirk Shelton was sentenced to 10 years and the same amount in restitution. (Since his release, Forbes, now 77, has remained out of the public eye and did not respond to various and repeated attempts to contact him for this article.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes and Shelton always maintained they were unaware of the fraud that had been going on at CUC, and while they didn’t convince a jury—at least, not the third one—they have found in Ken Williams, at least, a sympathetic ear. “I’m still not 100% convinced he was guilty,” he says. “The best I can say is I &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; he was. It's just so out of character from the Walter that I saw that it's tough to believe.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It is difficult for Williams to reconcile Forbes’ alleged fraud with the kind of person he was: ”an impressive Harvard graduate and a Wall Street hero,” as he writes approvingly, “known to many of the world’s rich and famous.” Did Forbes, he wonders, truly have a jury &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;his peers&lt;/em&gt;, qualified to render judgement on the nuances of corporate finance? It did take three trials for a conviction. Was he thrown under the bus by his employees, who in testifying against him avoided prison themselves?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;body-image&quot; data-component=&quot;ImageBlock&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;body-image__img&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;responsive-image__img&quot; alt=&quot;In a gentle snow, Walter Forbes arrives at court surrounded by attorneys. He is dressed in a sweater and scarf, with his jacket open. We see him from a distance. His lawyers look defeated. He seems angry or confident.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;138&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Yes, Williams acknowledges, Forbes lied to him during the acquisition process, but that’s just “hardball business tactics.” A criminal conspiracy is a different story, and he wants to believe Forbes and Shelton’s side. He always kind of did. “If you were at dinner with Kirk Shelton and talking to him, you would definitely believe him. He seemed an honorable business guy, as did Walter.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“To this day,” he writes, “I am only 99% convinced that Walter was a crook. It remains unimaginable to me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Jerry Bowerman scoffs at this. “Walter is 100% a crook.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“The laws of accounting in the United States are mysterious,” Al Lowe allows. “You would think things would be cut and dried. It's just a bunch of numbers. But the way you apply those numbers and the way you name them, and allocate them, is very up for interpretation. I'm sure on some planet, there's an interpretation that Forbes did nothing wrong. It was just the way he kept his books. Myself, I like to make him a villain. Because he cost me a house, man.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I definitely think he's a crook,” says Roberta Williams. “But remember, Ken is nice. Ken likes to always look on the bright side or the nice side of everyone. In fact, that frustrates me. I mean, it's a good quality. I think probably more people should have that quality of looking at the bright side. But I think, between Ken and I, I'm probably a little bit more realistic in judging people. I'm more liable to say what I think. Ken likes to hedge his words. He likes to be very careful. And he always wants to be a nice guy [whom] nobody ever thinks anything bad about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It is not, to be fair, just Ken Williams who believed—still believes?—in the walking dream of Walter Forbes. Bob Davidson believed it was sensible for twenty people in an office selling coupons over the phone to acquire the world’s foremost educational software developer for a billion dollars. Henry Silverman, a micro-manager fixated on figures, believed it was an unmissable opportunity to merge his billion-dollar business with one whose accounts he wasn’t allowed to see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;All smart people who responded to the same thing in Walter Forbes: an offering of wealth and power by a man who had both. This beautiful man who said to trust him, and in spite of misgivings they did, because they were hungry. And why would it ever seem like a lie, when you think someone like Forbes—Wall Street, Harvard, C-suite—is exactly the kind of person who is supposed to have billions of dollars? Of course Forbes should have it; of course, they should too. This was the way it was supposed to work. We get bigger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In 1998, before the fall, Ken Williams passed on a personal offer from Jeff Bezos to help develop Amazon, for his own venture, WorldStream, that would bring talk radio to the internet. Jerry Bowerman followed him. “He is the only visionary I’ve worked for,” Bowerman says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;What do you think, Williams asked Bowerman, about Walter Forbes, as an investor? Forbes was not yet a disgraced convict, just the man who’d lied to Williams and by neglect pushed him out of Sierra and CUC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;“I’m like, are you out of your mind?” says Bowerman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes came by for the meeting, handing his jacket to Bowerman. You’ll like this, Williams pitched him. Talk radio, on the internet, with the technology underpinning it also supporting remote business communications. Hundreds of people on a call together, on the internet. They already had it working.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;This was the future, Williams believed, and he still saw Forbes as his kindred spirit. Hadn’t he and Forbes always been on the same page about the internet? The Sierra Network, NetMarket, online shopping, and now this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Forbes watched the demo with noticeable disinterest. Williams was unsettled: the two of them, Forbes and Williams, everyone had always said they were visionaries. We look at the horizon, Williams thought, and we see the same thing. Don’t we see the same thing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
