<title>How I built a keyboard/video/mouse switch for my two 4k monitors</title>
<link>https://haim.dev/posts/2020-07-28-dual-monitor-kvm/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://haim.dev/posts/2020-07-28-dual-monitor-kvm/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary ‚Äúmain‚Äù PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I‚Äôd like to easily switch where these peripheral devices are connected to, and that‚Äôs the traditional role of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch&quot;&gt;KVM switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn‚Äôt find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switch USB devices in hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To switch USB devices, I ordered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO&quot;&gt;this USB 3.0 two-computer switch&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon, that‚Äôs $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To automatically switch monitor inputs, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch&quot;&gt;wrote some software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a configured device is connected, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI&quot;&gt;DDC/CI&lt;/a&gt; to send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch back to the input that actually supplies video output).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two times: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS&quot;&gt;once in Swift&lt;/a&gt;, for MacOS, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows&quot;&gt;second time in Rust&lt;/a&gt;, for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed instantaneously, it feels like a ‚Äúreal‚Äù KVM switch! üéâ&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ninth Circuit rules NSA&amp;#039;s bulk collection of Americans&amp;#039; call records was illegal</title>
<link>https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/02/court-rules-nsa-phone-snooping-illegal-407727</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/02/court-rules-nsa-phone-snooping-illegal-407727</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Judge Marsha Berzon's opinion, which contains a half-dozen references to the role of former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden in disclosing the NSA metadata program, concludes that the &quot;bulk collection&quot; of such data violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The call-tracking effort began without court authorization under President George W. Bush following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. A similar program was approved by the secretive FISA Court beginning in 2006 and renewed numerous times, but the 9th Circuit panel said those rulings were legally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The appeals court stopped just short of saying that the snooping was definitely unconstitutional, but rejected the Justice Department's arguments that collecting the metadata did not amount to a search under a 40-year-old legal precedent because customers voluntarily share such info with telephone providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;Here the NSA collected Moalin‚Äôs (and millions of other Americans‚Äô) telephony metadata on an ongoing, daily basis for years,&quot; wrote Berzon, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. &quot;Moalin likely had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his telephony metadata ‚Äî at the very least, it is a close question.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Berzon's opinion was jointed by Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, an appointee of President Barack Obama and Judge Jack Zouhary, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The 9th Circuit panel essentially endorsed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/nsa-phone-data-collection-illegal-court-ruling-117725&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a 2015 ruling from the New York-based 2nd Circuit&lt;/a&gt; that found the mass surveillance was not sufficiently tied to any specific investigation, as Congress appeared to require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Berzon said the defendants were entitled to notice that the foreign-intelligence-related surveillance contributed to the case, but not necessarily the details of how. But she said even if Moalin and his co-defendants had clear notice of that, it wouldn't have helped their defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;Based on our careful review of the classified record, we are satisfied that any lack of notice, assuming such notice was required, did not prejudice defendants,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Having carefully reviewed the classified FISA applications and all related classified information, we are convinced that under established Fourth Amendment standards, the metadata collection, even if unconstitutional, did not taint the evidence introduced by the government at trial.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;During the public debate over the program ‚Äî¬†triggered, as the opinion notes in half a dozen places, by disclosures from Snowden ‚Äî¬†numerous officials pointed to the Moalin prosecution as concrete evidence that the program was contributing to U.S. prosecutions for terrorism. Other examples cited by officials were primarily overseas. And the Moalin case was not about any plans for attacks in the U.S., but in Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The new 9th Circuit opinion cites congressional testimony by former FBI official Sean Joyce that the metadata program gave agents a break that led to them reopening the investigation into Moalin. But Berzon goes on to suggest that the public claims by Joyce or others were inaccurate because the metadata program did not play a pivotal role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;&quot;To the extent the public statements of government officials created a contrary impression, that impression is inconsistent with the contents of the classified record,&quot; she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Joyce, who retired from the FBI several years ago, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The metadata program was officially shut down in 2015 after Congress passed the USA FREEDOM Act, which provided a new mechanism where phone providers retained their data instead of turning it over to the government. The revamped system &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/nsa-phone-records-program-shut-down.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appears to have been abandoned&lt;/a&gt; by the NSA in 2018 or 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000174-4f61-de4a-ad7d-ffeff5e80000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the 59-page opinion&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday is another reminder of the exceedingly slow pace of some 9th Circuit appeals, particularly those involving classified information or FISA surveillance. The court took almost seven years to render its legal judgment on Moalin's appeal, filed in November 2013. The case was argued in November 2016, two days after Donald Trump's surprise victory in the presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Moalin, who received an 18-year sentence, and one of his co-defendants remain in prison. The two other co-defendants already completed their sentences and were released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;And the case may not be over yet: Any of the defendants or the government could seek review from a larger, 11-judge en banc court. A Supreme Court petition is also possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre disappointed in the result, especially since more recent disclosures regarding misconduct regarding FISA has further revealed how the lack of transparency in the entire process compromises individual rights of those charged with crimes as well as those never charged ‚Äì including those Americans whose telephone metadata was collected and retained,&quot; said Joshua L. Dratel, a lawyer for Moalin. &quot;In this case, we believe that the lack of transparency was prejudicial to our ability to challenge the FISA surveillance.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision as &quot;a victory for our privacy rights,&quot; though the left-leaning group said it was &quot;disappointed that, having found the surveillance of Mr. Moalin unlawful, the court declined to order suppression of the illegally obtained evidence in his case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Moalin's defense team is now &quot;evaluating the options for further appeal,&quot; the ACLU said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;A Justice Department spokesperson had no immediate comment on the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Another recent 9th Circuit decision involving allegations of illegal surveillance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/28/fbi-mosque-surveillance-suit-1196704&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;took about six years to produce an opinion&lt;/a&gt;, also authored by Berzon. The Justice Department said in a court filing Tuesday that it is still considering whether to seek Supreme Court review in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;History&quot;&gt;History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2020, some individual medieval adaptations of popular music had gained attention on YouTube, such as Algal the Bard's version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_a_Down&quot; title=&quot;System of a Down&quot;&gt;System of a Down&lt;/a&gt;'s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity_(song)&quot; title=&quot;Toxicity (song)&quot;&gt;Toxicity&lt;/a&gt;&quot; which attracted millions of listeners after it was published in December 2017.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-3&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardcore#cite_note-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian&quot; title=&quot;The Guardian&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; dates the origin of bardcore as a distinct trend to 20 April 2020, during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns&quot; title=&quot;COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns&quot;&gt;COVID-19 pandemic lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, when 27-year-old German &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber&quot; title=&quot;YouTuber&quot;&gt;YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; Cornelius Link released &quot;Astronomia (Medieval Style)&quot;.

<title>Half of Americans fear a health-related bankruptcy</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/health-bankruptcy-fears-poll-ce3c4905-53c6-4f43-ba4f-fde22f4ef849.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/health-bankruptcy-fears-poll-ce3c4905-53c6-4f43-ba4f-fde22f4ef849.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The number of Americans who worry about bankruptcy if they have a serious health issue has spiked over the last year and a half ‚Äî particularly among men, people of color and young adults, according to a &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;new survey&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/317948/fear-bankruptcy-due-major-health-event.aspx&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;ce3c4905-53c6-4f43-ba4f-fde22f4ef849&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Half of Americans fear a health-related bankruptcy&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/317948/fear-bankruptcy-due-major-health-event.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new survey&lt;/a&gt; from West Health and Gallup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Health care costs were a huge issue even when the economy was good and we weren't in a global pandemic. Now, millions of people have gotten sick, lost their jobs, lost their health insurance, or all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; 15% of adults said that at least one person in their household has medical debt that they won't be able to repay within the next year, including 20% of adults of color and 12% of white adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unsurprisingly, a much larger percentage of lower-income households say the same, compared to higher-income households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quarter of adults say that they'd have to borrow money to pay a $500 medical bill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; The pandemic is making all of our existing health care problems worse.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Today the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2020/09/01/tsa-continues-piloting-self-service-checkpoint-technology&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has launched a ‚Äúpilot‚Äù at Washington National Airport (DCA) of yet another scheme for biometric identification and tracking of domestic air travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15214&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-ID-station-1SEP2020.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-15214&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-15214 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-ID-station-1SEP2020-1024x855.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;802&quot; srcset=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-ID-station-1SEP2020-1024x855.png 1024w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-ID-station-1SEP2020-300x251.png 300w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-ID-station-1SEP2020-768x642.png 768w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-ID-station-1SEP2020.png 1124w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-15214&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;[Screen capture from TSA video]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The new ‚Äútouchless ID verification‚Äù stations at DCA include a webcam (at top center of photo above) a magnetic-stripe reader (lower left) for drivers licenses and other ID cards, and a photographic scanner for passports (lower right).
&lt;p&gt;Travelers who volunteer to use the new system are directed to insert their drivers license, ID card, or passport into the appropriate reader, stand on a marked spot in front of the webcam, and remove their face mask, so that the image from the ID (or, more likely, from some back-end image database linked to the ID, although that hasn‚Äôt been disclosed) and the image from the webcam can be compared by some undisclosed algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15215&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-mask-down-1SEP2020.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-15215&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-15215 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-mask-down-1SEP2020-1024x586.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;549&quot; srcset=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-mask-down-1SEP2020-1024x586.png 1024w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-mask-down-1SEP2020-300x172.png 300w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-mask-down-1SEP2020-768x440.png 768w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-mask-down-1SEP2020-1536x879.png 1536w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-mask-down-1SEP2020.png 1654w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-15215&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;[Traveler being directed by TSA staff to remove her face mask for digital mug shot.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
As we‚Äôve &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2020/06/08/tsa-to-take-mug-shots-of-domestic-air-travelers/#comment-3574618&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; previously, it appears to us that (1) the TSA has no general authority to require travelers to show their faces or remove face masks, and (2) in &lt;a href=&quot;http://d31hzlhk6di2h5.cloudfront.net/20200708/e6/20/9a/65/56092a34e041b87d4e2b46c7/EO-163.pdf&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf&quot;&gt;jurisdictions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mass.gov/doc/may-1-2020-masks-and-face-coverings/download&quot;&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt; issued by state or local health authorities currently &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; all people in public places such as airports to wear masks.
&lt;p&gt;The TSA describes this system as ‚Äútouchless‚Äù. But while TSA staff don‚Äôt have to touch travelers‚Äô IDs, each traveler has to touch the same ID card or passport scanner. Then, immediately after touching the scanner, they have to touch their face again to put their mask back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TSA press release (reproduced in full below, since it doesn‚Äôt seem to be available on the TSA‚Äôs website) doesn‚Äôt say how long this ‚Äúpilot‚Äù will last. In practice, expansions of TSA tracking of travelers have typically been rolled out incrementally, initially announced with reassuring statements that ‚Äúthis is only a test‚Äù and is ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù, but then continued indefinitely and made compulsory as a condition of passage through TSA checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TSA signs at the new ID verification stations says that mug shots are voluntary, but that ‚ÄúYou &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; still insert or scan your identity document in the device, even if you do not have your photo taken.‚Äù No legal basis for this purported requirement is specified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_15216&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-sign-1SEP2020.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-15216&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-15216 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-sign-1SEP2020-1024x572.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; srcset=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-sign-1SEP2020-1024x572.png 1024w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-sign-1SEP2020-300x167.png 300w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-sign-1SEP2020-768x429.png 768w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-sign-1SEP2020-1536x858.png 1536w, https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DCA-sign-1SEP2020.png 1587w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-15216&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;[Sign at TSA ‚Äútouchless ID verification‚Äù station]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The TSA signs (visible in full on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/453662877/50fb78a8ed&quot;&gt;this TSA video&lt;/a&gt; released in conjunction with today‚Äôs press release) include ‚Äî typically for the TSA and DHS ‚Äî no OMB Control Number or Paperwork Reduction Act notice, both of which are required for any collection of information by a Federal agency, &lt;em&gt;regardless of whether the collection of information is optional or mandatory, and regardless of whether the information collected is retained&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;As with the TSA‚Äôs illegal ‚ÄúID verification form‚Äù (&lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2013/05/29/tsa-never-got-omb-approval-for-certificate-of-id-form-415/&quot;&gt;Form 415&lt;/a&gt;), we believe that in the absence of OMB arpproval, assignment of an OMB Control Number, and a valid PRA notice including that OMB Control Number, the PRA provides an absolute defense against any sanctions for declining to have data from an ID card or passport collected by the TSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn‚Äôt be difficult for the DHS to comply with the requirements for OMB approval and PRA notices, and the failure to comply with these limited procedural¬† rules isn‚Äôt &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/the-issue/&quot;&gt;what‚Äôs fundamentaly wrong with requiring travelers to identity themseves&lt;/a&gt;.¬† But the DHS‚Äôs cavalier disregard for the PRA is indicative of its general disregard for even more significant laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know what happens if you decline to have your ID card or passport scanned (on the basis of the PRA) or to remove your face mask (on the basis of local health orders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card readers and scanners show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idemia.com/news/idemias-response-support-air-travel-recovery-2020-08-24&quot;&gt;Idemia&lt;/a&gt; labels, but it‚Äôs unclear whether Idemia has also provided the image-comparison software or database connectivity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is the full text of today‚Äôs TSA press release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRESS RELEASE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 1, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSA continues piloting ‚Äúself-service‚Äù checkpoint technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effort promotes social distancing, reduces contact between officers and passengers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON ‚Äì The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is piloting a new touchless ‚Äúself-service‚Äù technology that matches a traveler‚Äôs live photo with the photo on their ID. The initiative automatically authenticates a traveler‚Äôs ID, matches the live photo with the image on their ID, and confirms their flight information in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn light of COVID-19, advanced health and safety precautions have become a top priority and part of the new normal for TSA,‚Äù said TSA Administrator David Pekoske. ‚ÄúAs a result, we are exploring rapid testing and deployment of this touchless, self-service technology. At the conclusion of the pilot, we expect to be able to determine how positioning the new technology will allow passengers to use it themselves thereby providing a safer checkpoint experience, while adding significant security benefits.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current pilot at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) follows a previous 30-day test of the credential authentication technology with a camera in September 2019 at McCarran International Airport with volunteer TSA PreCheck‚Ñ¢ passengers. Following that pilot, TSA refined the technology in partnership with the vendor and industry experts. The pilot at DCA also includes volunteer TSA PreCheck travelers, who generally have the shortest wait times and the least amount of physical contact while at a TSA checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelers at DCA are now able to voluntarily participate in the pilot. Passengers will be able to approach the device and insert their own ID into the scanner for authentication, rather than physically handing it to a TSA officer, thus promoting social distancing and reducing physical contact. The device will also verify the identity of passengers by taking a photo of the traveler and comparing it with the image on their ID. The device will display results for face matching, ID authentication, and flight information to the TSA officer, who will be behind an acrylic shield to further minimize contact between the officer and passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credential authentication technology units authenticate several thousand types of IDs including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;U.S. driver‚Äôs licenses and photo IDs issued by state motor vehicle departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. passports/Permanent resident cards or visas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. military common access cards/Retired and Uniformed service military ID cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department of Homeland Security Trusted Traveler ID cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs of travelers taken as part of the program are not saved, as there is no capacity to do so. The photographs are only used for identity verification to confirm that the photo matches the image on the traveler‚Äôs ID and ensure the passenger is the true bearer of an authentic ID. Signs near the checkpoint will provide notice to passengers on how to participate in the pilot, in addition to providing instructions on how to decline having their photo taken, although passenger IDs will still have to be scanned through the device for identity verification. Participating travelers may complete a brief survey via a QR code regarding their experience and satisfaction with the self-service system and its usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For broadcast content, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/453662877/50fb78a8ed&quot;&gt;TSA courtesy B-roll&lt;/a&gt; of the new machines in use at DCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-14iz86j-BoldText e5tfeyi0&quot;&gt;There is &quot;unequivocal proof&quot; that Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, Germany has said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Angela Merkel said he was a victim of attempted murder and the world would look to Russia for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin after falling ill on a flight in Siberia last month, and remains in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His team says he was poisoned on President Vladimir Putin's orders. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin spokesman called on Germany for a full exchange of information and foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained the Novichok allegations were not backed up by evidence. &quot;Where are the facts, where are the formulas, at least some kind of information?&quot; she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Novichok nerve agent was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK in 2018. While they survived, a British woman later died in hospital. The UK accused Russia's military intelligence of carrying out that attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;24.035555555556&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1jlqpzd-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10&quot;&gt;What has Germany said?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the government in Berlin released results of toxicology tests carried out at a military laboratory, Chancellor Merkel said there were now &quot;serious questions that only the Russian government can and must answer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Someone tried to silence [Mr Navalny] and in the name of the whole German government I condemn that in the strongest terms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chancellor Merkel said Germany's Nato and EU partners had been informed of the results of the investigation and they would decide on a common and appropriate response based on Russia's reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya and Russia's ambassador to Germany would also be informed of the findings, the Berlin government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;28.675324675325&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-83cqas-RichTextContainer e5tfeyi2&quot; readability=&quot;30.467532467532&quot;&gt;The European Union has demanded a &quot;transparent&quot; investigation by the Russian government. &quot;Those responsible must be brought to justice,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/84677/russia-statement-high-representativevice-president-josep-borrell-poisoning-alexei-navalny_en&quot; class=&quot;css-yidnqd-InlineLink e1no5rhv0&quot;&gt;a statement read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexei Navalny is a name President Putin refuses to say out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an attempt to diminish his political significance, but the endless prosecutions, police detentions and giant fines Mr Navalny's faced over the years tell a different story about his impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's certainly annoyed a lot of people, from those targeted by his anti-corruption investigations to Vladimir Putin himself. So it is possible someone wanted to resolve the &quot;Navalny problem&quot; for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing is largely irrelevant. Why now? Well, why not. But if whoever did this hoped to contain the fallout - a mysterious collapse, never explained by Russian doctors - the fact Navalny's team got him to Germany has blown that calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;collapse&quot; is now a deliberate attack, and a major international scandal. The Kremlin response so far is familiar: deny, obfuscate, demand proof. Mr Putin's spokesman has even hinted that if Mr Navalny had been poisoned, then it must have happened in Germany because doctors here detected nothing suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect to hear a lot more along those lines in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1jlqpzd-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10&quot;&gt;What happened to Navalny?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Navalny fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea at Tomsk airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight of the prominent Putin critic was diverted to Omsk, where doctors treated him for three days before he was transferred to the Charit√© hospital in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-178wc68-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0&quot;&gt;image caption&lt;/span&gt;Mr Navalny's transfer to Germany came after three days in hospital in Omsk&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin says Russian doctors administered atropine - which can be used to treat the effects of nerve agents - but found no evidence of poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs Navalnaya said she feared Russian doctors had delayed his transfer as authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors at Charit√© hospital have said his condition is continuing to improve but he remains in an intensive care unit on a ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1jlqpzd-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10&quot;&gt;What is Novichok?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name Novichok means &quot;newcomer&quot; in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;media-block&quot; class=&quot;css-r83t2i-ComponentWrapper e1xue1i80&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-178wc68-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0&quot;&gt;media caption&lt;/span&gt;Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents - they act by blocking messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some Novichok agents are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. This means they can be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions begin to take effect rapidly - in the order of 30 seconds to two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were left critically ill in the British city of Salisbury, after Russian suspects were alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on the door handle of the former Russian spy's home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. Her partner became critically ill but recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1jlqpzd-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10&quot;&gt;Who is Navalny?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner who has led nationwide protests against the Russian authorities. He has called Mr Putin's party a place of &quot;crooks and thieves&quot; that is &quot;sucking the blood out of Russia&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he has been banned from standing against Mr Putin in elections because of a conviction for embezzlement. He denies the crime, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of previous attacks on high-profile critics or opponents of President Putin, including politicians, intelligence officers and journalists. The Kremlin has always denied involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1jlqpzd-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10&quot;&gt;Who else has been poisoned?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko - an ex-Russian intelligence officer who became a Kremlin critic and fled to the UK - died after his tea was poisoned by radioactive polonium-210.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, journalist and opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza alleged he was poisoned twice by Russian security services. He nearly died after suffering kidney failure in 2015 and two years later went into a coma for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Kremlin critic, Pyotr Verzilov, accused Russia's intelligence services of poisoning him in 2018, when he fell ill after a court hearing, losing his sight and ability to speak. He too was treated by Berlin's Charit√© hospital, and asked the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace Foundation to arrange Mr Navalny's airlift there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-178wc68-VisuallyHidden e1y6uwnp0&quot;&gt;image caption&lt;/span&gt;PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is one of the most popular battle royale video games and a rival to Fortnite&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;css-14iz86j-BoldText e5tfeyi0&quot;&gt;A further 118 Chinese mobile apps have been banned by the Indian government, as tensions between the two countries continue to rise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those on the list include several of Tencent's products including the hit video game PUBG Mobile and WeChat Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously the government had banned 59 of the most popular apps including TikTok over national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India's IT Ministry said it had &quot;credible information&quot; the latest batch were acting against India's interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other apps affected include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;unordered-list-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Netease games including Marvel Super War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sina News&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said it had received many complaints from &quot;various sources&quot; including several reports about &quot;misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The compilation of this data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ban comes against the backdrop of tensions along a disputed Himalayan border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both India and China deployed more troops to the Ladakh region in June and clashes have left at least 20 Indian troops dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite images appear to show that China has built new structures overlooking the Himalayan border region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-component=&quot;text-block&quot; class=&quot;css-uf6wea-RichTextComponentWrapper e1xue1i82&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US has also recently taken action against Chinese apps, threatening to ban TikTok and ordering US firms to stop doing business with Tencent's WeChat platform. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has said that the administration also has other Chinese apps within its sights.&lt;/p&gt;

It also suggests 10-plus potential treatments, many of which are already FDA approved. Jacobson‚Äôs group &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;published their results&lt;/a&gt; in a paper in the journal &lt;em class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; in early July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b66e&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;According to the team‚Äôs findings, a Covid-19 infection generally begins when the virus enters the body through ACE2 receptors in the nose, (The receptors, which the virus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/meet-ace2-the-enzyme-at-the-center-of-the-covid-19-mystery/&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;is known to target&lt;/a&gt;, are abundant there.) The virus then proceeds through the body, entering cells in other places where ACE2 is also present: the intestines, kidneys, and heart. This likely accounts for at least some of the disease‚Äôs cardiac and GI symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4dd7&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;But once Covid-19 has established itself in the body, things start to get really interesting. According to Jacobson‚Äôs group, the data Summit analyzed shows that Covid-19 isn‚Äôt content to simply infect cells that already express lots of ACE2 receptors. Instead, it actively hijacks the body‚Äôs own systems, tricking it into upregulating ACE2 receptors in places where they‚Äôre usually expressed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186534/&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;low or medium levels&lt;/a&gt;, including the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5e64&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;In this sense, Covid-19 is like a burglar who slips in your unlocked second-floor window and starts to ransack your house. Once inside, though, they don‚Äôt just take your stuff ‚Äî they also throw open all your doors and windows so their accomplices can rush in and help pillage more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5672&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;The renin‚Äìangiotensin system (RAS) controls many aspects of the circulatory system, including the body‚Äôs levels of a chemical called bradykinin, which normally helps to regulate blood pressure. According to the team‚Äôs analysis, when the virus tweaks the RAS, it causes the body‚Äôs mechanisms for regulating bradykinin to go haywire. Bradykinin receptors are resensitized, and the body also stops effectively breaking down bradykinin. (ACE normally degrades bradykinin, but when the virus downregulates it, it can‚Äôt do this as effectively.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bd8d&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;The end result, the researchers say, is to release a bradykinin storm ‚Äî a massive, runaway buildup of bradykinin in the body. According to the bradykinin hypothesis, it‚Äôs this storm that is ultimately responsible for many of Covid-19‚Äôs deadly effects. Jacobson‚Äôs team says in their paper that ‚Äúthe pathology of Covid-19 is likely the result of Bradykinin Storms rather than cytokine storms,‚Äù which &lt;a class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/this-is-how-your-immune-system-reacts-to-coronavirus-cbf5271e530e&quot;&gt;had been previously identified&lt;/a&gt; in Covid-19 patients, but that ‚Äúthe two may be intricately linked.‚Äù &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7267506/&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Other papers&lt;/a&gt; had previously identified bradykinin storms as a possible cause of Covid-19‚Äôs pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;76f2&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd lm iy iz gg ln jb jc jd lo gl jf jg lp go ji jj lq gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;As bradykinin builds up in the body, it dramatically increases vascular permeability. In short, it makes your blood vessels leaky.

But Covid-19 still has a massive effect on the lungs. As blood vessels start to leak due to a bradykinin storm, the researchers say, the lungs can fill with fluid. Immune cells also leak out into the lungs, Jacobson‚Äôs team found, causing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;bbcf&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;The bradykinin hypothesis also extends to many of Covid-19‚Äôs effects on the heart.

Some of this is likely due to the virus infecting the heart directly through its ACE2 receptors. But the RAS also controls aspects of cardiac contractions and blood pressure. According to the researchers, bradykinin storms could create arrhythmias and low blood pressure, which are often seen in Covid-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;9545&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;If bradykinin storms cause the blood-brain barrier to break down, this could allow harmful cells and compounds into the brain, leading to inflammation, potential brain damage, and many of the neurological symptoms Covid-19 patients experience. Jacobson told me, ‚ÄúIt is a reasonable hypothesis that many of the neurological symptoms in Covid-19 could be due to an excess of bradykinin. It has been reported that bradykinin would indeed be likely to increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. In addition, similar neurological symptoms have been observed in other diseases that result from an excess of bradykinin.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

ACE inhibitors are known to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/ace-inhibitors/art-20047480&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; a dry cough and fatigue, two textbook symptoms of Covid-19. And they can potentially increase blood potassium levels, which has also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/beingwell/in-some-patients-with-covid-19-the-blood-potassium-levels-are-high-f1ef9f65e9cf&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;observed in Covid-19 patients&lt;/a&gt;. The similarities between ACE inhibitor side effects and Covid-19 symptoms strengthen the bradykinin hypothesis, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;92df&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;ACE inhibitors are also known to cause a &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.medium.com/a-new-study-explains-why-covid-19-causes-a-loss-of-smell-e3f9e7082bdd&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;loss of taste and smell&lt;/a&gt;. Jacobson stresses, though, that this symptom is more likely due to the virus ‚Äúaffecting the cells surrounding olfactory nerve cells‚Äù than the direct effects of bradykinin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4d2c&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;Though still an emerging theory, the bradykinin hypothesis explains several other of Covid-19‚Äôs seemingly bizarre symptoms. Jacobson and his team speculate that leaky vasculature caused by bradykinin storms could be responsible for ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-covid-toe.html&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;Covid toes&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù a condition involving swollen, bruised toes that some Covid-19 patients experience. Bradykinin can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1665827/&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;mess with the thyroid&lt;/a&gt; gland, which could produce the &lt;a class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/the-coronavirus-may-mess-with-thyroid-levels-too-87f94e45c5c9&quot;&gt;thyroid symptoms&lt;/a&gt; recently observed in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;60ca&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;The bradykinin hypothesis could also explain some of the broader demographic patterns of the disease‚Äôs spread. The researchers note that some aspects of the RAS system are sex-linked, with proteins for several receptors (such as one called TMSB4X) located on the X chromosome. This means that ‚Äúwomen‚Ä¶ would have twice the levels of this protein than men,‚Äù a result borne out by the researchers‚Äô data. In their paper, Jacobson‚Äôs team concludes that this ‚Äúcould explain the lower incidence of Covid-19 induced mortality in women.‚Äù A genetic quirk of the RAS could be giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.medium.com/why-do-men-fare-worse-with-covid-19-a5debff87dc1&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;women extra protection against the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f600&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;The bradykinin hypothesis provides a model that ‚Äúcontributes to a better understanding of Covid-19‚Äù and ‚Äúadds novelty to the existing literature,‚Äù according to scientists Frank van de Veerdonk, Jos WM van der Meer, and Roger Little, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/articles/59177&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;peer-reviewed the team‚Äôs paper&lt;/a&gt;. It predicts nearly all the disease‚Äôs symptoms, even ones (like bruises on the toes) that at first appear random, and further suggests new treatments for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e2ea&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;As Jacobson and team point out, several drugs target aspects of the RAS and are already FDA approved to treat other conditions. They could arguably be applied to treating Covid-19 as well. Several, like danazol, stanozolol, and ecallantide, reduce bradykinin production and could potentially stop a deadly bradykinin storm. Others, like icatibant, reduce bradykinin signaling and could blunt its effects once it‚Äôs already in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;917b&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;Interestingly, Jacobson‚Äôs team also suggests &lt;a class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/what-black-people-need-to-know-about-vitamin-d-and-covid-19-5bf5885d5288&quot;&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; as a potentially useful Covid-19 drug. The vitamin is involved in the RAS system and could prove helpful by reducing levels of another compound, known as REN. Again, this could stop potentially deadly bradykinin storms from forming. The researchers note that vitamin D has already &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3571484&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;been shown to help those with Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;. The vitamin is readily available over the counter, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126987/#:~:text=vitamin%20D%20deficiency-,The%20prevalence%20of%20mild%2C%20moderate%20and%20severe%20vitamin%20D%20deficiencies,%25%2C%20and%2026.9%25%20respectively.&quot; class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot;&gt;around 20% of the population is deficient&lt;/a&gt;. If indeed the vitamin proves effective at reducing the severity of bradykinin storms, it could be an easy, relatively safe way to reduce the severity of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;41f9&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;Other compounds could treat symptoms associated with bradykinin storms. Hymecromone, for example, could reduce hyaluronic acid levels, potentially stopping deadly hydrogels from forming in the lungs. And timbetasin could mimic the mechanism that the researchers believe protects women from more severe Covid-19 infections. All of these potential treatments are speculative, of course, and would need to be studied in a rigorous, controlled environment before their effectiveness could be determined and they could be used more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cbb5&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;Covid-19 stands out for both the scale of its global impact and the apparent randomness of &lt;a class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/every-covid-19-symptom-we-know-about-right-now-from-head-to-toe-bd1d47584096&quot;&gt;its many symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;av jx jy jz ka kb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://elemental.medium.com/9-things-experts-know-about-covid-19-that-they-didnt-know-then-5f22819807c4&quot;&gt;Physicians have struggled to understand the disease&lt;/a&gt; and come up with a unified theory for how it works. Though as of yet unproven, the bradykinin hypothesis provides such a theory. And like all good hypotheses, it also provides specific, testable predictions ‚Äî in this case, actual drugs that could provide relief to real patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;be6d&quot; class=&quot;iu iv fk iw b gd ix iy iz gg ja jb jc jd je gl jf jg jh go ji jj jk gr jl jm fc df&quot;&gt;The researchers are quick to point out that ‚Äúthe testing of any of these pharmaceutical interventions should be done in well-designed clinical trials.‚Äù As to the next step in the process, Jacobson is clear: ‚ÄúWe have to get this message out.‚Äù His team‚Äôs finding won‚Äôt cure Covid-19. But if the treatments it points to pan out in the clinic, interventions guided by the bradykinin hypothesis could greatly reduce patients‚Äô suffering ‚Äî and potentially save lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearing witness to the historic reckoning with systemic racism, and amplifying dialogue to drive change that delivers on the promise of racial equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Mike, a white man in his 50s, was in a bad spot: He was stuck idling in traffic on New York City‚Äôs Riverside Drive, running late for a meeting, and he needed to get to the Upper East Side pronto. Hopping on the shoulder to bypass the other cars wasn‚Äôt the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; thing to do, he told VICE, but he‚Äôd seen other people get away with it before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Mike, whose name has been changed to protect his privacy, said he knew it was risky‚Äîespecially because the borrowed car he was driving didn‚Äôt have a license plate, let alone a registration under his name. He decided to roll the dice anyway. Right away, bad news: a traffic checkpoint, and cops pulling people over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;100.82483370288&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThat was probably the tightest spot I could've been in,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúBecause [the offense] could've been ‚Äòdriving without a plate,‚Äô ‚Äòdriving with no registration...‚Äô&quot; By driving on the shoulder, too, Mike was driving illegally in at least three different ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Despite that, he felt confident as the cop approached his car and told him to roll down his window. Instead of pulling out his driver‚Äôs license, Mike simply introduced himself and produced something better. ‚ÄúI just basically happened to have one of their PBA cards on me,‚Äù he said, referring to the small, plastic &quot;courtesy&quot; cards issued by the Police Benevolent Association, which usually have an officer‚Äôs name, phone number, and signature on the back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The cards are designed to be presented in a low-stakes police encounter, like a traffic stop, as a laminated wink-and-nudge between officers that says, ‚ÄúHey, would you mind going a little easy on this one?‚Äù When a cop is handed a PBA card, they can call the number on it to verify the relationship between the cardholder and the issuer, then decide whether it means they should give the cardholder a break.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;According to Mike, the officer looked at the card, then let him go without asking for ID or the car‚Äôs registration. &quot;By knowing somebody and having that connection, it worked,‚Äù Mike said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The somebody Mike knew was a U.S. Route 1 patrolman, a colleague of the cops who‚Äôd pulled him over. Though he didn‚Äôt have a license plate &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; registration, he did have proof of that ‚Äúconnection,‚Äù and it was all he needed to be on his way without any trouble. As he did on that day in 1993, Mike has continued to carry, use, and benefit from PBA cards for almost three decades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-component=&quot;QuoteBlock&quot; class=&quot;abc__quote abc__quote--blockquote&quot; readability=&quot;9.1705069124424&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you a PBA cardholder, or a cop with opinions on discretion?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have information you would like to share, you can reach the reporter directly at&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;¬†&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:katie.way@vice.com&quot;&gt;katie.way@vice.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, or securely via Signal at +1 (571) 205-0611.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Though Mike‚Äôs story may seem like it comes from a less-scrutinized, outdated era of law enforcement, PBA cards are still used and accepted in the present, without much oversight. They serve as a physical example of how cops are able to exercise the law largely as they feel, personally, is right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;With a few exceptions, PBA cards aren‚Äôt a normal part of life for most people in the U.S. Though they do confer some privilege and exclusivity, the cards aren't exactly a secret. The Police Benevolent Association, New York City‚Äôs largest police union, issues these courtesy cards‚Äînicknamed &quot;get out of jail free cards&quot;‚Äîto its members on a yearly basis. Members can pass the cards out to whomever they choose to provide them with a little extra protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;61.721483554934&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Mike works in an industry that regularly puts him into contact with police officers, which gives him the opportunity to form personal, trusting relationships with them. As such, he said, he frequently receives PBA cards as a thank-you for extending cops small business favors and deals; currently, he estimates that he has somewhere between 10 and 12 unexpired courtesy cards in his possession. They're ideal for slipping into a wallet alongside other forms of identification. (Driver‚Äôs license? Check. Work ID? Check. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm friends with a cop‚Äù card? Check.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Other New York City police unions, like the Detectives‚Äô Endowment Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association, do the same with their own courtesy cards; elsewhere, police unions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/local/20100607_Police_say_don_t_confuse_courtesy_cards_with_a_free_pass.html&quot;&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metnews.com/articles/2015/perspectives102715.htm&quot;&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20070706/news/707060352&quot;&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; have a history of issuing courtesy cards of their own. (The Detectives‚Äô Endowment Association and Sergeants Benevolent Association did not respond to requests for comment. The NYC PBA declined to comment for this story.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;According to John Driscoll, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, PBA cards aren‚Äôt &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; carte blanche to flout the law. Driscoll, a former NYPD officer himself, told VICE that, in his experience, the cards are most likely to work in one‚Äôs favor during traffic stops for minor infractions, like speeding or a busted tail light‚Äîand not in more serious cases, like drunk driving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;When a PBA card is presented, it's up to the officer how they want to factor it into a stop. ‚ÄúSome officers, I think they'd summons their own mother,‚Äù Driscoll said. ‚ÄúThe card doesn't mean anything to them. Other people [are less that way]; we have wide discretion when it comes to issuing summonses, so officers exercise that all the time,‚Äù he said, in order to let PBA cardholders off the hook for minor infractions if they so choose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;It may seem inconsequential when that choice means a police officer‚Äôs 19-year-old nephew walks away with a warning for running a stop sign in his suburban neighborhood. But because cops can also use discretion to over-apply the law violently to vulnerable populations, PBA cards and the privileges they confer are darkly emblematic of how certain people are favored in situations in which others are endangered or hurt by police.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The existence of these cards is a concrete example of a larger, often more insidious problem in American policing: Discretionary decision-making allows police to pick and choose who the law &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; applies to‚Äîand who gets a pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-component=&quot;QuoteBlock&quot; class=&quot;abc__quote abc__quote--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúUsually when we think about discretion, we think about what cops &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do. But on the street, it's also who they won't harass, who they won't arrest, who they choose to let off.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;There are countless cases, many well-documented, of police brutality that have begun with a cop pulling a Black or nonwhite driver over for the type of very routine traffic stop that PBA cards are designed to smooth over. The ‚Äúbroken taillight‚Äù infraction has become a trope when it comes to police violence, specifically against Black people: In 2016, a Minneapolis police officer &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/725618/another-black-man-was-fatally-shot-at-a-traffic-stop-in-the-us-his-girlfriend-broadcast-the-aftermath-on-facebook-live/&quot;&gt;killed Philando Castile&lt;/a&gt; after pulling him over for a broken taillight; Castile was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/15/485835272/the-driving-life-and-death-of-philando-castile&quot;&gt;reportedly pulled over for similar infractions on a regular basis&lt;/a&gt;. (The officer in question was later acquitted.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Black Americans have filed lawsuits against police officers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/16/aurora-police-lawsuit-black-couple-frisked/&quot;&gt;Aurora, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/legal_features/case_filings_tucker_v._city_of_shreveport&quot;&gt;Shreveport, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, alleging discriminatory and violent treatment during broken taillight stops, fortunately without deadly consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;59.364801078894&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/sandra-bland-video-brian-encinia.html&quot;&gt;Sandra Bland&lt;/a&gt; was pulled over in Prairie View, Texas, for failing to signal while changing lanes; after a state trooper threatened her with a stun gun, Bland was taken into custody, where she was found dead three days later. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/14/revealed-phoenix-womans-brutal-police-assault-shown-on-body-camera-footage&quot;&gt;many other accounts&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2019/07/11/siblings-say-nypd-officers-went-too-far-during-traffic-stop#&quot;&gt;police choosing violence&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://knx1070.radio.com/articles/redlands-pd-drags-black-man-out-of-car-for-broken-taillight&quot;&gt;people they pull over&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://knx1070.radio.com/articles/redlands-pd-drags-black-man-out-of-car-for-broken-taillight&quot;&gt;minor traffic infractions&lt;/a&gt;, particularly if they aren't white.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;To illustrate how discretion permeates issues of policing large and small, David Correia, an associate professor at the University of Mexico and co-author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.versobooks.com/books/2530-police&quot;&gt;Police: A Field Guide&lt;/a&gt;, also pointed to over-policing in the ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-25/beyond-broken-windows-what-really-drives-urban-crime&quot;&gt;crime-infested&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù neighborhoods overwhelmingly populated by Black and brown people living at or below the poverty line; and the proven inability of so-called ‚Äúchokehold bans‚Äù to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/06/16/877527974/how-decades-of-bans-on-police-chokeholds-have-fallen-short&quot;&gt;curb the police use of chokeholds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;While injustices like these have gradually begun to receive the attention they need, the way that cops apply discretion in the other direction‚Äîin the form of favoritism toward people who are friendly to police‚Äîis a matter that they and their PBA-card-holding associates work to keep quiet, especially as it contrasts starkly with the gross mistreatment that people of color receive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúUsually when we think about discretion, we think about what cops can do, what law permits them to do, what law constrains them from doing,‚Äù Correia said. ‚ÄúBut on the street, it's also who they won't harass, who they won't arrest, who they choose to let off.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;66.019826517968&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In separate interviews with VICE, Correia and Tyler Wall, the other co-author of &lt;em&gt;Police: A Field Guide&lt;/em&gt;, both emphasized the fact that these cards typify the concept of police discretion. ‚ÄúIt does show a certain level of built-in, ingrained logic of the police,‚Äù Wall said: ‚ÄúThere are people who should be able to perform their love for the cop in order to get out of a ticket.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In practice, Correia and Wall said those who are able to ‚Äúget off easy‚Äù from an encounter with the police typically look and act a lot like Mike, an affable white person who respects police authority and is careful to address them with friendly deference‚Äîto act the part of the sheepish, apologetic innocent who understands that the cop is ‚Äújust doing their job.‚Äù (And, given the publicly available data on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/year-end-2019-enforcement-report.pdf&quot;&gt;demographics of the NYPD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nj.gov/oag/diversity-inclusion/download/2017-Diversity-and-Inclusion-Annual-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;New Jersey state police&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of police issuing cards are likely white officers.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThe best way to use a PBA card is to not have to use it,‚Äù Jack, a white man in his 30s, told VICE. Like Mike, Jack works in an industry that brings him in frequent, close contact with police officers, who occasionally give him PBA cards for a job well done. But Jack also counts cops among his friends and family, and he said those relationships have instilled him with an extra sense of responsibility as a PBA card carrier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Jack last used a PBA card in 2019, when he was pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike in the early hours of the morning. ‚ÄúI &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; speeding,‚Äù Jack said. ‚ÄúI was doing close to 90 miles an hour. I was probably a good 15 to 20 miles over the speed limit.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;63&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;When Jack was pulled over‚Äîon his way to work, with his father, a co-worker, in the passenger seat‚Äîhe felt a thrill of nervousness as the cop approached his window. Jack said he‚Äôs only used a PBA card three times total, and has never felt truly comfortable doing so, because he feels cautious, almost reverent, about the statement he‚Äôs making when he displays one. ‚ÄúWhenever I hand that card over to the police officer, I‚Äôm showing the type of person I am, and it‚Äôs reflecting off whoever gave me that card,‚Äù he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The exchange was brief and friendly. The traffic cop knew the cop whose PBA card Jack handed over, so after a quick phone call to confirm Jack obtained the card legitimately, the traffic cop let Jack go after issuing him a written warning. ‚ÄúHe was still doing his job,‚Äù Jack said. ‚ÄúBut he did let me off from getting a ticket. I have a feeling he gave me the warning because I had the card.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Jack said he didn‚Äôt think it would be right to use a PBA card to extract himself from a more serious situation, like a bar fight or reckless driving‚Äîhe wouldn‚Äôt want the cop who gave him a PBA card to be implicated in his bad behavior, and he also wouldn‚Äôt want to pressure a cop attempting to ticket him into bending the rules, just because he had a privileged relationship with another law enforcement officer. But, at the same time, Jack knows what he‚Äôs signaling when he shows a cop his PBA card.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;59.861333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúIn my opinion, it‚Äôs basically something you hand over to the police officer to show that hey, I'm close with this cop. He gave it to me. He wouldn't have given it to me if he didn't trust me,‚Äù Jack said. ‚ÄúHere it is, you know, you do what you do with it.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Officer discretion is at the core of modern policing‚Äîit vests cops with the power to choose if, when, how, to whom, and to what extent they will apply the law. The school resource officers who &lt;a href=&quot;https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&amp;amp;context=ulr&quot;&gt;handcuff disabled children&lt;/a&gt; for acting out in class are free to do so because they‚Äôve determined, using discretion, that it is necessary. The cop who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-07-28-9103230622-story.html&quot;&gt;returned a scared, naked teenager to Jeffrey Dahmer&lt;/a&gt; after the 14-year-old boy escaped the murderer‚Äôs house? Also exercising discretion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Literature on discretion that‚Äôs favorable to the police effectively states that this decision-making power can‚Äôt be limited, because to do so would curb their ability to react in the moment and enforce the law. According to the preface of criminologist George L. Kelling‚Äôs 1999 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/178259.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; for the Department of Justice on discretion and police training (guided by the still-influential ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/&quot;&gt;broken windows&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù police theory he helped ideate):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe now understand that telling officers only what they cannot do, which is so typical of police manuals and rules and regulations, has not improved the quality of policing. We know as well that the work world of police is too complex to tell officers exactly what they should do in every circumstance.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;63.768582755203&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Kelling goes on to advocate for training that teaches cops about how to think, rather than how to act, in the field‚Äîhow to identify disorder and criminal potential, without placing firm limits on how to act once a supposed threat is identified. This mindset has unsurprisingly been linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/revisiting-broken-windows-theory&quot;&gt;racial profiling&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebpsociety.org/blog/education/403-on-the-criminalization-of-homelessness&quot;&gt;criminalization of unhoused populations&lt;/a&gt;, something Kelling himself expressed concerns about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Though Kelling‚Äôs work was published more than two decades ago, the concepts he helped popularize are still widely considered to be influential in modern policing. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-new-york-city-reduced-mass-incarceration-model-change&quot;&gt;2013 report&lt;/a&gt; from the Brennan Center for Justice drew a direct line between ‚Äúbroken windows‚Äù policing and NYPD‚Äôs ‚Äústop and frisk‚Äù campaign, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/ending-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-did-not-increase-crime&quot;&gt;ended in 2014&lt;/a&gt; with the mayoral election of Bill de Blasio. (In 2016, Kelling himself said that he rebuked the way ‚Äúbroken windows‚Äù and the associated mindset around police discretion enabled cops to enforce laws in a discriminatory fashion.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúAny officer who really wants to do order maintenance has to be able to answer satisfactorily the question, ‚ÄòWhy do you decide to arrest one person who‚Äôs urinating in public and not arrest [another]?‚Äô‚Äù Kelling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-problem-with-broken-windows-policing/&quot;&gt;told Frontline&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúAnd if you can‚Äôt answer that question, if you just say ‚ÄòWell, it‚Äôs common sense,‚Äô you get very, very worried.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, de Blasio has made half-hearted attempts at guiding the NYPD towards a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/7/23/21336402/de-blasios-nypd-neighborhood-policing-plan-draws-outside-look&quot;&gt;community policing model&lt;/a&gt; over the last four years, but folded to police pressure in August by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/08/26/city-council-to-amend-chokehold-law-&quot;&gt;walking back support&lt;/a&gt; for a chokehold ban that criminalizes police ‚Äúsitting, kneeling, or standing‚Äù on a person‚Äôs back or chest ‚Äúin a manner that compresses the diaphragm‚Äù during an arrest.

The PBA then criticized the amendment, saying nothing less than a total repeal would be acceptable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;73.614936440678&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In both friendly and potentially fatal situations, police unions are firm that their ability to &quot;do [their] jobs safely and effectively,&quot; as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gothamist.com/news/city-council-considers-tweaking-chokehold-criminalization-bill-signed-law-last-month&quot;&gt;PBA president Patrick Lynch argued&lt;/a&gt; against the chokehold ban, rests solely on their own judgement, with as few limitations as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Cops have serious social incentives to respect PBA cards‚Äîthe way they handle being presented with one reflects the respect they have for a fellow officer. This dynamic is demonstrated with surprising accuracy, Driscoll said, in a storyline of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In the 2001 episode ‚ÄúAnother Toothpick,‚Äù Tony Soprano brandishes a New Jersey State PBA card when a Black police officer pulls him over for speeding. ‚ÄúI think I had dinner with your boss last week,‚Äù Soprano says slyly as he flashes the card (which bears the name of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/17/nyregion/two-accused-of-siphoning-pba-money.html&quot;&gt;real-life former PBA president Michael J. Madonna&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;After a tense exchange, the officer tickets Soprano anyway. A few scenes later, Soprano runs into the cop working at a garden supply store: Once word of his refusal to let Soprano off the hook got back to his superiors, the cop‚Äôs hours were cut and he was forced to get a second job to recoup the lost income.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúI love &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;,‚Äù Driscoll said. ‚ÄúI laughed at that one!‚Äù But he said the potential disrespect communicated by ignoring a fellow cop‚Äôs PBA card was no joke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;When police officers are presented with a PBA card, they need to make a calculated decision about how seriously to take it. ‚ÄúImagine you're a police officer, you're out there doing your job every single time, and you give your wife, or your brother, or your kid the card. You say, ‚ÄòJust show this to a police officer, and he can always call me and I can talk to him.‚Äô‚Äù Driscoll said. ‚ÄúAnd then the officer comes home and his [family member] says, ‚ÄòThe police officer said, I don't give a shit about that! and gave me a summons.‚Äô&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;long-form__body-group&quot; readability=&quot;136.58295594895&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;You'd be like, 'Damn! I'm in the same work as you, and you couldn't even extend me a courtesy?‚Äô‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;According to Mike, even legitimate PBA cardholders like himself aren‚Äôt immune to scorn when they use them. ‚ÄúI've definitely given the card over and seen an eye-roll or two,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey were ready and willing to give the ticket, and then, when they saw the card, they didn't want to deal with either mailing the card back to the person [if they choose to confiscate it] or getting a phone call from another cop‚Ä¶ I think that's kind of a no-no in their world.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In the seven to 10 times Mike estimates he's presented cops with PBA cards, one instance from earlier this year sticks out in his mind. He said he turned out of a Starbucks parking lot in New Jersey and found himself going the wrong direction on a one-way street. Within seconds, a cop across the street sprang into action, running up to Mike‚Äôs car and ordering him to pull over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Mike picked up on the cop‚Äôs aggressive demeanor immediately. ‚ÄúThis guy had a really short haircut,‚Äù Mike said. ‚ÄúHe had that mean look that you know right away &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe he was just having an off day that day. But I don't think so‚ÄîI think he was just not a nice guy.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Worried, Mike handed over all three PBA cards he had on him in an effort to skirt the ticket. ‚ÄúHe took all of them,‚Äù Mike said, something he'd never experienced before. ‚ÄúHe basically said, ‚ÄòIf I pull you over again, I'm gonna give you a ticket.‚Äô So, some of them are not all butterflies and happy when you give them a PBA card.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;For all the buddy-buddy connotations PBA cards seem to carry, encounters like these underscore the fact that PBA cards aren‚Äôt about cops showing respect to civilians; they‚Äôre about cops respecting each other. Exhibiting restraint, even when they‚Äôd rather crack down, is easiest for officers when there's an implied social or professional cost‚Äîin accepting a PBA card, they're ultimately protecting themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article dropcap&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Police unions tend to be tight-lipped when it comes to discussing PBA cards. The phenomenon is mentioned in the media as early as 1936, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://archives.newyorker.com/newyorker/1936-10-03/flipbook/020/&quot;&gt;profile of a former police commissioner&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, and references to PBA cards continued to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nj.com/njvoices/2012/05/pba_cards_do_they_work_and_sho.html&quot;&gt;crop up&lt;/a&gt; in New York‚Äìarea newspapers throughout the 20th century, generally in connection with &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/12/24/94222587.html?pageNumber=20&quot;&gt;forgery and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/11/09/87428046.html?pageNumber=25&quot;&gt;extortion.&lt;/a&gt; One motorcycle patrolman &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1955/05/04/85692756.html?pageNumber=59&quot;&gt;died by suicide&lt;/a&gt; after he was found guilty of distributing fraudulent courtesy cards. But for the most part, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to get a cop (or even a PBA cardholder) to discuss the custom in detail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Because of this silence, it's tough to get a read on how many PBA cards there are in circulation, and who exactly is holding them. The NYC PBA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nycpba.org/about-the-pba/who-we-are/#:~:text=The%20NYC%20PBA%20represents%20the,administrative%20divisions%20throughout%20the%20city&quot;&gt;caps the number of cards&lt;/a&gt; it gives each of its 24,000 active members at 20 as of 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2018/01/21/police-union-slashes-number-of-get-out-of-jail-free-cards-issued/&quot;&gt;down from 30 the year before&lt;/a&gt;. This was in response to the issue of people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/11/nyregion/a-perk-for-friends-of-the-police-now-on-ebay.html&quot;&gt;selling the cards on eBay&lt;/a&gt; as long ago as 2006 (they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/b/PBA-Card/395/bn_55191557&quot;&gt;still available&lt;/a&gt; there as ‚Äúcollectibles,‚Äù as of this writing). That means there may be up to 480,000 PBA cards issued in 2020 currently in circulation from a single union, in a single city‚Äîa number that does not include cards issued to retired officers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;amp;v=GMmrGGLIgRQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&quot;&gt;2018 interview with VICE News Tonight&lt;/a&gt;, a retired NYPD officer told a reporter, ‚ÄúI can tell you now from inside experience: They don‚Äôt have a clue how many cards are printed because they‚Äôre not serialized. They don‚Äôt inventory the cards. They just give them out.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúIf there's a million of those cards out there, think of the police officer!‚Äù Driscoll said. There is some interest in limiting the number of available cards so that they maintain their significance. ‚ÄúIt gets to the point where it's, &lt;em&gt;I have to issue summonses, I don't give a damn if you have a card or not.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;According to Driscoll, PBA cards are just par for the course when it comes to uneven policing based on an individual officer's judgement‚Äîhe stressed that cops exercise discretion and let people off with warnings all the time, PBA card or not. ‚ÄúPeople can read into it what they want, that it's nefarious‚Ä¶ it's not that big of a deal,‚Äù he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;To Wall, though, courtesy cards are just the opposite: They‚Äôre ‚Äúa window into the larger maze‚Äù of the foundational principles of policing, like discretion, that make the entire institution so unreformable. He believes they reflect the biases, prejudices, and institutionally supported pecking order of policing on the whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;‚ÄúPolicing was never meant to be held accountable in the first place, not in a meaningful, substantial way,‚Äù Wall said. He cautioned against focusing too much on the injustice of PBA cards. ‚ÄúBe careful that the outrage [doesn't] become directed in too narrow a way. The real outrage should be directed at the nature of policing itself.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
