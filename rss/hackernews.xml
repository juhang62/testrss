&lt;p&gt;I recently started using Go‚Äôs new inbuilt vendoring tool, Go Modules, and having come from both govendor and dep, this new tool was more of a change than I expected.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a fan of quick guides ‚Äì just tell me what to do so I can start using it now. I don‚Äôt need an essay on why I should be using it or painful detail on the tool‚Äôs inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a quick guide like this doesn‚Äôt seem to exist, so I‚Äôm writing one here. You‚Äôre welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put your code somewhere other than the gopath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can technically use Go Modules inside the gopath, but you‚Äôll have to manually set GO111MODULES=on in your environment variables.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the whole point of modules is to not have to put your code in the gopath, so don‚Äôt do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initialise Go Modules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run this command in your go project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;go mod init &amp;lt;modulename&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄòModule name‚Äô is whatever you want to call your module. This name should be fairly unique, because if you have module name clashes you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a go.mod file, which you don‚Äôt need to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use go get to add the dependencies to the go.mod file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just run this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;go get -u ./...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will add all of your project‚Äôs current dependencies to the go.mod file and create a go.sum file. You don‚Äôt need to touch that file either.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendor those dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;go mod vendor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a vendor folder and add copies of each dependency listed in your go.mod file to that folder. This folder also can‚Äôt be edited, so again, there‚Äôs no need to touch it.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update a dependency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;go get -u &amp;lt;repo url&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;go mod vendor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will update the dependency version in the go.mod file, and then update the code in your vendor folder for that dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be enough for you to get up and running with Go Modules on your go project.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>SIGIL, a New Doom Campaign by John Romero</title>
<link>https://www.romerogames.ie/sigil/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.romerogames.ie/sigil/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Why did you decide to create a megawad?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: People have been asking me to make an entire episode for many years now, and that picked up a lot after I released E1M8B and E1M4B in 2016. Many messaged me to ask if I‚Äôd consider making a 5th episode for the 25th anniversary. So, back in 2016, that‚Äôs what I decided to do. Like all other mods, it will be free. However, I also wanted to do something special, so we decided to also create an incredible package that fans would love and include an amazing soundtrack by Buckethead. Everything that‚Äôs included in the fan boxes is really cool to show off, and Christopher Lovell‚Äôs art is fitting for such a hellish game. The Beast Box has to be the most evil game box I‚Äôve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What‚Äôs the storyline for Sigil since it takes place after episode 4 and before DOOM II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;¬Æ&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: After killing the Spiderdemon at the end of E4M8 (Unto the Cruel), your next stop is Earth ‚Äî you must save it from hellspawn that is causing unimaginable carnage. But Baphomet glitched the final teleporter with his hidden sigil whose eldritch power brings you to even darker shores of Hell. You fight through this stygian pocket of evil to confront the ultimate harbingers of Satan, then finally return to become Earth‚Äôs savior. In summary, rip and tear!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What is a megawad?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: A megawad is a wad made up of other wads, and a wad is a default file format for DOOM¬Æ and DOOM II¬Æ. It stands for ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs all the data?‚Äù The free version of the SIGIL wad contains several wads that deliver the levels. In the SIGIL fan boxes, we also include Buckethead‚Äôs amazing music. To make it work, you basically drag the SIGIL.WAD file onto gzdoom.exe (or gzdoom.app on a Mac). Sigil‚Äôs numbering scheme is E5Mx where ‚Äúx‚Äù is the level number 1-9. Episode Five, just after Episode Four: Thy Flesh Consumed. To play SIGIL, you must have the registered DOOM.WAD as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: You mentioned that there‚Äôs nine levels in this megawad, as well as nine deathmatch-only levels. Are there eighteen levels in the megawad?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Actually, there are only nine distinct level wad files. It turns out that you can put both the single- player¬†&lt;em&gt;and¬†&lt;/em&gt;the deathmatch levels in the same wad. If you run the wad in deathmatch mode, you spawn in the deathmatch area of the level. If you play Sigil in cooperative mode, you start in the single-player part of the level. This support has been in DOOM¬Æ¬†since the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How did you create Sigil‚Äôs levels?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: I used the incredible Doom Builder 2 by Pascal vd Heiden (with support from several other authors). You can get it at http://doombuilder.com and try making levels yourself ‚Äì it‚Äôs not hard to do. Doom Builder runs on Windows 10. I‚Äôm a Mac person, so I use VMFusion 11 to run Windows 10 and Doom Builder. It works really well in a virtual machine. Even testing levels while making them was lightning-fast. I press a hotkey and gzdoom launches the level and it runs over 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How long did it take you to create Sigil?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: I worked on it part time during 2017 and 2018, mostly while I was on vacation or in the evenings. I wanted to have a surprise for DOOM‚Äôs 25th anniversary. I learned a lot from E1M8B and E1M4B, so I think I did a better job this time. The boss level is terrifying. For me, making this whole episode was a labor of love and a reminder of all the amazing times that we had at id working on the original. I was fortunate to be a part of such a great team and a foundational game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Is there anything new in Sigil‚Äôs levels compared to other mods?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Well, I wanted the levels to feel like they belong to the original game as if they were a true fifth episode. There‚Äôs more detail in the levels than episodes 1-4, but not overly so. I believe that people playing Sigil will recognize my design style, but see new things I‚Äôm doing because this episode does not take place on a military base ‚Äì it takes place in Hell, which is new to me within DOOM¬Æ‚Äôs design space. There‚Äôs a massive room in E5M6 that is the coolest room I‚Äôve created in any map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Why did you work with Buckethead for the music on SIGIL?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Buckethead has been a favorite metal guitarist of mine for a while, and I am so impressed with his output of great music. I feel like I really connect with his playing, and he liked my games as well, so it was a good match. The great MIDI-metal of the original game fit well, and Buckethead‚Äôs music really works perfectly with these new maps. Buckethead has a ton of fans, and thought it would be great to show his fanbase that his music fits in with the most metal game of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Can you talk about working with him on this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: As some of you may know, Buckethead is enigmatic and elusive. Luckily, I was able to get in touch with him. He was excited about making a new song for this megawad, and having some of his amazing Pikes songs included as well. He was very easy to get along with and loves the idea of having his music playing in the background. The custom CD with his music is included in both the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How did you choose the music for the levels?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: It was a gruelling decision process to choose which Pikes to use in SIGIL. There are literally hundreds of choices to consider. The decision process came down to song length and mood. One of the levels is very dark, so I chose a super creepy song that is really different from the rest. I also like the longer songs to have fast and slow parts that might sync with the action onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Are you happy with where id Software has taken the series?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Absolutely. I think DOOM 2016 was an amazing game and deserving of every one of the accolades it got. The team at id is really doing a fantastic job with it, and like everyone else, I am looking forward to DOOM Eternal. To be clear, I don‚Äôt have anything to do with either of these games. I‚Äôm just a fan like everyone else!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Are you in touch with the original DOOM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;¬Æ¬†&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;team?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Yes, we talk from time to time. I see Adrian a fair bit since he has a place here in Ireland (The Heritage in Killenard). I also talk with Tom (Hall) and American (McGee) every once in a while. I‚Äôm in contact with John where there‚Äôs something specific that we both have interest in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Looking back on 25 years of history, what do you think is DOOM&lt;/strong&gt;¬Æ&lt;strong&gt;‚Äôs legacy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: I don‚Äôt think any of us knew that DOOM¬Æ¬†would have the impact that it has had. That people were asking me to make a full episode more than 23 years later? Genuinely, it‚Äôs an incredible honor. Aside from the impact it had on what would become the FPS genre, I believe the most important legacy of DOOM¬Æ¬†is its community, the people who have kept it alive for 25 years through the creation of mods and tools. It‚Äôs not at all lost on me that I have gone from a creator to a part of the community in that space of time, and I love that. My whole life has been about games, and if I hadn‚Äôt been a part of DOOM¬Æ‚Äôs creation, I would have absolutely been a hardcore member of its community. Another thing that‚Äôs been wonderful for me is a story I‚Äôve been hearing a lot lately when I meet fans at tech conferences ‚Äî they talk about having grown up playing DOOM¬Æ¬†with their moms or dads and saying what wonderful memories they have. It‚Äôs a sign of DOOM¬Æ‚Äôs age, for certain, but it‚Äôs also a sign of its longevity. There are also so many people who got into tech because of DOOM¬Æ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are you working on anything else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Of course, and it will be done when it‚Äôs done. :)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>After landing a lucrative job at a tech startup, I had made a terrible mistake</title>
<link>https://torontolife.com/tech/truth-tech-insider-got/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torontolife.com/tech/truth-tech-insider-got/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;our years ago, I made what I hoped was an inspired leap. Since grad school, I‚Äôd worked as a journalist, food critic and editor, mostly at this magazine. Then Vision Critical, a tech start-up, came calling, and I saw a way to apply my skills to a growing industry. I‚Äôd recently turned 40 and was finally getting around to planning a family‚Äîif I was going to change careers, it was now or never. Vision Critical is what‚Äôs known in the tech world as a B2B company‚Äîa business selling to other businesses (as opposed to a B2C, which sells to consumers). Its software helps market researchers at Fortune 500 companies easily collect and analyze feedback from thousands of their customers, replacing older and slower research methods such as mailed surveys and in-person interviews. Vision Critical counted ESPN, Toyota, Hyundai, DeWalt, Adobe and LinkedIn as clients. In Canada, it had Maple Leaf Foods and Canadian Tire. But outside of those offices, it wasn‚Äôt a well-known company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had become trendy for tech companies to hire media refugees like me to serve as ‚Äúbrand storytellers‚Äù instead of spending millions on conventional advertising. Vision Critical had invented a position for me on the marketing team‚Äîsenior director, content. I knew next to nothing about promoting software to market researchers, yet I would be overseeing an in-house propaganda machine of writers, videographers, graphic designers and social media managers. My salary would be double that of the average magazine editor. I signed the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new employer occupied two floors in a tower at Yonge and Bloor. On my first day, the office manager ordered me, the newbie, to push the afternoon beer cart. My co-workers lived for beer-o‚Äôclock. You probably assume, like I did, that tech start-ups are staffed exclusively with antisocial computer nerds. The reality is that the software developers (called ‚Äúdevs‚Äù) are usually outnumbered by sales, and the sales team was a testosterone-charged, protein shake‚Äìfuelled, almost all-male team. For all the aspirational talk of gender equality in tech, men far outnumber women, and most of the women on staff worked in ‚Äúcustomer success‚Äù‚Äîaccount managers who in effect served as our clients‚Äô personal assistants and whose ultimate responsibility was to ensure those valuable clients never ‚Äúchurned‚Äù (i.e., cancelled their contracts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales bros remade the office into their frat house, hanging alma mater pennants over their desks, playing pranks, tossing mini-footballs and bringing bulk bags of Doritos to meetings. Sometimes they wore suits to impress clients, but mostly they worked the phones in Jays jerseys. They‚Äôd clang a cowbell every time a big deal got signed. Many were just a few years out of university and already making six-figure commissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks into my new job, I boarded a plane with 200 colleagues bound for the Hard Rock Hotel in Cancun. In case you‚Äôve never been, here‚Äôs a snapshot: the lobby is a museum of pop star cast-offs, with vitrines of a lime green James Brown suit, a sequined Cher jumpsuit (is there any other kind?), and a pair of Britney Spears‚Äôs boots; the mini-fridges in the rooms contain full-size bottles of tequila, rum, vodka and whisky; and the DJ beside the main pool doesn‚Äôt take requests. Our sales, marketing and customer success teams had assembled there for SKO‚Äîthe company‚Äôs annual sales kickoff, a combination training session, town hall and week-long party. The executives got their own rooms, and everyone else doubled up. I shared a room featuring a two-person hot tub with Bruce, another recent hire‚Äîhe was known on the marketing team for calling long meetings to review intricately colour-coded Gantt charts. I‚Äôd been to many off-sites in my previous jobs, usually in nearby, windowless hotel conference spaces. Never had my employer flown me to a tropical resort. There was some work to do: we spent hours watching presentations on sales techniques, product updates and competitor analyses. At one point, for reasons unexplained, two of the sales directors hustled onstage a resort employee dressed in a Barney costume and did a little dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Staff would compete for the ‚Äúsombrero of shame,‚Äù worn by the person who‚Äôd partied the hardest the previous night&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had grown fast, and many of the SKO attendees were recent hires like Bruce and me. Yet I seemed to be the only person even mildly surprised when Andrew Reid, the company‚Äôs 30-something founder and a legendary partier, arrived at the first night‚Äôs party in Burt Reynolds aviators, a disco pantsuit and a flaming-red mohawk wig. He passed around tequila shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentations about sales targets and so on were really just a prelude to something more important. Our Cancun week was about building company culture. Culture is an obsession at start-ups. They talk about it nearly as much as they talk about sales targets. Our company culture, we were assured, was what set us apart from our competitors. Other companies might claim to be disruptors, but we were the true revolutionaries and world-changers. Old-school companies like the one I‚Äôd left were dismissively referred to as legacy industries‚Äîslow, pitiful and ready for retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One afternoon, we split into teams and, equipped only with our cellphone cameras and our wits, competed to create the best promo video about our company culture. Competitiveness, I was discovering, was a core value. That week, we competed at beach volleyball, we competed at rounds of golf and we competed at knocking back margaritas. At the start of each Cancun morning, we‚Äôd all stumble into a conference room and Andrew Reid would summon to the stage the employee who‚Äôd partied the hardest the previous night. We‚Äôd cheer and whoop. It was an SKO tradition for that person to wear the ‚Äúsombrero of shame‚Äù for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt get to wear the sombrero, but I was having more fun than I‚Äôd ever expected to on a work trip. And, after the third or fourth night of tequila rounds, I was starting to feel like less of an outsider. My co-workers seemed genuinely interested in me and what I would be contributing to Vision Critical. This wasn‚Äôt a job in any sense I was familiar with‚Äîwhen the executives told us that we were all winners, everyone nodded in agreement instead of rolling their eyes. It felt good to be among people who looked to the future with so much irony-free optimism. Maybe I was also a super-competitive high-performer. Maybe we really were disruptors, revolutionaries and world-changers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last day, we boarded coaches for an outdoor supper club on the beach. It was formal night‚Äîdresses and heels, chinos and jackets. A mariachi band started up as we sat down to eat. There were more speeches about the great things we‚Äôd accomplish in the year ahead. If all went according to plan, the company was headed for an IPO‚Äîthe start-up holy grail. We clinked glasses and hollered a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, behind my seat, a bubble of commotion, a dropped beer bottle, laughter. I turned around to see three of the sales bros stripping off their clothes and running naked, full tilt, into the pitch-black surf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;f it seems like everyone you know is leaving their outmoded legacy job for a start-up, that‚Äôs because they are. The late-‚Äô90s dot-com boom and bust‚Äîwhen companies like pets.com burned through millions in venture capital funding and flamed out months after an IPO‚Äîlargely passed over Toronto. It was a Silicon Valley phenomenon. Today‚Äôs boom is wised-up, diversified, global, and Toronto is one of its most active hubs. AngelList, a service that connects investors with tech entrepreneurs, counts more than 5,000 start-ups in the city. And some 400,000 people are working in tech in the Toronto, Peel and York regions‚Äîa number that‚Äôs growing by the thousands every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I confessed to my media colleagues that I was abandoning them for tech, the reaction was surprise followed by jealousy. Tech was glamorous. I had a security pass to Silicon Valley North, and they didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôd seen stories about new start-up offices with meditation rooms, in-house baristas, free lunches, powered standing desks and beanbags as far as the eye could see. They wanted that. They wanted to leave the legacy industry death march. How could they get their own passcards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech is where all the money is going. The mystical aura around start-ups‚Äîof fast wealth, fun and rooms full of brainiacs‚Äîis why the prime minister is always touting ‚Äúsuperclusters.‚Äù That aura is also what seduces investors into betting millions on every tech founder with a half-decent PowerPoint pitch. The funding announcements from Toronto start-ups come so frequently that we‚Äôve become blas√© about the volume of money pumping into the industry. Ten years ago, tech entrepreneurs complained that Toronto would never take off because of a shortage of venture capital. Today, they‚Äôre fighting off interested investors. Wealthsimple, the online consumer investment service, has raised more than $167 million, the vast majority of it from Power Corp‚Äôs Paul Desmarais III. Wattpad, a company whose apps let self-publishers share stories (mostly teen girls writing fan fiction), has raised $101 million over six rounds of funding, including $38 million at the beginning of this year from China-based Tencent Holdings. Then there are the comparatively lesser piles of money raised by companies like the health benefits service League ($85 million), the marketing software company Uberflip ($44 million) and the ‚Äúbrand advocate‚Äù mobilization company Influitive ($41 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vision Critical‚Äôs early funding came from Andrew Reid‚Äôs wealthy father, Angus Reid, who‚Äôd sold his market research company to Ipsos for $100 million. In total, Vision Critical raised $41.8 million from blue-chip investors. An especially large chunk came from OMERS Ventures, the tech speculation arm of the Ontario municipal workers‚Äô pension fund. In the start-up world, your chances of success have as much to do with the impact of your tech as with the smarts and reputation of your investors. It doesn‚Äôt get much better than investment from OMERS Ventures, which supported three of Canada‚Äôs most recognized tech companies: the social media management software company Hootsuite, the learning management system D2L and, most famous of all, the e-commerce company Shopify, whose stock value has ballooned by 500 per cent since its 2015 IPO. Vision Critical was next. Get ready, our leaders said, to ride a rocket ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More proof of Vision Critical‚Äôs promise: Derek Smyth, the managing director at OMERS Ventures who led the investment in Vision Critical, left OMERS in 2014 to become our COO. Smyth was legendary in the Canadian tech world. He sat on a dozen boards and had a reputation as the Zen master of accelerated growth. He was imposing: as tall and broad as a bear, with a shiny bald dome and dad glasses. We rarely saw him; he was always on flights to the company‚Äôs satellite offices or to elite conferences, only replying to emails in the dead of night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Some mornings, I had to reassure myself I hadn‚Äôt joined a cult. We were teammates, not co-workers, and our meetings would end with a rousing ‚ÄúGo team!‚Äù&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was being vetted for the job, Smyth invited me for a lunch meeting. His assistant ordered us boxed salads and seated us in a boardroom. Smyth said he didn‚Äôt need to ask why I wanted to leave my magazine job‚Äîthe answer was apparently self-evident. What he wanted to know was, what did I think of Vision Critical‚Äôs name? I paused, weighing whether it was a bad move to dump on the brand before I had even been hired. I opted for brutal honesty and said it sounded like a company from the early 2000s, possibly the name of a contact lens manufacturer. He nodded, hands forming a triangle under his chin. Great, he said‚Äîlet‚Äôs change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;ens of millions in venture capital induces nausea. And panic. The bigger the investment, the more intense the pressure from your board and investors to deliver extremely fast growth and position for an IPO. Start-up founders all seem to believe in the principle of ‚Äú10X‚Äù from the 2011 business book &lt;em&gt;The 10X Rule,&lt;/em&gt; which argues that the only scale of growth worth pursuing is a target 10 times greater than your current size. Anything less is a waste of time. The objective is not to compete with other companies; it‚Äôs to obliterate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, broadly speaking, two categories of tech founders. The most common is the engineer who, slaving for hours in the proverbial garage, programs his (or, infrequently, her) way to glory and gets showered with millions by venture capitalists. He is the tech clich√©‚Äînerdy and socially awkward. He wears T-shirts and hoodies, no matter the occasion, and probably bought four dozen of the same T-shirt so he doesn‚Äôt need to waste time thinking about what to wear. He‚Äôs startled when his company scales fast and he suddenly needs to hire hundreds of staff and learn how to keep them happy. His approach to any decision about his software or his staff is that of an engineer: look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other founder type is the rich or well-connected man (or, infrequently, woman) who, like Vision Critical‚Äôs Andrew Reid, has a clever idea for an app or a software service and enlists engineers to help him build and improve it. This type of founder styles himself as a visionary. He yearns for speaking invitations to elite tech summits. He wants to see his name in ‚Äú40 under 40‚Äù lists, to be quoted regularly in &lt;em&gt;Forbes, Fast Company&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek.&lt;/em&gt; He closely follows the trajectories of his peers and burns with envy when they get more attention. Says &lt;em&gt;The 10X Rule:&lt;/em&gt; the biggest problem in business is obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Reid had gone to film school in Vancouver, picked up HTML and Photoshop, and got into tech. He founded Vision Critical in 2000. By the time I was hired, he was in his late 30s, but his standard uniform, even when he took meetings with investors or clients, was that of a perpetual teen: scuffed Air Jordans, shredded skinny jeans and hair sculpted into Bart Simpson spikes. His office was cluttered with skateboards, vintage Mac computers and photos of himself snowboarding‚Äîhe owns a chalet in the Rockies and takes his friends heli-skiing on weekends. In 2012, Vision Critical‚Äôs investors and board installed a confident CEO named Scott Miller, who had an impressive track record building global brands. The company moved Andrew into a different role‚Äîleading a non-revenue-generating division exploring new product ideas. He was also responsible for company culture, which involved making sure the company party had a good DJ and organizing the weekly movie night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Our lingo was dense with acronyms. It took me a day of overhearing my teammates discuss tofu before I realized they were referring to TOFU, the top of the funnel&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially mystified by how a company that‚Äôs been around since 2000 could still call itself a start-up. It turns out it‚Äôs not unusual for software companies to hold on to the start-up classification long after the point when businesses in other industries would be considered established. Software companies are forever ‚Äúpivoting‚Äù‚Äîchanging their business plans, chasing emerging markets, pushing their platform in new directions. The day I joined, Vision Critical had some 700 staff and two main offices: most of the execs, the sales team and I were housed in Toronto, high above Yonge and Bloor, while Andrew Reid and the majority of the devs were in Vancouver, where they‚Äôd taken over part of a tower that used to house the &lt;em&gt;Vancouver Sun&lt;/em&gt; newsroom. The company also had sales offices in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. It was established, but it was also very much a start-up, and had only recently pivoted the business to cloud-based market research software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start-ups are all about change and believing it‚Äôll pay off. Change is better than certainty, agility better than stability. Or, as one senior vice-president put it in a stump motivational speech, ‚ÄúWe need to fix the plane and fly it at the same time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ome mornings, I had to reassure myself I hadn‚Äôt joined a cult. We certainly showed cult-like tics. We were teammates, not co-workers. We‚Äôd assemble for ‚Äústandups‚Äù‚Äîteam meetings in which, while standing in a circle, we‚Äôd report on the progress of the current ‚Äúsprint‚Äù (project), identify ‚Äúblockers‚Äù (self-explanatory) and end with a ‚ÄúGo team!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cult‚Äôs lingo was dense with acronyms, which I figured was because speaking in complete words is too slow for such a fast-paced industry. On beanbags, at the pop fridge, and at the foosball table, we discussed KPIs (key performance indicators), CAC (customer acquisition cost), ROI (return on investment) and asked our BDRs (business development reps‚Äîjunior salespeople) to update us on the latest developments in the CRM (customer relationship management software). It took me a day of overhearing my teammates discuss tofu before I realized they were referring to TOFU, the top of the funnel‚Äîmarketing jargon for the degree to which a customer was aware of our products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months in, I started to see through the acronyms and the carefully maintained optimism of my teammates. For all the talk of agility and disruption and 10X, there was a deep fear of fucking up. A bad decision about a product, a marketing campaign or a sales tactic could cost the business millions. When there was no data to back up a decision, we suffered paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Smyth had given his blessing to look into a name change for the company. None of the executives, aside from perhaps Andrew Reid, was fond of the existing one. So we quietly hired an outside consultant to conduct a study of the brand and make a recommendation for a new name. The consultant spent months interviewing people throughout the company as well as its customers, studying the market, and leading a subset of employees through word-association exercises to pinpoint our core identity. In the end, he presented us with a handful of alternatives, all vaguely tech-sounding, none memorable. Worse: we had no compelling data to convince us that a new name would improve sales. The report got buried. We kept the company name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Even the most junior marketing specialist was expected to be always on-call, day or night. Anything less was inconceivable&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù or Facebook‚Äôs ‚ÄúBring the world closer together,‚Äù Vision Critical had a motto: ‚ÄúPeople matter.‚Äù It was supposed to encapsulate the value that clients got from the company‚Äôs software‚Äîreliable feedback directly from real people. It appeared on the ‚Äúabout us‚Äù page of the company‚Äôs website and on the T-shirts we wore to work. It was part of our sales pitch and was repeated, like a call to arms, at our company town halls. It struck me as hollow. Who, after all, believes that people &lt;em&gt;don‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; matter? We ignored the small irony that our clients had to use our software, a digital intermediary, to collect information about their customers‚Äîthe people who mattered. What our software ‚Äúdisrupted‚Äù was the unpleasant tedium of a market researcher interviewing customers in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the motto, the execs cared first and foremost about our work ethic and maximizing productivity. People I met at other start-ups said the same thing. The reason the company entrusted you with a laptop and a brand new iPhone (with unlimited data!) wasn‚Äôt because the company was cool‚Äîit was so you could take your work home with you, so you could always be reached and always be accountable. Even the beer cart was a ploy to own your time instead of letting you leave the office for a pub. If another team member ‚Äúpinged‚Äù you in the middle of the night about the status of a project, you‚Äôd better respond or be labelled ‚Äúnot a team player.‚Äù It was a full-time job just keeping up with team communications: we exchanged messages over iMessage and Google Talk, over several dozen team channels on the team productivity apps Slack and Basecamp, over the chat function on our Salesforce database and, of course, by email. I‚Äôd had jobs where I had to be available after hours, but here even the most junior marketing specialist was expected to be always on-call, day or night. Anything less wouldn‚Äôt get us to 10X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was the biggest surprise about working in tech: even though everyone wears their team T-shirts and hoodies, rah-rah chants at the monthly all-staff meetings and competes for the sombrero of shame at the tropical off-site, no one loves the start-up they work for. No one feels secure. No one is loyal. There‚Äôs no certainty your start-up will exist in a year‚Äîor next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd held on as long as possible to the fantasy, sold to me by &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street,&lt;/em&gt; that the people in your neighbourhood‚Äîthe newsstand operator, the dentist, the shop owner, the taxi driver, the teacher, and the grouch in the trash can‚Äîhave jobs for life. That they‚Äôre fixed objects. If you need a newspaper, the newsstand operator will always be there. They‚Äôre the people you meet each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A job for life also meant that your job was your life. You went into teaching or sports reporting or proctology because it was a calling‚Äîit was who you were meant to be. But it‚Äôs been a long time since anyone has been able to count on a job for life. The tech industry led the way: our shift to precarious employment was hastened by more efficient algorithms, apps and Amazon. No legacy industry was safe from disruption. The 2008 financial reckoning forced companies‚Äîor gave them the excuse‚Äîto replace staff positions with cost-efficient contract workers and orchestrate attrition by a thousand humiliating cuts. Company pensions and RRSP matching now seem like quaint throwbacks to an innocent time. Our cubicles were replaced by Dickensian open-concept rows of computer terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precarious employment is the new normal. The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives found that 22 per cent of Canadian professionals lack stable jobs or don‚Äôt feel secure in their full-time jobs, and that women are disproportionately affected. In the U.S., a study conducted by two leading economics professors found that ‚Äúalternative work arrangements,‚Äù which include contract work and gig-economy income from companies like Uber and TaskRabbit, accounted for as much as 94 per cent of the net growth in jobs from 2005 to 2015. Peter Fleming, a professor of business and society at the University of London, writes in &lt;em&gt;The Death of Homo Economicus,&lt;/em&gt; not without hints of disbelief and anger, that we live in a state of ‚Äúwreckage capitalism.‚Äù Tech companies, he says, have cynically taken advantage of a generation of workers by packaging temporary ‚Äúsharing economy‚Äù work as self-determination and delicious freedom. The same phenomenon drives the growth of co-working property managers like WeWork, which, capitalizing on the new reality of so many free agent workers without offices to call home, will rent you a temporary desk. The company plans to open a total of 20 shared workspace locations in downtown Toronto by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pining for a long-term job was incredibly old-fashioned of me. A month didn‚Äôt go by without a hiring, a departure or a shift in the direction of the company. My marketing colleagues were forever burnishing their personal brands by @-mentioning influential marketers on Twitter and fluffing their profiles and skill sets on LinkedIn. They would often disappear to take calls with prospective employers. For the first time in my life, as soon as I updated my LinkedIn profile to ‚Äúcontent marketer,‚Äù headhunters and recruiters contacted &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; wanting to convince me of a great new opportunity. My teammates spoke of ‚ÄúVision Critical years‚Äù as if they were dog years. So much happened every day‚Äîwe juggled so many initiatives and worked so many nights and weekends‚Äîthat a month felt like a year, and a year like an eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work approach was lifted from &lt;em&gt;The Challenger Sale: Taking Control of the Customer Conversation,&lt;/em&gt; another business book with a dedicated following at software companies. Every project my marketing teammates pursued was evaluated on whether it was ‚Äúchallenger enough.‚Äù The book‚Äôs thesis, in effect, is that the best marketing and salespeople are demonic Tony Robbinses who manipulate prospective clients with an onslaught of terrifying facts about why their seemingly stable world is about to crumble beneath them. The authors call this process ‚Äúrational drowning.‚Äù Inspired by this approach, I‚Äôd poke at our prospective customers‚Äô insecurities with blog posts, video testimonials and white papers addressing all the forces changing their industry, then hit them with even more bad news, pushing them deeper and deeper into the muddy waters of misery. If I did my job right, they would independently come to the realization that our software promised salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h6&gt;The biggest surprise about working in tech: even though everyone rah-rah chants at the monthly all-staff meetings, no one loves the start-up they work for&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the media world, my goal was to get the story right and be worthy of the readers‚Äô trust. In marketing, I was using my storytelling skills to manipulate our audience, to make them believe they had deep problems and ultimately point them to a salesperson who stood to make a huge commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year of preying on customers‚Äô anxieties, I began attending a meetup of fellow Toronto tech marketers. There were representatives from big companies like Influitive and Wealthsimple and smaller start-ups like Pressly, Collage and Crowdriff. The agenda was to trade marketing tips, but each meeting inevitably became a group therapy session. We‚Äôd commiserate about our bosses, team tensions and the challenge of hiring from Toronto‚Äôs small talent pool for specialized roles. We‚Äôd also gossip about the companies that had just raised another round of funding, the ones that were rumoured to be burning through cash too fast and the ones that had badly missed their targets. We speculated about what start-up was positioning itself for an IPO or to be acquired. We all dreamed of getting in on the ground floor of a unicorn‚Äîa company that grows incredibly fast and hits a billion-dollar valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the office and at meetups, I ran into a breed of serial start-up employee: opportunists who would strategically jump from company to company, looking for the biggest payout. They‚Äôd usually stick with a company for one year‚Äînever more than four‚Äîthen split. Their LinkedIn profiles read like Yellow Pages for Canadian tech. Someone eventually explained this phenomenon to me: most start-ups, including Vision Critical, offer employees stock options, but you can only buy them in stages. A quarter of your options vest on the first anniversary of your employment, and the remaining get released over subsequent years. Like office perks, stock options are a tactic to encourage you to feel personal investment in your work‚Äîif you perform at 110 per cent, and the company succeeds, then your options are worth more. These serial employees didn‚Äôt fall for it. Once they got their options, they moved on to another firm to acquire more. If one of those companies IPO‚Äôd, they‚Äôd walk away rich and retire before 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wished I was smart enough to be a serial start-up employee. I liked my teammates and enjoyed the parts of my job that were most like my life back in media, but there was far more manipulation and tedium. My what-the-hell-am-I-doing moment came during a surreal debate I had with Andrew while helping him script a presentation for a high-stakes company conference. He wanted to make a point about how badly some companies (that is, companies that weren‚Äôt smart enough to use our software) treat their customers, and envisioned a slide emblazoned with the statement, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt treat me like a piece of shit.‚Äù I tried to dissuade him on the grounds that the conference‚Äôs audience of prim market researchers wouldn‚Äôt appreciate profanity. I‚Äôd think I had him convinced, only to fall back into the debate. This went on for what felt like hours. Instead, he wondered if we could show the smiling poop emoji. He‚Äôd worn me down. Anyhow, it was his company‚Äîthere was no stopping him. On the day of the presentation, the audience loved it. A month later, at the end of 2016, I received an offer from another tech company. I quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t was time for round two. I‚Äôd been recruited by Top Hat, then a seven-year-old Toronto tech start-up. The company‚Äôs software was used by professors, mostly at public colleges in the U.S., to quiz students in large lecture halls via their smartphones. The timing of my move felt right: Vision Critical was suddenly under a lot of scrutiny from business journalists and its investors because of a protracted fight between some board members and Andrew‚Äôs dad Angus, who remained a major stakeholder. Angus was displeased by the executives‚Äô plan to sell off the company‚Äôs market research services division (close to his heart) and focus on its cloud-based subscription software. The executives, especially Derek Smyth, believed a software focus would better position the company for an IPO, but all the fighting raised doubts about whether the company was ever going to pull one off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Top Hat‚Äôs appeal to me was its size: just a couple of hundred employees in an office at Yonge and Carlton. I was ‚Äúgetting in on the ground floor,‚Äù with potentially more valuable stock options. The company was also swimming in venture capital‚Äîit had just raised a Series C round of $17 million. That buys a lot of beanbags. It also meant investors expected incredibly fast growth from tiny Top Hat. The newest rounds of investment were predicated on Top Hat going one giant, 10X-style step further: becoming an inescapable teaching platform with a lucrative digital textbook service. If we were successful, we‚Äôd displace legacy textbook publishers. Said the execs: we are disruptors, revolutionaries and world-changers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Hat had genuine IPO momentum. The founders, Mike Silagadze and Mohsen Shahini, almost never left the office. They met while studying engineering at the University of Waterloo. Mike served as CEO. (There are three prominent start-up CEOs in Toronto named Mike‚ÄîLeague‚Äôs Mike Serbinis, Wealthsimple‚Äôs Mike Katchen and Top Hat‚Äôs Mike Silagadze‚Äîand they‚Äôre known as ‚Äúthe Mikes.‚Äù) He was the type of engineer who solves problems by examining the data. He wore a Top Hat T-shirt or a Top Hat hoodie (or both) every day, without fail. He had a hands-on management style‚Äîhe stood at a standing desk in the same open-concept room as everyone else, personally interviewed all new recruits and, even though he was always overcommitting to meetings, refused to hire an executive assistant. I really liked him: he was smart and accomplished but humble and always transparent‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt play games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike was analytical and data-driven but, like Andrew Reid, given to whims. One week, he was convinced we should buy all the billboards along the Gardiner so we could lure more high-performing sales team members. Another week, he wanted to do the same thing but throughout the subway. Neither came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach our revenue goals for 2017, the company had to nearly double the size of its sales team. Over the year, the marketing team would grow even faster: from five to 25. Soon we were too big for our office, and half of the staff relocated. The plan was for everyone to reunite in a new, three-storey Bloor-Yorkville headquarters with the usual start-up frills (foosball tables, beanbags, yoga sessions). We all joined a dedicated Instagram account with photo updates of the renovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h6&gt;I don‚Äôt miss the rowing competitions, the beanbag meetings, wearing the team T-shirts or pushing the beer cart&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were planning to move into the new space, Mike decided he wanted an awesome sculpture in the lobby. (‚ÄúAwesome‚Äù is a favourite superlative of tech founders.) As the guy in charge of our content marketing program and PR, I was somehow also responsible for the sculpture. Mike‚Äôs idea: a tree of knowledge. When I pointed out that Wattpad had a tree sculpture in its office, he backtracked. I proposed an open-call for artist submissions and ran through the costs of a competition and a guesstimate to manufacture the winning sculpture. After we‚Äôd moved in, the lobby became home to ping-pong and foosball tables. There was no more talk of a sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn‚Äôt take long to see that the culture at Top Hat wasn‚Äôt all that different from Vision Critical. The pressure to deliver was extreme and the hours long. The sales bros tossed mini-footballs and clanged a gong (instead of a cowbell) when they closed a big deal. At our monthly all-team town hall, while we drank beer and ate pizza, Mike would run through the names of the new hires, asking them to stand. It often seemed like a third of the people in the room were new. Was that really possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff morale was a constant preoccupation. Our weekly internal e-newsletter was mostly read for the upcoming week‚Äôs lunch menu and the list of ‚Äúshout-outs‚Äù congratulating Top Hatters who lived and breathed company values. Our values: ‚ÄúAggressive growth,‚Äù ‚ÄúTreat professors like heroes,‚Äù ‚ÄúGood in the woods‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere is no I in Top Hat.‚Äù The first two are self-explanatory, the third a fanciful way of encouraging us to be resourceful under any circumstances, and the Kumbaya-ish ‚ÄúNo I‚Äù value seemed in direct conflict with the general mood in every start-up of cutthroat one-upmanship. In a typical e-newsletter, team members would be congratulated for ‚Äúbeing a savage BDR,‚Äù ‚Äúbeing a true warrior‚Äù and ‚Äúkilling your quota.‚Äù Sales fought to be at the top of the leaderboard, the customer success team to complete the most calls in one day, and the marketing team for a weekly ‚Äúmarketing ninja‚Äù trophy. For a team bonding afternoon, we raced one another at an indoor rowing gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a month, the ‚Äúpeople team‚Äù (i.e, the human resources and recruiting staff) asked everyone to fill out a Net Promoter Score, a simple survey that asked if we‚Äôd recommend Top Hat as a place to work. Companies usually rely on NPS surveys to quickly assess if their products and services are making their customers happy‚Äînot as blunt instruments to measure internal morale. And if the score was low‚Äîas it often was, month after month, for the marketing team‚Äîthe executives frowned and asked, without hiding their exasperation, what was wrong. Were the lunches not good enough? Did people want more flavours of pop? Should we book more rowing competitions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told that the NPS was anonymous, but I had my doubts. At the start of last year, I became a net detractor‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt recommend the company. I was burnt out, bored by the narrow scope of our marketing campaigns and irritated by the extra responsibilities I was told to gamely take on despite having little expertise or interest. I was also depressed by the constant churn of team members leaving for other jobs or, in one case, for a year of travel to places far away from BDRs, CRM, CAC and TOFU. At our weekly one-on-one meetings (what we booked in our calendars as ‚Äú1::1‚Äù), my supervisor would probe, more pointedly than usual, about my mood. After months of this, at another uncomfortable 1::1, we agreed that I wasn‚Äôt a good fit. Two weeks later, I was free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; don‚Äôt miss the acronym conversations, the rowing competitions, the beanbag meetings, pushing the beer cart or wearing the team T-shirts. If I ever go back to Cancun, I‚Äôll skip the Hard Rock. In my Instagram feed, I‚Äôll sometimes see photos of Top Hat and Vision Critical staff cheering each other on at ping-pong and group-hugging for the camera, and I can hardly believe that was my daily life. I meet regularly for drinks with two fellow ex‚ÄìVision Critical marketers‚Äîwe‚Äôre stuck with one another for life, like survivors of a hostage-taking. In the year after I left Vision Critical, Andrew Reid resigned from his executive position to run a new start-up he called VC Labs. The company parties must be a lot less fun without him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving Top Hat, I met with recruiters and execs at a dozen start-ups about another marketing position. There was always something being revolutionized: meal delivery, small-business investment, retail-supply forecasting, mattresses, even corporate charitable giving. I‚Äôd talk about the challenger-style campaigns I‚Äôd produced, they‚Äôd brag about their team culture and perks, and I‚Äôd walk out feeling queasy and certain I‚Äôd never accept an offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I‚Äôm back working in magazines‚ÄîI‚Äôve recently become an editor at &lt;em&gt;Chatelaine.&lt;/em&gt; There‚Äôs no certainty the publication will exist in a year, or even next month. The same is true of every media company these days. But I fit on this team, and I‚Äôm happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after turning in my Top Hat laptop and security pass did I admit to myself that I was never a true disruptor. Tech companies always equate efficiency and speed with virtue and perfection. Top Hat‚Äôs software could very well make higher education more efficient but possibly less rewarding and meaningful for the student. The legacy textbook publishers the company wants to disrupt aren‚Äôt perfect, sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they need to be destroyed. Those publishers do many things very well, and they do them slowly, with great care, for a reason. We should resist change for change‚Äôs sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm being na√Øve, aren‚Äôt I?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU Copyright: Block Everything, Never Make Mistakes, but Don&amp;#039;t Use Upload Filter</title>
<link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181210/09323241194/latest-eu-copyright-proposal-block-everything-never-make-mistakes-dont-use-upload-filters.shtml</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181210/09323241194/latest-eu-copyright-proposal-block-everything-never-make-mistakes-dont-use-upload-filters.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As we've been discussing the &quot;Trilogue&quot; negotiations between the EU Commission, EU Council and EU Parliament over the EU's Copyright Directive have continued, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5498038-article-13-trilogue-proposal.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;summary has been released&lt;/a&gt; on the latest plans for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=article+13&quot;&gt;Article 13&lt;/a&gt;, which is the provision that will make upload filters mandatory, while (and this is the fun part) insisting that it doesn't make upload filters mandatory. Then, to make things even more fun, another document on the actual text suggests the way to deal with this is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5498538-SPOLITICO-18121018260-1-1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create a better euphemism for filters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we last checked in on this, we noted that the legacy film and television industry associations were freaking out that Article 13 might &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181204/06513241153/latest-eu-copyright-directive-no-ones-happy-with-article-13-so-maybe-lets-drop-it.shtml&quot;&gt;include some safe harbors&lt;/a&gt; for internet platforms, and were asking the negotiators to either drop those protections for platforms, or to leave them out of Article 13 altogether and only have it apply to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest brief description of the recommendations for Article 13 appear to be an attempt by bureaucrats who have no understanding of the nuances of this issue to appease both the legacy copyright industries &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the tech companies. Notably absent: any concern for the public or independent creators. We'll dig in in a moment, but frankly, given the state of Article 13 demonstrated in this two-page document, it is horrific that these discussions are considered almost concluded. It is obvious that the vast majority of people working on this have no idea what they're talking about, and are pushing incredibly vague rules without any understanding of their impact. And rather than taking in the criticism and warning from knowledgeable experts, they're just adding in duct-taped &quot;but this won't do x&quot; for every complaint where people warn what the actual impact of the rules will be for the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why, throughout this document, they keep insisting that there will be no mandate for filters. But, there's no way you can actually avoid liability without filters. Indeed, in order to appease the film and TV folks, the proposal &lt;strong&gt;now includes a notice-and-staydown provision&lt;/strong&gt;. We've spent years explaining why a notice-and-staydown provision is not only unworkable, but would lead to tremendous amounts of non-infringing content being removed. Copyright is extremely context specific. The exact same content may be infringing in one instance, but protected in another. Yet a notice-and-staydown does not allow the protected versions. It requires they be blocked. That is outright censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the document. It starts with seven &quot;guidelines.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Commission was requested to follow these guidelines indicated by the Rapporteur:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platforms should follow high standards of duty of care;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cooperation should not be unidirectional;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non infringing content should remain on the platform online;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Automatic blocking, albeit non forbidden, should be avoided as much as possible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Existing measures should not be excluded&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platforms should not always be released from liability by merely applying content identification measures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rightholders should not be in a worse position than they are currently. In this context the audiovisual sector was singled out. On this basis, the following ideas, which are based on a logical grouping of the above guidelines, are outlined for the consideration of the co-legislators:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be summed up as... all infringing content must disappear, but you don't have to use filters and you must make sure that non-infringing content remains online. This is the &quot;nerd harder&quot; approach to regulating. It is magic wand regulating: make the bad stuff go away, and magically don't have any collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not sound policy making. This is technically illiterate bureaucrats trying to cover their asses. Because the liability requirements in the document will certainly lead to massive overblocking and widespread unintended consequences, these spineless technocrats are trying to avoid that by just tacking on &quot;but let those consequences happen.&quot; They don't explain how this is possible. They just are going to put these rules out into the world, and tell the tech industry to wave a magic wand and make one type of content disappear without impacting other content (even if they're impossible to distinguish, and if the penalties for getting it wrong are dire).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the document provides &quot;details&quot; never apparently recognizing just how contradictory the plans are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High standard of duty of care and bilateral cooperation (1 + 2) Online content sharing service providers, as defined in the directive, are considered to communicate to the public and as such need to obtain licences from the relevant rightholders. Where no licences are granted, online content sharing service providers and rightholders should cooperate in good faith to prevent the availability of protected content online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cooperation should take place according to appropriate standards of professional diligence, which ought to take into account the size of the service, the number and type of works or other subject matter uploaded by users, the potential economic harm caused to rightholders, the availability of suitable and effective technologies and their cost for service providers. In practice, this means that the standards of cooperation should be particularly high for high value content. Cooperation should not lead to a general monitoring obligation as defined under the e-Commerce Directive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic wand thinking: Either your entire platform needs to be licensed (i.e., no user-generated content) &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; you need to &quot;prevent the availability&quot; of any copyright-covered content with &quot;good faith.&quot; But how? Well, the bureaucrats insist that this shouldn't require &quot;general monitoring&quot; (i.e., an upload filter). But... um... how do you prevent availability of copyright covered content if you're not monitoring? This is an impossible situation and either the bureaucrats know this and are just ignoring that they're demanding the impossible, or they don't understand this and shouldn't be allowed within 10 miles of any regulation over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rightholders should provide content sharing service providers with specific information (e.g. metadata) allowing identification of their content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cooperation could include content identification measures (e.g. for high value content) but should not prevent other forms of cooperation if agreed by the parties (e.g. ex post content moderation for low value content, see also letter B).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When unauthorised content becomes available on their websites, content sharing service providers would in general not be liable if they have cooperated in good faith according to the relevant standards of professional diligence. However, within an adequate framework to ensure legal certainty, when despite such cooperation the availability of content online has caused significant economic harm to rightholders the Directive could consider the provider liable in any event, but at a reduced level taking into account the good faith of the provider. Alternatively, the Directive could allow rightholders to claim restitution of the benefits appropriated by the providers (e.g. using unjust enrichment claims under national law) (see point C below).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, again, we see the general incomprehensibility of what is being pushed here. The first paragraph is an attempt to appease the platforms, basically saying &quot;if copyright holders are going to demand takedowns, they should at least be required to supply the details of what content they actually hold a copyright over.&quot; That's reasonable &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; a plan to demand mandatory filters, because the only thing such metadata is actually useful for is... a filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph is basically saying &quot;okay, yes, we mean filters for loosely defined 'high value' content, but maybe loosely defined 'low value content' doesn't require filters.&quot; Again, this appears to be an attempt to split the baby. Who the hell is going to self-describe their own content as &quot;low value content?&quot; The whole concept of &quot;high value&quot; and &quot;low value&quot; is elitist claptrap from the legacy content industries who basically believe that anything that comes from the legacy recording, TV and film studios is &quot;high value&quot; and all that independent, amateur, and user-generated content is &quot;low value.&quot; The paragraph here is &lt;strong&gt;supposed&lt;/strong&gt; to be an attempt to say &quot;well, okay, if your platform is just publishing garbage memes and stuff maybe it doesn't need a filter, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; if you happen to include any of Hollywood's precious brilliance, you must put in place a filter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third paragraph is, yet again, an attempt to give special extra rights to the legacy recording, TV, and film companies. It basically says that if platforms try to &quot;cooperate in good faith&quot; (i.e., censor at the drop of a hat) then maybe they would be considered not liable... but only if it's that riff-raff low value content that slips through the filters (though we're not demanding filters!). If any content slips through the filters that &quot;caused significant economic harm&quot; (i.e., comes from the big copyright industries), well then, it doesn't fucking matter how much you tried to stop it, you're still liable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if any internet platform makes a single mistake with Hollywood's content, no matter how hard they tried to stop it, too bad, you're liable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where there's such a massive disconnect between the framers (and supporters) of Article 13 and reality. When you're told that any mistake will lead to liability, you are put in a position of trying to prevent any mistakes. And the &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; ways to do that are to (1) stop accepting any user-uploaded content or (2) filter the hell out of all of it, and take down anything that even might possibly be considered infringing, meaning tons of perfectly legitimate content will get shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how many times these technocrats &lt;strong&gt;say&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;don't take down non-infringing works&quot;, it's totally meaningless if the only way to avoid liability is to take down tons of non-infringing works. Which brings us to the next part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non infringing content should remain online and automatic blocking to be avoided as much as possible (3+4)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content that does not infringe copyright, for example because it is covered by exceptions, should stay on the services‚Äô websites. In addition, the co-legislators could provide that minor uses of content by amateur uploaders should not be automatically blocked (in the context of the cooperation and professional diligence referred to under A) nor trigger the liability of the uploader. This should be without prejudice to the remedies under point C and the rules on liability of the providers and cooperation under A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The need to allow legitimate content to remain available, should be strengthened through a robust redress mechanism which should ensure that users can contest measures taken against their legitimate uploads. The Commission already provided possible suggestions to the co-legislators which are currently under discussions in the trilogue process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is setting up a laughable impossibility. First they say you're liable if you let anything through, and then they say &quot;but don't accidentally take down stuff you shouldn't.&quot; How the hell do you do that? The rules don't say. Hollywood and Article 13's supporters don't care. It's great if they add a &quot;redress mechanism&quot; for bogus takedowns, but that only will apply to content that first gets up and then is taken down. It says nothing for content that is blocked from being uploaded in the first place due to overaggressive filters, which are only overaggressive due to the earlier parts of Article 13 that say you're liable if you let anything &quot;high value&quot; through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ultimate in cowardice from the EU regulators. Rather than address the &lt;strong&gt;actual&lt;/strong&gt; problems that their own regulations will create, these regulators have decided to just append a bit to their regulation that says &quot;and don't let this create the problems it will obviously create.&quot; That's fucking useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rightholders should keep benefiting from existing measures; and platforms not released from liability by merely applying content identification technologies. Rightholders, notably audiovisual sector, not worse off (5+6+7)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rightholders should in any event retain the ability to request removal of infringing content from the websites of the content sharing services. Building on and complementing the current ecommerce rules, rightholders should be allowed to request that unauthorised content is expeditiously removed and that best efforts are made to ensure that it stays down. As indicated in A, the co-legislators may provide for an additional safeguard for rightholders when despite the good faith cooperation the availability of content online causes significant economic harm to them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something really big hidden in here. A &quot;notice and &lt;strong&gt;stay down&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; requirement. That was not what was being pushed before. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=notice+and+staydown&quot;&gt;Notice and staydown&lt;/a&gt; creates all sorts of problems, in that &lt;strong&gt;by its very nature&lt;/strong&gt; it obliterates the points in the previous paragraph. If you have a notice and staydown regime, you &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; allow content that is &quot;covered by exceptions&quot; because you've already designated all such content must stay down. And unless these bureaucrats in Brussels have magically invented a filter that can understand context &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; correctly judge whether or not something is covered by an exception (something that normally takes a years-long adversarial judicial process) it is difficult to see how this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5498538-SPOLITICO-18121018260-1-1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the other document&lt;/a&gt;, leaked earlier today by Politico, that attempts to wordsmith the actual language of Article 13. It's basically the same stuff we discussed above, but with an attempt to put it into actual legalese. Two things stand out in the document. First, they try to rebrand mandatory upload filters, by now discussing &quot;suitable and effective technologies&quot; to &quot;ensure the non-availability on the websites of the service providers of unauthorised works or other subject matter...&quot; How is that not a filter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document also includes some language &quot;as an option&quot; that would require &quot;best effort to prevent their future availability.&quot; That's putting the notice-and-staydown into the law. I will note that there is no real language being discussed that explains &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent the blocking of non-infringing works. Just more hand waving and magical thinking about how it shouldn't block non-infringing works... even though it absolutely will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves me with two key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bureaucrats putting this together are doing the worst kind of regulating.&lt;/strong&gt; They appear to be utterly ignorant of what it is that they are regulating, how it works, and the inevitable impact of their new rules. And, rather than trying to take the time to actually understand the concerns, they are simply writing &quot;but don't do that&quot; into the law every time someone explains the impact. But you can't regulate internet platforms not to overblock when everything else in your law requires them to overblock or face crippling liability. This is like a law that says &quot;you must immediately dump out the bathwater without looking to see what's in the bath... but don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.&quot; How do you do that? The law doesn't say because the regulators don't have the slightest clue. And they don't have the slightest clue because it's impossible. And, they don't seem to care about that because once they pass the law they can celebrate and the mess they create is left for the internet platforms (and the public) to deal with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given the massive changes and broad and unclear mandates being tossed around, Article 13 is nowhere near a condition which should be put into a binding regulation.&lt;/strong&gt; What's being debated now is so unclear, so vague and such a mess, that it would be practically criminal to put such nonsense into law. They are rushing to get this done (perhaps before the next EU Parliamentary elections next spring), and the fact that they're about to make massive changes to a fundamental part of society (the internet) without clearly comprehending what they're doing is incredibly frightening. This is like a bad first draft of a bad proposal. This is not just &quot;this is a bad bill that went through a comprehensive process and I disagree with it.&quot; This is an utter mess. It keeps shifting, it has vague and contradictory definitions, it tells companies to wave magic wands, and tells companies not to let the very thing the law compels actually happen. This is not regulating. This is why the public hates regulators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
I'm still hopeful that common sense eventually shows up in the EU, but at this point the only way for common sense to survive is to simply dump Article 13 entirely.

<title>Amazon‚Äôs Chips Threaten Intel</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/technology/amazon-server-chip-intel.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/technology/amazon-server-chip-intel.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon, the world‚Äôs largest online retailer and largest cloud-computing company, is pushing into a new line of work: computer chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Late last month, the company, based in Seattle, revealed that it had spent the last few years building a new chip for use inside the millions of servers in its data centers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon does not plan to sell this chip directly to customers, but the decision by one of the world‚Äôs biggest buyers of computer processors to go the do-it-yourself route is likely to have a major impact on Intel, the iconic Silicon Valley chip maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Intel has struggled to keep up with recent technology trends, from the increasing use of mobile devices to artificial intelligence, as influence over chip designs has been shifting to Amazon, Apple and Google, which already dominate much of the rest of the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon‚Äôs new chip arrives as market forces are rapidly undercutting chip makers and their &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-increase-12-7-percent-year-to-year-in-october-double-digit-annual-growth-projected-for-2018/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$412 billion&lt;/a&gt; in yearly sales. Online operations like Amazon and Google have grown so large, they can save significant money by making chips tailored to their needs rather than buying them from longtime suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn‚Äôt had much competition in the server market in recent years. The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Intel acknowledges that companies like Amazon want to reduce their dependency on one big chip supplier. ‚ÄúI am not unaware of the dynamic,‚Äù Lisa Spelman, an Intel vice president, said. ‚ÄúOur goal is to understand and respectfully acknowledge that desire.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;About 35 percent of the server chips sold around the world go to about 10 companies, including large internet companies like Amazon and a handful of telecommunication firms, said Shane Rau, a chip analyst with the research firm IDC. That just one of them is shifting its business is terrible news for Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúEach one of these companies is so large, they represent a market unto themselves,‚Äù Mr. Rau said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In recent years, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/technology/chips-off-the-old-block-computers-are-taking-design-cues-from-human-brains.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google has designed specialized chips&lt;/a&gt; for artificial intelligence technology. Facebook and Microsoft, which like most internet companies are major buyers of chips from Intel, have indicated that they are working on similar A.I. chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Apple beat the other tech giants to this cost-saving trend four years ago when it unveiled its first custom-built chip for the iPhone. Google and Microsoft are also building the chips that go into devices like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon has upped the ante. In 2015, it spent a reported $350 million to acquire a chip maker, Annapurna Labs, which helped build the new central processing unit, or C.P.U.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A C.P.U. ‚Äî the centerpiece of a computer‚Äôs operations ‚Äî is the sort of chip that Intel has made for decades to run personal computers and servers. Building these chips requires rare expertise and hundreds of millions of dollars in capital. It is a big step up in complexity from building chips tailored to certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThe belief was that you needed some magic to build a processor, particularly a server processor,‚Äù said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of the chip start-up Cerebras and a former executive at the chip maker AMD. ‚ÄúYou had to be Intel or AMD ‚Äî and that was about it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon executives believe the chip, which was designed to be more energy efficient, will help reduce the cost of electrical power in its data centers. It said it was offering a cloud-computing service that would allow business customers to use its new chip. The cost of the service could be 45 percent lower than other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;And when Amazon buys chips from other companies, a homegrown option gives it even more sway over prices. ‚ÄúThey can now say to Intel, ‚ÄòWe will just move the workloads to other chips,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Feldman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon has also designed a chip for artificial intelligence, called the Inferentia. In a recent &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2018/11/aws-designed-processor-graviton/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished engineer inside Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing arm, said the company would continue building new chips for artificial intelligence and other specialized tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Google has designed three generations of A.I. chips, and it has long hinted that it will eventually build a C.P.U. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not rocket science,‚Äù a Google chip specialist, Dave Patterson, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/google-artificial-intelligence-chips.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;said late last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Though it is still enormously difficult, building a chip is easier than it used to be. Amazon licensed much of the technology from ARM, the company that provides the basic technology for most smartphone chips. It made the chip through TSMC, a Taiwanese company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For Intel, Amazon‚Äôs move into C.P.U.s is a strike at a longtime strength. Intel was beaten to the smartphone and tablet market a decade ago, a significant missed opportunity. The tech industry shifted, and Intel didn‚Äôt shift with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Intel has a 96.6 percent share of server chip sales, according to IDC. It was 98.6 percent until its longtime competitor, AMD, which had stayed on the sidelines of the server business for about a decade, recently re-entered the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Intel‚Äôs profits continue to rise with the rapid expansion of the tech industry. But the financial results of its most recent quarter highlight the chip maker‚Äôs dependence on servers. Intel‚Äôs data center group, which sells both server and A.I. chips, pulled in $6.1 billion, a 26 percent increase over the previous year. The group now accounts for more than 30 percent of Intel‚Äôs revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;As the chip market has changed, Intel has tried to diversify. In recent years, it bought three companies that design chips for artificial intelligence and other types of hardware that are becoming increasingly important inside smartphones, cars and data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The competition outside of traditional server chips is extensive. In addition to Amazon, Google and Nvidia ‚Äî the dominant maker of specialty chips for tasks like A.I. ‚Äî &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/14/technology/artificial-intelligence-chip-start-ups.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;dozens of smaller companies are building A.I. chips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Through their fast-growing cloud computing services, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Google are reinventing how companies set up their computer networks. Going to a cloud service allows companies to wash their hands of acquiring and maintaining back-room computer systems ‚Äî the tech experts do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It is a lucrative business. Amazon Web Services brings in nearly $27 billion a year, and it accounts for 56 percent of Amazon‚Äôs profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Inside these cloud operations, the internet companies are also reinventing how computers are built. They are designing much of their own hardware, from the servers to the networking gear that connects servers. Facebook is doing similar work with the technology in its data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Amazon‚Äôs new chip is running only a small fraction of the software across the company‚Äôs online empire. But that is expected to expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe will look back at this as a watershed moment,‚Äù said Mr. Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google Employees Demand the End of Forced Arbitration Across the Tech Industry</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/google-employees-demand-the-end-of-forced-arbitration-across-the-tech-industry/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/google-employees-demand-the-end-of-forced-arbitration-across-the-tech-industry/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;On the heels of an employee-led¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/google-walkout-organizers-response-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;against Google, a group of 35 Google employees&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span&gt;banding together to take it a step further and end the practice of forced arbitration across the entire tech industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Forced arbitration ensures workplace disputes are settled behind closed doors and without any right to an appeal. These types of agreements effectively prevent employees from suing companies.¬†&lt;/span&gt;Following the walkout last month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/google-walkout-organizers-response-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;Google got¬†&lt;/a&gt;rid of forced arbitration for sexual harassment and sexual assault claims, offering more transparency around those investigations and more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/airbnb-ends-forced-arbitration-days-after-google-facebook-did-the-same/&quot;&gt;Airbnb, eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/airbnb-ends-forced-arbitration-days-after-google-facebook-did-the-same/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; quickly followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, optional arbitration at &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is only granted for full-time employees, which does not include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/google-contract-workers-demand-better-pay-and-benefits/&quot;&gt;thousands of contract workers at the company&lt;/a&gt;. Now, a group of Google employees is demanding an end to forced arbitration, as it relates to any case of discrimination, across the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the employees note on Medium, arbitration is still forced for discrimination cases pertaining to race, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, age and¬†ability. Additionally, employee contracts in the U.S. still have an arbitration waiver, the employees wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe have not heard of any plan to render these waivers null and void,‚Äù employees wrote on Medium. ‚ÄúGoogle operates in 52 countries where arbitration laws vary, and leadership has not addressed these variances. What should we expect?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, they‚Äôre asking other tech workers to join them in their fight to end forced arbitration for all forms of harassment and discrimination. They‚Äôre also calling on elected officials to support the Arbitration Fairness Act, as well as Restoring Justice for Workers Act.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IPFS, The Interplanetary File System, Simply Explained</title>
<link>https://achainofblocks.com/2018/10/05/ipfs-interplanetary-file-system-simply-explained/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://achainofblocks.com/2018/10/05/ipfs-interplanetary-file-system-simply-explained/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Internet is the most important tool in our everyday lives. It‚Äôs how we consume media, conversate with friends and family, interact with colleagues, learn new skills, and handle our finances. However, the internet that we know and love has flaws. The biggest of those flaws is that the information on it is mostly centralized. This means that the information we access every day is held on servers that are under the control of a central company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Interplanetary File System Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has a goal to create a distributed Web. A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2 ‚ÄòCentral‚Äô Problems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centralization poses a couple of main issues. The first is when you have a central company that controls a lot of data, what happens if access to those servers is not possible? A central company that controls servers that store a lot of valuable and useful data becomes a single point of failure. This failure could be due to an attack, or something as simple as a server that is offline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second issue with storing data in a central location is censorship. When large majorities of data are hosted on a few main servers it is easier for Governments to block access to them. In 2017, residents of Turkey were blocked from accessing Wikipedia.com. The Turkish government banned the website calling it, ‚ÄúA National Security Threat‚Äù. This also happened in Egypt in January 2011, when the Government cut off Internet and Cell Phone access for over 95% of its citizens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why Do We Use a Flawed System?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real reason we continue to accept this model is that we have become spoiled with regard to our internet access. We want web pages to load in milliseconds, images and videos to appear without lag, and of course, this all has to be in the highest HD or 4K quality. Centralizing servers gives companies complete control over how fast they can deliver this content, and charge accordingly for it. Another reason that we continue with this method is that there really is not a good alternative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;IPFS ‚Üí The Good Alternative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The InterPlanetary File System (also known as IPFS), is an idea to make the Internet completely distributed. The concept transforms the traditional ‚ÄòHTTP‚Äô internet into a Peer to Peer network, similar to how BitTorrent works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Juan Benet is the creator of IPFS and the Founder of Protocol Labs. ¬†Protocol Labs is a tech research and development lab that is responsible for IPFS, they have also developed Filecoin &amp;amp; IPLD (and others). Benet studied Computer Science at Stanford University and is pretty much obsessed with anything to do with Knowledge, Science, and Technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs-simply-explained-file-coin-bitcoin-juan-benet.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-3770&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs-simply-explained-file-coin-bitcoin-juan-benet.png&quot; alt=&quot;interplanetary file system ipfs simply explained file coin bitcoin juan benet&quot; width=&quot;214&quot; height=&quot;245&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Juan Benets‚Äô original goal was not to necessarily create IPFS when he crafted the concept. What he was looking to do was find an efficient way to move scientific data sets, meaning data that could be 10-100+ GB in size. IPFS was designed to look like what would happen if Git and BitTorrent had a baby together. BitTorrent gives you the ability to move large files across a network rather quickly, and Git gives you the built-in versioning for data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After creating this protocol, Benet soon realized that the implications were much larger than just moving large data sets. He had actually created a protocol which could replace other popular protocols in place for how we access information via the web today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Where did the name InterPlanetary File System Come From?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When they came up with the naming of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the idea was to pay a bit of an homage to how the Internet got its name. JCR Licklider, who is the creator of the Arpanet (the predecessor to the internet), had a goal to create an Intergalactic Network. Thus the Internet is really short for Intergalactic Network. InterPlanetary takes a little bit of that same naming convention, additionally, IPFS aims to be the File System (FS) for Internet Protocol (IP). When you put them together you have IPFS, the internet file system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will dive into and explain how IPFS works as a filing system. But first, it is important to understand how we access files from the web today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you want to download an image from the internet you tell your computer exactly where to find the image that you are requesting. This location is normally in the form of a URL that contains the domain name of the company that is storing the photo, this is followed by an extension that specifies what the file is. An example request for this blog post would look like this: https://achainofblocks.com/ipfs-simple-guide.jpg. This method for accessing resources is called ‚ÄúLocation Based Addressing‚Äù, you tell the computer the Location where they can Access the information and the computer retrieves the information. The one problem with this method is if the location is not accessible (maybe the server is offline) then the users‚Äô computer cannot retrieve the information that they need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-3755&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP-300x120.png&quot; alt=&quot;InterPlanetary File System IPFS Location Based Addressing HTTP&quot; width=&quot;390&quot; height=&quot;156&quot; srcset=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP-300x120.png 300w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP-768x307.png 768w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP-1024x409.png 1024w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP-370x148.png 370w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP-760x303.png 760w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Location-Based-Addressing-HTTP-600x240.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Server Down, We‚Äôre All Down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With location-based addressing when a server goes down, everything contained within that server is not accessible over the internet. However, when a server goes down there is a high probability that another user has downloaded that image, and is storing it locally on their computer. But even if another computer does have this file, your computer is not able to connect with the other computer in possession to transport the file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All About the Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help address this issue, IPFS introduces the concept of ‚ÄúContent-Based Addressing‚Äù. With content-based addressing when requesting a specific resource you do not need to specify the location, you only need to specify what you want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every file has a unique hash, which can be thought of as the fingerprint or identification of the file. When you want to access a specific file, you simply ask the network who has a copy of the file with the specified hash. Once the request is made, someone on the IPFS network will provide the resource that you have requested. You will download that resource, and a copy will be saved to you IPFS cache. Now when another person comes and requests the same file, you will be able to provide it to them. This creates a system that speeds as it is used more because the more files that are shared the more readily available they are amongst a large group of nodes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Change is Good‚Ä¶&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point, my guess is that you have the same question I did right about now. How do I know that the person or node that is providing me with the file hasn‚Äôt tampered with it in some way? Because you use a hash function to retrieve the file, you can verify what you have received. Changing the hash of a file would be equally as difficult as changing a transaction in the blockchain. A request is made for a file that has a specific hash, so when the file is received you make sure that the hash matches the request. This is the same method you would use for validating your Amazon purchase. If you ordered Green Socks, and Red Socks show up you would reject them and wait for your Green Socks to show up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another feature of IPFS is deduplication, this means when multiple users post the same file it is only created one time on the network. This is something that helps to make the network more efficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How IPFS Really Works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now you have the basics of how IPFS compares to today‚Äôs traditional methods, let‚Äôs dive a little deeper into how IPFS actually stores data and makes it accessible to users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In IPFS, files are stored in IPFS objects, and each Object can store 256 kb of data. An Object can also contain a Link to another IPFS object, linking is what makes it possible to store data that is larger than 256 kb. For example, if you upload just a small text file, then one 256 kb object should be adequate for your small amount of text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3756&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-300x188.png&quot; alt=&quot;InterPlanetary File System IPFS Content Based Addressing Data object&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; srcset=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-300x188.png 300w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-370x232.png 370w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, if you are storing a picture, this would be broken up into multiple objects that are each a maximum of 256 kb. The IPFS system will then create an Empty Object that would link to all the objects that make up that picture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-3757&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG-300x193.png&quot; alt=&quot;InterPlanetary File System IPFS Content Based Addressing Data object JPG&quot; width=&quot;536&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; srcset=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG-300x193.png 300w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG-768x494.png 768w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG-1024x658.png 1024w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG-370x238.png 370w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG-760x488.png 760w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-JPG-600x386.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This architecture is very simple, but it is also very powerful, the architecture is what truly enables IPFS to be used as a file system. If you take a look at the simple file directory structure below, I‚Äôll explain how this could be translated to an IPFS structure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Interplanetary-File-System-IPFS-Simple-File-Structure.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3759 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Interplanetary-File-System-IPFS-Simple-File-Structure-300x293.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interplanetary File System IPFS Simple File Structure&quot; width=&quot;360&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; srcset=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Interplanetary-File-System-IPFS-Simple-File-Structure-300x293.png 300w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Interplanetary-File-System-IPFS-Simple-File-Structure-370x361.png 370w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Interplanetary-File-System-IPFS-Simple-File-Structure.png 760w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Interplanetary-File-System-IPFS-Simple-File-Structure-600x585.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;slegx5c063ab11f58d&quot;&gt;
&lt;div/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could be translated to IPFS by creating 1 Object for each File and each Folder/Directory, then link the files to the specified directories. However, it gets even better when you take into account the fact that IPFS uses Content-Based Addressing. This means that files that are added are immutable, they can never be changed, very much like a blockchain. This means you can be assured that the resource you are accessing is the correct data, and has never been altered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-3761&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System-300x214.png&quot; alt=&quot;InterPlanetary File System IPFS Content Based Addressing Data object File System&quot; width=&quot;470&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; srcset=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System-300x214.png 300w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System-768x548.png 768w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System-1024x730.png 1024w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System-370x264.png 370w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System-760x542.png 760w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-File-System-600x428.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;How Can I Update My Data?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IPFS supports file Versioning, this works similarly to how Git works as an open source code repository. For example, you are working on a text file called, ‚ÄòImportant Document ‚Äì v1.doc‚Äô, and you want to share this document with people using IFPS. When you add this file to IPFS, what happens behind the scenes is, IPFS will create a new Commit Object. This Object is very basic, all it does is tell IPFS which Commit preceded this one and it links to the IPFS Object associated with the File, ‚ÄòImportant Document ‚Äì v1.doc‚Äô.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-commit-object.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3763&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-commit-object-207x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;InterPlanetary File System IPFS Content Based Addressing Data object commit object&quot; width=&quot;207&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-commit-object-207x300.png 207w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-commit-object-370x537.png 370w, https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/InterPlanetary-File-System-IPFS-Content-Based-Addressing-Data-object-commit-object.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now let‚Äôs imagine some time has gone by and your ‚ÄòImportant Document.doc‚Äô needs a revision. This is done by simply adding the new file to IPFS ‚ÄòImportant Document ‚Äì v2.doc‚Äô, the software will create a new Commit Object for the updated file (same as the original process). This Commit Object now links to the previous Committed Object, the first Commit serving as the Parent Object. This process can be repeated endlessly, creating a linked chain of versions of the same data all referencing the entire chain. IPFS makes sure that your file along with the entire file versioning history is accessible to all other nodes on the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No System is Perfect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far we have discussed many of the useful features and key concepts of the InterPlanetary File System. However, all protocols have limitation and drawbacks. As you might imagine, the biggest problem that IPFS currently faces is keeping the files available. Every node on the network keeps a cache of the files that they have downloaded and helps to make them available as other users need them. However, in a simple situation, if a Document is hosted by 4 nodes and they all go offline that document is no longer accessible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a couple of ways to tackle the problem above. One way is to incentivize nodes to stay online and keep the files available to the community. A reward for storage space that you can commit to the network, this would ensure that files have a high likelihood of being available when needed. The other way is to proactively distribute files throughout the network, making sure there are always enough copies online at any given time. You can think of this like redundancy on a massive scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Filecoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This issue is the exact issue that Filecoin is aiming to solve. Filecoin was created by the same group that founded IPFS. Filecoin is a blockchain that is built on top of IPFS with the goal of creating a decentralized market for storage. What that means is that users that have extra storage available on their hard drive can rent it out for use as IPFS storage and make some money off it in the process. You can think of Filecoin as a similar service to Airbnb, instead of renting out the available space in your house, you rent out the space available on your computer for storage. Filecoin creates an incentive for nodes to keep the data online and retain for as long as possible. In addition to an incentive, which keeps the nodes online, it also replicates the data across many nodes making it highly available and easily accessible (even if a few nodes are offline). Filecoin and IPFS have the same goal and that is to be Offline First, meaning they are constantly striving to make a better experience without needing to make a call to a server to access resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a very high-level quick summary of Filecoin. I will go deeper into Filecoin, along with some of the other great projects from Protocol labs in future articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs-filecoin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3766&quot; src=&quot;https://achainofblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs-filecoin-300x200.png&quot; alt=&quot;interplanetary file system ipfs filecoin&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipld.io&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://ipld.io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;‚ÄúIPLD is the data model of the content-addressable web. It allows us to treat all hash-linked data structures as subsets of a unified information space, unifying all data models that link data with hashes as instances of IPLD.‚Äù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this means is that IPLD aims to be a data model for interoperable protocols. There are many use cases for this type of technology. This gives the ability to have Smart Contracts that run on IPFS. The point is that IPLD provides libraries that make the underlying data interoperable across tools and across protocols.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;IPLD and Filecoin are both very involved projects that will require their own dedicated articles to fully understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additional Thoughts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope it is obvious from reading this article that the IPFS is a very ambitious project. The majority of early projects with a focus on decentralization have been largely about the currency and financial aspect. IPFS is really about building a better way to share data. There have been challenges to HTTP before. However, IPFS is clearly the most established and regarded as a system that could see mass adoption in the coming years. By no means am I insinuating that HTTP is going away, Juan Benet himself admits that HTTP is a great protocol that is still very useful. However, it is a protocol that is over 25 years old, and as IPFS continues to grow in adoption the use cases will expand along with the technology. It is very likely that we will have a situation where we are using both protocols together until IPFS eventually takes over. Very similar to how we still use FTP today in much more specific capacity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the time of writing this article:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bitcoin = $6,500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ethereum = $220&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Filecoin = $5.15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bitcoin Dominance = 52.1%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google will shut down Google+ four months early after second data leak</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134541/google-plus-privacy-api-data-leak-developers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134541/google-plus-privacy-api-data-leak-developers</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;AHrEff&quot;&gt;Google+ has suffered another data leak, and Google has decided to shut down the consumer version of the social network &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951890/google-plus-shut-down-security-api-change-gmail-android&quot;&gt;four months earlier than it originally planned&lt;/a&gt;. Google+ will now close to consumers in April, rather than August. Additionally, API access to the network will shut down within the next 90 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nGc2Oq&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/&quot;&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, the new vulnerability impacted 52.5 million users, who could have had profile information like their name, email address, occupation, and age exposed to developers, even if their account was set to private. Apps could also access profile data that had been shared with a specific user, but was not shared publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;icHFNz&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;‚ÄúWith the discovery of this new bug, we have decided to expedite the shut-down of all Google+ APIs.‚Äù&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5Cqilu&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951914/google-plus-data-breach-exposed-user-profile-information-privacy-not-disclosed&quot;&gt;In October&lt;/a&gt;, a similar Google+ vulnerability was revealed to have exposed private user data to developers for as long as three years. The bug was first discovered in March, but not publicly disclosed until October, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17957312/google-plus-vulnerability-privacy-breach-law&quot;&gt;significant transparency concerns&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Google announced plans to shut down the consumer version of Google+, which had long struggled to attract users. This time around, Google says it discovered the leak on its own and it was live for just six days ‚Äî between November 7th and November 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RER0Cx&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWith the discovery of this new bug, we have decided to expedite the shut-down of all Google+ APIs; this will occur within the next 90 days,‚Äù reads the blog post, penned by David Thacker, Google‚Äôs vice president of project management. ‚ÄúIn addition, we have also decided to accelerate the sunsetting of consumer Google+ from August 2019 to April 2019. While we recognize there are implications for developers, we want to ensure the protection of our users.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PjvWGY&quot;&gt;Google discovered the bug as part of its standard testing procedure and says there is ‚Äúno evidence that the app developers that inadvertently had this access for six days were aware of it or misused.‚Äù Google says it‚Äôs begun notifying users and enterprise customers who were impacted by the bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DbgQrc&quot;&gt;‚ÄúWe understand that our ability to build reliable products that protect your data drives user trust,‚Äù Thacker wrote. ‚ÄúWe have always taken this seriously, and we continue to invest in our privacy programs.‚Äù Google still plans to continue operating Google+ as an enterprise product for companies that subscribe to its G Suite service.&lt;/p&gt;
