<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;35.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-type=&quot;sourceText&quot;&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;On an early spring day in 2018, the faint smell of formaldehyde floating in the air, 26-year-old medical student Warren Nielsen and four of his classmates prepped a cadaver in the chilly dissection lab at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar groups of five gathered around bodies on the other 15 tables in the anatomy class, all eager to explore the mysteries of the human body they had seen only in textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cadaver assigned to Nielsen's team was a 99-year-old woman who had died of natural causes. Her name was Rose Marie Bentley, but the students didn't know that then. To honor and respect the privacy of those who offer their bodies to science, no further details are given medical students about the person who had once inhabited the body lying on the silvery slab before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ImageCaptionWrapper&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rose Marie Bentley, not long before she died and donated her body to science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the students and their professors were soon to find out, Bentley was special, so special she deserved her own unique spot in medical literature and history books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason? A condition called situs inversus with levocardia, in which most vital organs are reversed -- almost like a mirror inside the body. That, along with a host of other weird but wonderful abnormalities, made Bentley a sort of medical unicorn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Spaced Repetition</title>
<link>https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When should one review? In the morning? In the evening? Any old time? The studies demonstrating the spacing effect do not control or vary the time of day, so in one sense, the answer is: it doesn’t matter - if it did matter, there would be considerable variance in how effective the effect is based on when a particular study had its subjects do their reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So one reviews at whatever time is convenient. Convenience makes one more likely to stick with it, and sticking with it overpowers any temporary improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one is not satisfied with that answer, then on general considerations, one ought to review before bedtime &amp;amp; sleep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory%20consolidation%23Spacing%20effect&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Memory consolidation#Spacing effect&quot;&gt;Memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt; seems to be related, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep%20and%20memory&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Sleep and memory&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; is known to powerfully influence what memories enter long-term memory, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033079&quot; title=&quot;Memory for Semantically Related and Unrelated Declarative Information: The Benefit of Sleep, the Cost of Wake&quot;&gt;strengthening memories&lt;/a&gt; of material learned close to bedtime and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/106/25/10130.full&quot; title=&quot;'REM, not incubation, improves creativity by priming associative networks', Cai et al 2009&quot;&gt;increasing creativity&lt;/a&gt;; interrupting sleep without affecting total sleep time or quality still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/07/20/1015633108&quot;&gt;damages memory formation in mice&lt;/a&gt;. So reviewing before bedtime would be best. (Other mental exercises show improvement when trained before bedtime; for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/DNB-FAQ#sleep&quot;&gt;dual n-back&lt;/a&gt;.) One possible mechanism is that it may be that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/5/1563.full&quot; title=&quot;Sleep Selectively Enhances Memory Expected to Be of Future Relevance&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;expectancy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of future reviews/tests is enough to encourage memory consolidation during sleep; so if one reviews and goes to bed, presumably the expectancy is stronger than if one reviewed at breakfast and had an eventful day and forgot entirely about the reviewed flashcards. (See also the correlation between time of studying &amp;amp; GPA in Hartwig &amp;amp; Dunlosky 2012.) Neural growth may be related; from Stahl 2010:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology underlying normal human memory formation have revealed that learning is not an event, but rather a process that unfolds over time.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876761/&quot; title=&quot;'Neurogenesis and the spacing effect: Learning over time enhances memory and the survival of new neurons', Sisti et al 2007&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650827/&quot; title=&quot;'Reconsolidation: maintaining memory relevance', Lee 2009&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/2010-oneill.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Play it again: reactivation of waking experience and memory', O'Neill et al 2010&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;,[Squire 2003 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fundamental-Neuroscience-Second-Larry-Squire/dp/0126603030/?tag=gwernnet-20&quot;&gt;Fundamental Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;],&lt;a href=&quot;http://davidjf.free.fr/new/Xtech_scientific%20american_%20making%20memories%20stick.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Making Memories Stick', Fields 2005, Scientific American&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, it is not surprising that learning strategies that repeat materials over time enhance their retention.&lt;sup&gt;20,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1980-glenberg.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Spacing repetitions over 1 week', Glenberg &amp;amp; Lehmann 1980&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1991-toppino.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The effect of spacing repetitions on the recognition memory of young children and adults', Toppino et al 1991&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/1978-landauer.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Optimum rehearsal patterns and name learning', Landauer &amp;amp; Bjork 1978&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsu.edu/~fournier/Teaching/psych592/Readings/Karpicke_et_al_2008.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning', Karpicke &amp;amp; Roediger 2008&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6698/bf91c9333faa0d333a800254b8063230d4f4.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Optimizing retrieval as a learning event: When and why expanding retrieval practice enhances long-term retention', Storm et al 2010&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pashler.com/Articles/Pashler.Rohrer.Cepeda.Carpenter_2007.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Enhancing learning and retarding forgetting: Choices and consequences', Pashler et al 2007&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Thousands of new cells are generated in this region every day, although many of these cells die within weeks of their creation.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/45c2/7c08fbb43f8728e69a7447366d4a4f74e088.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Adult neurogenesis produces a large pool of new granule cells in the dentate gyrus', Cameron &amp;amp; McKay 2001&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The survival of dentate gyrus neurons has been shown to be enhanced in animals when they are placed into learning situations.&lt;sup&gt;16-20&lt;/sup&gt; Animals that learn well retain more dentate gyrus neurons than do animals that do not learn well. Furthermore, 2 weeks after testing, animals trained in discrete spaced intervals over a period of time, rather than in a single presentation or a ‘massed trial’ of the same information, remember better.&lt;sup&gt;16-20&lt;/sup&gt; The precise mechanism that links neuronal survival with learning has not yet been identified. One theory is that the hippocampal neurons that preferentially survive are the ones that are somehow activated during the learning process.&lt;sup&gt;16-20&lt;/sup&gt; The distribution of learning over a period of time may be more effective in encouraging neuronal survival by allowing more time for changes in gene expression and protein synthesis that extend the life of neurons that are engaged in the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Transferring memory from the encoding stage, which occurs during alert wakefulness, into consolidation must thus occur at a time when interference from ongoing new memory formation is reduced.&lt;sup&gt;17,18&lt;/sup&gt; One such time for this transfer is during sleep, especially during non-rapid eye movement sleep, when the hippocampus can communicate with other brain areas without interference from new experiences.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d0a7/f06ed267f3193daab1175a65abb7a067bef4.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'Sleep, Learning, and Dreams: Off-line Memory Reprocessing', Stickgold et al 2001&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/77fd/0cf03de8a6c4f56c5decc7c47ebe69cf98c1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The contribution of sleep to hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation', Marshall &amp;amp; Born 2007&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/docs/spacedrepetition/2001-maquet.pdf&quot; title=&quot;'The Role of Sleep in Learning and Memory', Maquet et al 2001&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe that is why some decisions are better made after a good night’s rest and also why pulling an all-nighter, studying with sleep deprivation, may allow you to pass an exam an hour later but not remember the material a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;prospects-extended-flashcards&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#prospects-extended-flashcards&quot; title=&quot;Link to section: 'Prospects: extended flashcards'&quot;&gt;Prospects: extended flashcards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back for a moment. What are all our flashcards, small and large, doing for us? Why do I have a pair of flashcards for the word ‘anent’ among many others? I can just look it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look ups take time compared to already knowing something. (Let’s ignore the previously discussed 5 minute rule.) If we think about this abstractly in a computer science context, we might recognize it as an old concept in algorithms &amp;amp; optimization discussions - the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space-time%20tradeoff&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: space-time tradeoff&quot;&gt;space-time tradeoff&lt;/a&gt;. We trade off lookup time against limited skull space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the sort of factual data already given as examples - we might one day need to know the average annual rainfall in Honolulu or Austin, but it would require too much space to memorize such data for all capitals. There are millions of English words, but in practice any more than 100,000 is excessive. More surprising is a sort of procedural knowledge. An extreme form of space-time tradeoffs in computers is when a computation is replaced by pre-calculated constants. We could take a math &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function%20%28mathematics%29&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Function (mathematics)&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; and calculate its output for each possible input. Usually such a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lookup%20table&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: lookup table&quot;&gt;lookup table&lt;/a&gt; of input to output is really large. Think about how many entries would be in such a table for all possible integer multiplications between 1 and 1 billion. But sometimes the table is really small (like binary Boolean functions) or small (like trigonometric tables) or large but still useful (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainbow%20table&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: rainbow table&quot;&gt;rainbow table&lt;/a&gt;s usually start in the gigabytes and easily reach terabytes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given an infinitely large lookup table, we could replace &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; the skill of, say, addition or multiplication by the lookup table. No computation. The space-time tradeoff taken to the extreme of the space side of the continuum. (We could go the other way and define multiplication or addition as the slow computation which doesn’t know any specifics like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiplication%20table&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: multiplication table&quot;&gt;multiplication table&lt;/a&gt; - as if every time you wanted to add &lt;span class=&quot;mjpage&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-chtml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-math&quot; aria-label=&quot;Equation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-semantics&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mrow&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mn&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mo MJXc-space2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-mn MJXc-space2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; you had to count on 4 fingers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So suppose we were children who wanted to learn multiplication. SRS and Mnemosyne can’t help because multiplication is not a specific factoid? The space-time tradeoff shows us that we can de-proceduralize multiplication and turn it partly into factoids. It wouldn’t be hard for us to write a quick script or macro to generate, say, 500 random cards which ask us to multiply AB by XY, and import them to Mnemosyne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, which is your mind going to do - get good at multiplying 2 numbers (generate on-demand), or memorize 500 different multiplication problems (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memoize&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: memoize&quot;&gt;memoize&lt;/a&gt;)? From my experience with multiple subtle variants on a card, the mind gives up after just a few and falls back on a problem-solving approach - which is exactly what one wants to exercise, in this case. Congratulations; you have done the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a software engineering point of view, we might want to modify or improve the cards, and 500 snippets of text would be a tad hard to update. So coolest would be a ‘dynamic card’. Add a markup type like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;eval src=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; , and then Mnemosyne feeds the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; argument straight into the Python interpreter, which returns a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuple&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: tuple&quot;&gt;tuple&lt;/a&gt; of the question text and the answer text. The question text is displayed to the user as usual, the user thinks, requests the answer, and grades himself. In Anki, Javascript is supported directly by the application in HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags (currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#_javascript&quot;&gt;inline only&lt;/a&gt; but Anki could presumably import libraries by default), for example for kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ojisanseiuchi.com/2016/03/12/JavaScript-in-Anki-cards/&quot; title=&quot;Javascript in Anki cards&quot;&gt;syntax highlighting&lt;/a&gt;, so any kind of dynamic card could be written that one wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for multiplication, the dynamic card would get 2 random integers, print a question like &lt;code&gt;x * y = ?&lt;/code&gt; and then print the result as the answer. Every so often you would get a new multiplication question, and as you get better at multiplication, you see it less often - exactly as you should. Still in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/hvqzd/printable_math_flashcards_in_pdf_and_latex_source/c1yror5&quot;&gt;math vein&lt;/a&gt;, you could generate variants on formulas or programs where one version is the correct one and the others are subtly wrong; I do this by hand with my programming flashcards (especially if I make an error doing exercises, that signals a finer point to make several flashcards on), but it can be done automatically. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/64k/memory_spaced_repetition_and_life/4e5n&quot;&gt;kpreid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/lw/64k/memory_spaced_repetition_and_life/4e5n&quot;&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; one tool of his:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.4985337243402&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kpreid/mathquiz/&quot;&gt;a program&lt;/a&gt; (in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://kpreid.github.com/mathquiz/mathquiz.html&quot;&gt;a web page&lt;/a&gt;) which does a specialized form of this [generating ‘damaged formulas’]. It has a set of generators of formulas and damaged formulas, and presents you with a list containing several formulas of the same type (e.g. ∫ 2x dx = x^2 + C) but with one damaged (e.g. ∫ 2x dx = 2x^2 + C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach generalizes to anything you can generate random problems of or have large databases of examples of. Khan Academy apparently does something like this in associating large numbers of (algorithmicly-generated?) problems with each of its little modules and tracking retention of the skill in order to decide when to do further review of that module. For example, maybe you are studying Go and are interested in learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life%20and%20death&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Life and death&quot;&gt;life-and-death positions&lt;/a&gt;. Those are things that can be generated by computer Go programs, or fetched from places like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goproblems.com&quot;&gt;GoProblems.com&lt;/a&gt;. For even more examples, Go is rotationally invariant - the best move remains the same regardless of which way the board is oriented and since there is no canonical direction for the board (like in chess) a good player ought to be able to play the same no matter how the board looks - so each specific example can be mirrored in 3 other ways. Or one could test one’s ability to ‘read’ a board by writing a dynamic card which takes each example board/problem and adds some random pieces as long as some go-playing program like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%20Go&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: GNU Go&quot;&gt;GNU Go&lt;/a&gt; says the best move hasn’t changed because of the added noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could learn an awful lot of things this way. Programming languages could be learned this way - someone learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell%20%28programming%20language%29&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Haskell (programming language)&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt; could take all the functions listed in the Prelude or his Haskell textbook, and ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: QuickCheck&quot;&gt;QuickCheck&lt;/a&gt; to generate random arguments for the functions and ask the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow%20Haskell%20Compiler&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: Glasgow Haskell Compiler&quot;&gt;GHC&lt;/a&gt; interpreter &lt;code&gt;ghci&lt;/code&gt; what the function and its arguments evaluate to. Games other than go, like chess, may work (a live example being &lt;a href=&quot;http://chesstempo.com/user-guide/en/probSearchSpacedRepetition.html&quot;&gt;Chess Tempo&lt;/a&gt;, and see the experience of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfan.org/blog/2013/07/07/mnemosyne-part-3/&quot; title=&quot;I'll mostly discuss my experience using it for chess, since that's what the majority of my 8000 cards are...&quot;&gt;Dan Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;). A fair bit of mathematics. If the dynamic card has Internet access, it can pull down fresh questions from an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS%20feed&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia: RSS feed&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; or just a website; this functionality could be quite useful in a foreign language learning context with every day bringing a fresh sentence to translate or another exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some NLP software, one could write dynamic flashcards which test all sorts of things: if one confuses verbs, the program could take a template like “$PRONOUN $VERB $PARTICLE $OBJECT % {right: caresse, wrong: caresses}” which yields flashcards like “Je caresses le chat” or “Tu caresse le chat” and one would have to decide whether it was the correct conjugation. (The dynamicism here would help prevent memorizing specific sentences rather than the underlying conjugation.) In full generality, this would probably be difficult, but simpler approaches like templates may work well enough. Jack Kinsella:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish there were dynamic SRS decks for language learning (or other disciplines). Such decks would count the number of times you have reviewed an instance of an underlying grammatical rule or an instance of a particular piece of vocabulary, for example its singular/plural/third person conjugation/dative form. These sophisticated decks would present users with fresh example sentences on every review, thereby preventing users from remembering specific answers and compelling them to learn the process of applying the grammatical rule afresh. Moreover, these decks would keep users entertained through novelty and would present users with tacit learning opportunities through rotating vocabulary used in non-essential parts of the example sentence. Such a system, with multiple-level review rotation, would not only prevent against overfit learning, but also increase the total amount of knowledge learned per minute, an efficiency I’d gladly invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these things seem like ‘skills’ and not ‘data’!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: ZFS Implementation in Python</title>
<link>https://github.com/alcarithemad/zfsp</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/alcarithemad/zfsp</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZFS, in Python, without reading the original C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many hours spent staring at hexdumps, and asking friends to search the internet for explanations of various features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like it might be a fun project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pipfile lists the dependencies; there aren't many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3.5+ is required, but 3.6 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, as PyPy runs this code much, much faster (around 4x on the test suite) and didn't support 3.6 until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pipenv install -e .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.B.: &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; gets you an &quot;editable&quot; install; changes to the source tree will affect the installed package's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test Suite.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the test suite requires one-time access to a system with ZFS, to generate the test pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;tests/fixtures.sh&lt;/code&gt; on such a system and make the resulting directory &lt;code&gt;tests/fixtures&lt;/code&gt; (this is where it will end up if you run &lt;code&gt;fixtures.sh&lt;/code&gt; directly from the &lt;code&gt;tests&lt;/code&gt; directory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests themselves can be run with &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;. Most of the tests pass, but there are some known failures. Feel free to try fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests are heavily parameterized and attempt to run all tests against all relevant pool variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zexplore&lt;/code&gt; is the main command line interface. It's reasonably well documented (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a subcommand for some limited FUSE support, which depends on &lt;code&gt;fusepy&lt;/code&gt; (developed with &lt;code&gt;2.0.4&lt;/code&gt;). This is not installed by default in the Pipfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ zexplore label -p tests/fixtures/feature_large_blocks
{b'errata': 0,
 b'features_for_read': {},

$ zexplore objset -p tests/fixtures/nested_datasets -P 1
{'config': 27,
 'creation_version': 5000,
 'deflate': 1,
 'feature_descriptions': 30,
 'features_for_read': 28,
 'features_for_write': 29,
 'free_bpobj': 11,
 'history': 32,
 'root_dataset': 2,
 'sync_bplist': 31}

$ zexplore ls -p tests/fixtures/nested_datasets /n1/n2/n3

y

$ zexplore cat -p tests/fixtures/nested_datasets /gzip-9/gzip-9 | head -n 5
A
a
aa
aal
aalii
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things won't work, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;raidz with more than 4 disks will probably fail with an inscrutable error. ZFS uses a magic allocation function that's a non-linear black box. I haven't figured it out. raidz where the disks are larger than a few GB will probably also fail, but I haven't tested that at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new feature flags have come out since I last worked on this seriously, and those features are (obviously) not supported. That's things like (incomplete list):
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SHA-512/256&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spacemap_v2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some feature flags that did exist when I was actively working on this are not implemented, either because I failed to figure out how they work, or because I didn't get around to trying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pyndata is the struct description library used to read all the on-disk structures. I wrote it first, and it's bad. If I was doing this again today, I'd probably build something with dataclasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alcarithemad/rlzjb&quot;&gt;Rust implementation of LZJB&lt;/a&gt; which is not currently included, but decompression is not the bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Update Regarding Add-Ons in Firefox</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Updated: 00:54 EDT May 5 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updates:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some users are reporting that they do not have the “hotfix-update-xpi-signing-intermediate-bug-1548973” study active in “about:studies”. Rather than using work-arounds, which can lead to issues later on, we strongly recommend that you continue to wait. If it’s possible for you to receive the hotfix, you should get it by 6am EDT, 24 hours after it was first released. For everyone else, we are working to ship a more permanent solution. (May 5, 00:54 EDT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a number of work-arounds being discussed in the community. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are not recommended as they may conflict with fixes we are deploying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll let you know when further updates are available that we recommend, and appreciate your patience. (May 4, 15:01 EDT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporarily disabled commenting on this post given volume and duplication. They’ll be re-enabled as more updates become available. (May 4, 13:02 EDT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the post to clarify that deleting extensions can result in data loss, and should not be used to attempt a fix. (May 4, 12:58 EDT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified that the study may appear in either the &lt;em&gt;Active studies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Completed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;studies&lt;/em&gt; of “about:studies” (May 4, 12:10 EDT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re aware that some users are reporting that their extensions remain disabled with both studies active. We’re tracking this issue on Bugzilla in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1549078&quot;&gt;bug 1549078&lt;/a&gt;. (May 4, 12:03 EDT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified that the Studies fix applies only to Desktop users of Firefox distributed by Mozilla. Firefox ESR, Firefox for Android, and some versions of Firefox included with Linux distributions will require separate updates. (May 4, 12:03 EDT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Friday May 3rd, we became aware of an issue with Firefox that prevented existing and new add-ons from running or being installed. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to people who use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team has identified and rolled-out a fix for all Firefox Desktop users on Release, Beta and Nightly. The fix will be automatically applied in the background within the next few hours. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/05/04/update-regarding-add-ons-in-firefox/#workarounds&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No active steps need to be taken to make add-ons work again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In particular, please do not delete and/or re-install any add-ons as an attempt to fix the issue. Deleting an add-on removes any data associated with it, where disabling and re-enabling does not.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; The fix does not apply to Firefox ESR or Firefox for Android. We’re working on releasing a fix for both, and will provide updates here and on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide this fix on short notice, we are using the Studies system. This system is enabled by default, and no action is needed &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; Studies have been disabled. Firefox users can check if they have Studies enabled by going to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firefox Options/Preferences -&amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp; Security -&amp;gt; Allow Firefox to install and run studies (scroll down to find the setting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-8663&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1363&quot; height=&quot;857&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs.png 1363w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs-252x158.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs-768x483.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_prefs-600x377.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1363px) 100vw, 1363px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Studies can be disabled again after the add-ons have been re-enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may take up to six hours for the Study to be applied to Firefox. To check if the fix has been applied, you can enter “about:studies” in the location bar. If the fix is in the active, you’ll see “hotfix-update-xpi-signing-intermediate-bug-1548973” in either the &lt;em&gt;Active studies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Completed studies&lt;/em&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-8664&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1064&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies.png 1064w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies-252x161.png 252w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies-768x491.png 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2019/05/about_studies-600x383.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1064px) 100vw, 1064px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also see “hotfix-reset-xpi-verification-timestamp-1548973” listed, which is part of the fix and may be in the &lt;em&gt;Active studies&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Completed studies&lt;/em&gt; section(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a general fix that doesn’t use the Studies system and will keep this blog post updated accordingly. We will share a more substantial update in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional sources of information:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I&amp;#039;m not collaborating with Kenneth Reitz</title>
<link>https://vorpus.org/blog/why-im-not-collaborating-with-kenneth-reitz/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://vorpus.org/blog/why-im-not-collaborating-with-kenneth-reitz/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;[Content Warning: parts of this post could be triggering for those who have experienced gaslighting or other forms of abuse]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Reitz is a famous Python developer, best-known for founding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/requests/&quot;&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; project. Until a few years ago, I'd never interacted with him in any serious way, but I thought highly of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciated (and still appreciate) his design taste, and emphasis on usability and beauty. Requests is a piece of critical infrastructure that holds up large parts of the software world; his puckish insistence that it's actually an &quot;art project&quot; appealed to my anarchist sympathies. I admired (and still admire) his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/mentalhealtherror-an-exception-occurred&quot;&gt;openness with his mental health struggles&lt;/a&gt;. When I was starting my project Trio, I wanted to emphasize its friendliness and accessibility, so I borrowed his &quot;for humans&quot; tagline, and started the documentation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/python-trio/trio/blob/37de153f858e29df3a19db9fffcd0fb3f2308951/docs/source/index.rst&quot;&gt;quoting him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started working on adding async support to requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2017, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/python-trio/urllib3/issues/1&quot;&gt;started working&lt;/a&gt; on adding async support to urllib3, which is the underlying HTTP library that Requests uses. This was &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; experimental. Historically, the state of the art was that you had one HTTP client library for synchronous code, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twisted/treq&quot;&gt;for Twisted&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/httpclient.html#tornado.httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient&quot;&gt;for Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html&quot;&gt;for asyncio&lt;/a&gt;, and so on – each maintained as independent projects that didn't share code. Everyone knows this is silly, but it's very challenging to fix: you need deep expertise in HTTP, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in all these different approaches to networking, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; some clever idea for how to reconcile their seemingly irreconcilable APIs. So every previous attempt had failed. Now I thought I had a clever idea, so I gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reitz was very interested in this work, because he very much wanted async support in Requests, but – as he told me – didn't know how to solve these problems himself. We had some video calls and IRC discussions, and he tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/904399257804922881&quot;&gt;leverage his notoriety to recruit volunteers and send them my way&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing much came of this, but I kept plugging away, along with some other Trio contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vorpus.org/blog/why-im-not-collaborating-with-kenneth-reitz/requests3-features.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Reitz's fundraising page, showing the promised features in Requests 3&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on March 7 2018, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/971523729632178176&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that work had begun on &quot;Requests 3&quot;, that its headline feature would be the native async/await support I was working on, and that he was seeking donations to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most open-source projects struggle to raise a few thousand dollars to hold a meeting, but this got people excited. He was deluged with donations from both individuals and large companies like Microsoft, Google, Slack, etc., and the fundraiser total quickly reached ~$30k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 15 2018, he contacted me to talk about the fundraiser. He told me he was uncertain what to do with this amount of money – he said his original goal was just to raise $5k to buy a computer. Privately, I was skeptical that the $5k computer had anything to do with Requests. Requests is a small pure-Python library; if you want to work on it, then any cheap laptop is more than sufficient. $5k is the price of a beefy server or &lt;a href=&quot;https://techbuyersguru.com/best-5000-gaming-pc-build-ultra-extreme-4k-threadripper-may-2019&quot;&gt;top-end gaming rig&lt;/a&gt;. But I figured that even if he spent $5k of the money on some unrelated computer, we could call that compensation for his past work, and it would still leave ~$25k to fulfill the promises he'd made in the fundraiser. And this was clearly a great opportunity to build some amazing new stuff. So I didn't say anything about the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I gave some general tips from my experience with fund-raising and grants, emphasizing the importance of transparency to maintain trust, and recommending he set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship&quot;&gt;fiscal sponsorship&lt;/a&gt; relationship with the Python Software Foundation (PSF) or a similar non-profit. And I tried to help with finding ways to spend the money effectively – for example, I was already working full-time, but I contacted one of the volunteers who'd been helping me to see if they were available for a contracting gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, he also did some experiments with our work-in-progress on urllib3, which led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/974963822682427393&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating &quot;Requests Core&quot; issuing multiple HTTP requests in parallel. &quot;Requests Core&quot; here was a snapshot of our work, that he forked and renamed. As far as I know, the only thing added was some basic HTTP/2 support, but unfortunately (and despite our warnings beforehand) this used a dead-end approach, so the code wasn't useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, there were definitely some odd features in our interactions, but, you know, people are odd sometimes. I personally wouldn't have announced a fundraiser without first talking to the people actually working on the features I was promising, but I was confident we could find some way to spend the money effectively. Maybe his HTTP/2 code wasn't useful, but at least he was getting some experience with async/await. I thought it would work out OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, there were some more odd things – different members of the Requests maintainers team reported hearing very different stories about what was happening to the money. But the big change came in late May 2018, when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://vorpus.org/blog/a-farewell-to-the-berkeley-institute-for-data-science/&quot;&gt;left UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; and started consulting. This seemed like a potential win-win – I was looking for work and excited about the project, and he was stuck with money he had no way to spend. So I sent him an email to explore further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a month and several follow-up pings, he finally responded. His main points were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He actually only raised $28k.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Most of it&quot; went to taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He expected me to do the work of fulfilling the commitments he'd made for new features in Requests 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But none of the money was available to fulfill those commitments; instead, he was going to wait for me to implement the new features for him, and then he needed the entire $28k to pay for writing documentation for my features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I couldn't fulfill his commitments on a volunteer basis, he encouraged me to hold my own fundraiser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ended by suggesting we do a call that week to discuss details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was bewildered. That's not how taxes work. It's not how commitments work. The idea that novel technology stacks are free but a few pages of docs cost $28k is bizarre. The idea that you can't afford to implement new features because you're going to spend the money on documenting the new features you can't afford to build... it doesn't make any sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he'd found another way to use the money on Requests, then I would have been totally happy. I didn't have any claim on the money. But this was something else entirely. I was extremely concerned. But I still wanted to get the best outcome we could for the project and the community, so I tried to keep the lines of communication open. I agreed that a call would be a good idea, and suggested some times. I also expressed my worry that he was risking his reputation – more strongly this time – and reiterated my offer to help, writing: &quot;I think right now there is a real risk that requests 3 never materializes and the public impression becomes &quot;oh yeah Kenneth Reitz stole that money&quot;. I really hope neither of these things happens. But hope isn't a plan. I think we need a plan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point he stopped answering my emails, and deleted the fundraising page – the one with the record of donations received, and what he was promising in return – from his website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180701201816/https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180715115213/https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt;). He also updated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commit/f4818b2010ce0846e9ddc85f439b80303a395494#diff-caf2a6b8f4947d018f68893c695b5202L86&quot;&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commit/704abf13325355497fc2df73259fb24615c237b9&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and his blog (&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180405031054/https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/call-for-sponsors-requests-30-development&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180810042517/https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/call-for-sponsors-requests-30-development&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt;) to remove references to the deleted page. Some months later, he put up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180916141516/https://www.kennethreitz.org/requests3/&quot;&gt;new page at the original URL&lt;/a&gt;, requesting that anyone who had questions about the fundraiser should contact him privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our only contact since then was an email he sent me out of the blue on February 9 this year. Instead of responding to anything I'd said before, he suggested that he and I write a joint grant proposal to the PSF, to pay me to do the same work that his fundraiser was allegedly funding. Of course this was a non-starter. I'm pretty sure the PSF is too savvy to fund something like this without asking some tough questions about where the other money went. And even if they didn't, and even if we somehow ignored the ethical issues, he was effectively asking me to link our reputations together, so that if his handling of the fundraiser blew up, it would implicate me as well. I didn't reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is familiar with standard practices for handling fundraising in open-source projects. So as a comparison, let me explain how the Python Software Foundation's &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG&quot;&gt;Packaging Working Group&lt;/a&gt; handled the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-awarded-moss-grant-pypi.html&quot;&gt;funding for the new PyPI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was our first time getting an external grant like this, we started by making a plan for what to do and who would do it, including identifying existing contributors who were available to work as contractors. Only after that was in place did we apply for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after the money arrived, we didn't just hand it over. Each of the contractors wrote up a few paragraphs to formally state their rates and what they were committing to, the group reviewed them, and then we held a quick vote over email to approve them. The contractors who were members of the Working Group didn't vote on their own proposals. Everyone provided regular invoices. And the whole process was ultimately overseen by the PSF's Board of Directors, who are elected by the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty lightweight process, and it isn't infallible, but it provides a baseline level of transparency and accountability. And the PSF is happy to provide this service for any Python-related project; for example, they handle donations for &lt;a href=&quot;https://palletsprojects.com/blog/donate/&quot;&gt;Flask and related projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Reitz simply didn't know how these things are normally done, and this is all an unfortunate but understandable mistake. However, I find this unlikely. At the time Reitz ran his fundraiser, he was sitting on the PSF Board of Directors. And as a member of the Packaging Working Group, he participated in the voting for the PyPI funding, which happened a few months before he started his fundraiser. And yet, none of the PSF staff I've talked to knew about his fundraiser until I told them about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: He chose a fundraiser structure that avoids standard accountability mechanisms he was familiar with. He never had any plan or capability to deliver what he promised. And when I offered a way for him to do it anyway, he gave me some bafflegab about how expensive it is to write docs. Effectively, his public promises about how he would use the Requests 3 money were lies from start to finish, and he hasn't shown any remorse or even understanding that this is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A betrayal of trust like this damages the entire community. It's hard enough raising money for open-source as it is; this kind of thing &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; doesn't help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on a more personal level, I felt his interactions with me were extremely manipulative. I felt like he tried to exploit me, and that he tried to make me complicit in covering up his lies to protect his reputation. I was extremely uncomfortable with the idea of going along with this, but he created a situation where my only other options were to either give up on working on async entirely, or else to go public with the whole story, at potentially serious cost to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn't sure what to do, so I started to quietly contacting other community members to get more context. I quickly discovered that contrary to Reitz's public reputation, every time I talked to anyone who had worked with him directly, they expressed serious discomfort with him, and many had their own disturbing stories – mine was nowhere near the worst. Here are some quotes to give you the flavor. I've anonymized most of these, but everyone quoted here is someone I trust, who maintains or previously maintained major open-source Python packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I HATE HIM SO MUCH, he is such a fucking narcissist power broker ... his actions have &quot;abuser&quot; all over them&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has a reasonable eye for API design. pretty much everything else about him bothers me&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;we have a special maintainer channel on [...] where we basically figure out how to work around kenneth&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sigmavirus24&quot;&gt;Ian Stapleton Cordasco&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to go on the record publicly: &quot;Having to deal with Kenneth all these years has made it such that I barely work on python open source software anymore and have largely, quietly left the community&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I found especially disturbing: whenever I talked to any of his long-term collaborators about my experience, they immediately jumped to reassure me that I wasn't going crazy. Which... I mean, I appreciated the support. But it was clear this isn't the first time they'd had to do this. Apparently after people start working with Reitz, they always need to be reassured that they can trust their own perceptions. These collaborators have been doing this for so long that this seems normal to them. But it's not normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the classic &quot;missing stair&quot; problem. Those in the inner circle quietly work around the toxic person. Outsiders come in blind. I'm pretty well-connected in the Python world, and I came in blind. In retrospect, I can see some warning signs. The insistence on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur&quot;&gt;auteur&lt;/a&gt; status now seems less like a charming quirk, and more like a calculated bluff to claim credit and power while denying responsibility. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kennethreitz/status/997485342579220482&quot;&gt;insistence on &quot;positivity&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is a common tactic among those who want to avoid accountability. But they fooled me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I keep thinking about: the first time I talked to him about async in Requests, months before the fundraiser, he made a strange comment: he pointed out that he was totally dependent on me to implement this, and therefore, if I were to demand that he make Requests use Trio (my library) by default instead of AsyncIO (the better-known competitor), then he'd have no choice but to acquiesce. It struck me as an incredibly strange thing to bring up – it was almost like he was asking me to manipulate him. At the time, I mumbled something about wanting to succeed on the merits, not by blackmail, and recommended that he not set a default at all. In retrospect, I'm reminded of how con artists often start by tempting their victims into some minor unethical act, so that as the con escalates they feel trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His collaborators also consistently cited his bipolar disorder as an excuse for whatever he did. I think this is deeply unfair to Reitz, and to everyone struggling with mental health issues. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tmcolon/its-a-mental-illness-not-an-excuse-to-be-an-a-hole-db0c909d14f9&quot;&gt;Illness does not erase the harm someone does to others, or their responsibility for their actions.&lt;/a&gt; Many people manage their conditions without causing this kind of harm, and when they mess up, they make amends, just like the rest of us. If someone can't do that, then as a community, we can have compassion but shouldn't give them power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people don't realize how little Reitz actually has to do with Requests development. For many years now, actual maintenance has been done almost exclusively by other volunteers. If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/requests/&quot;&gt;maintainers list on PyPI&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see he doesn't have PyPI rights to his own project, because he kept breaking stuff, so the real maintainers insisted on revoking his access. If you clone the Requests git repo, you can run &lt;code&gt;git log requests/&lt;/code&gt; to see a list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commits/master/requests&quot;&gt;every time someone changed the library's source code&lt;/a&gt;, either directly or by merging someone else's pull request. The last time Reitz did either was in May 2017, when he made some whitespace cleanups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least as far as commits go, his main contributions since then appear to consist of merging some small doc fixes, and monetizing the project by adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commit/86914e2ddab3da351e484a3211406962ce1922c3&quot;&gt;donation links&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/4779&quot;&gt;ads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/commit/63e7748fe502f44d112486d81a0da8cf38f36455&quot;&gt;intrusive sponsored links&lt;/a&gt;, etc. All of this money goes directly into his pocket, not the project's maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned that he has a history of selling premium support contracts for Requests, where he took the money and then delegated the actual work to unpaid volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have any objection to trying to make money from open-source. I've written before about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://vorpus.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-investment-in-open-source-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;open-source doesn't get nearly enough investment&lt;/a&gt;. I do object to exploiting volunteers, driving out community members, and lying to funders and the broader community. Reitz has a consistent history of doing all these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've struggled to decide what to do here. Since last year, I've tried to be very cautious when speaking to people about this, because I don't want to start false rumors or feed an internet mob. (This has also meant keeping quiet about the work we've been doing on async in urllib3, and made it difficult for me to work on it at all.) And I'm scared of how making this public might affect my own reputation and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided to speak out because I care deeply about the Python community and its members. If one of our community's most prominent members freely lies to donors and harms volunteers, and if we all let that go without saying anything, then that puts everything we've built together at risk. And I'm in a better position than many to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is the internet, I have to say explicitly: Please do not harass or abuse Reitz. That's never appropriate. (And in case you're the kind of person that doesn't find moral arguments convincing, then consider: he clearly wants attention.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call on Reitz to make a public accounting of the money he raised and how it was spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge the Requests project maintainers to transition their project to a more normal, less dysfunctional governance model. You can acknowledge his contributions without buying into his personal mythology. His insights are not irreplaceable. You know this situation is harming you and your users. You and your users are more important than his ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I'm going to focus on my own work. I'm done keeping secrets to protect Reitz from the consequences of his actions; what happens next is up to him and the larger Python community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone needs a listening ear, I can be reached at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:njs@pobox.com&quot;&gt;njs@pobox.com&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also around at PyCon this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>500 days of Duolingo: What you can and can’t learn from a language app</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/smarter-living/500-days-of-duolingo-what-you-can-and-cant-learn-from-a-language-app.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/smarter-living/500-days-of-duolingo-what-you-can-and-cant-learn-from-a-language-app.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If mobile language-learning apps are to be believed, it’s never been easier to pick up another language. Just spend 20 minutes a day with a few virtual flashcards and you’ll be fluent in no time! The reality is a lot more nuanced — and arguably more disappointing — than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Apps like &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.memrise.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Memrise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.babbel.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Babbel&lt;/a&gt; all promise to teach you how to read, write, or speak a new language, all from your phone. While they’re similar in concept, they differ a lot in the specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-1p7a59k ez3869y0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Duolingo offers a skill tree of lessons that use listening exercises, flashcards, and multiple choice questions to drill you on new words, phrases, and sentences. Most questions have a comment thread where users can discuss a particular question in detail. The service also has community features that let you connect with other people who are learning the same language you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Memrise offers similar lessons to Duolingo, introducing new words and phrases with flashcards, listening exercises, and more. However, the app has a few unique features: on new words, you can write a note (called a “mem”) with anything that helps you remember the new word or phrase. These will appear later when you come across the word again. It also offers a feature called Learn With Locals, which pairs words with videos of native speakers saying the phrase out loud and demonstrating the phrase. For example, a speaker might shiver when describing cold weather. This helps connect words with their meaning. Memrise also offers more explanatory cards than Duolingo offers when introducing new or complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Babbel is different from the other two. While it uses similar multiple choice or listening exercises as the others, it uses conversational examples to demonstrate how to use new words or phrases when speaking with another person. It also offers a speech recognition feature that lets you speak words back during an exercise instead of writing them out or answering a multiple choice question. This helps you learn how to pronounce words properly, or at least properly enough for your phone to recognize what you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Despite their differences, they have the same goal: use daily exercises on your phone to teach you an entire language. It’s an enticing promise, especially if you’re not already immersed in a culture or education system that will give you the exposure you need to pick up a second language. The question is, are they effective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After I accumulated a Duolingo streak in excess of 500 days — a feat that, thanks to the app’s &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tehawesome/status/719658102887305216?lang=en&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;notoriously insistent reminders&lt;/a&gt;, has now come to define my self-worth — I found myself in a better place to judge just how much an app alone can really teach you. The short answer is that you can definitely learn &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; things from an app, but if you want to become fluent in a language — or even conversational — they won’t be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-dwo1qx eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-71a5183f&quot;&gt;Language apps are great for writing systems and basic phrases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The phrase “learning a language” is deceptively reductive. A language isn’t a singular monolith, but rather a complex interconnected system of components that build a way to communicate. The lexicon consists of the individual words, which speakers have to memorize. The syntax and grammar tell speakers how to properly structure those words in a sentence. Then there’s the writing system, which is the visual representation of words or sounds that allow words to be constructed (for example, in English, the writing system is the alphabet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For languages that have a different writing system, like Japanese, Russian, or Korean, language apps can be an excellent way to learn. Duolingo and Memrise both use a combination of flash card and simple matching exercises to train you to recognize symbols in a new writing system, while Babbel goes an extra step further with in-lesson explanations for how new symbols or sounds work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After a few weeks or months of consistently going through lessons, it’s feasible to learn every sound and symbol in a new writing system. You won’t be able to understand every word you can read, but you’ll be a lot closer than if you started from scratch. However, that’s only part of learning a language. Understanding the alphabet used in English doesn’t inherently mean you can understand French or Spanish, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;These apps are also better at teaching &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/travel/language-tips-apps.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;basic conversational phrases&lt;/a&gt; that are useful when you’re traveling. When you visit a city in a foreign country, it’s helpful to learn a few phrases like “Where is the bathroom?” or “How much does it cost?” Using a phrase book to memorize these phrases in another language is a quick and dirty way to get the job done, but that’s not really “learning” the phrases, it’s just memorizing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For example, consider the Italian phrase “Dov’è il bagno?” This phrase means “Where is the bathroom?” However, without speaking Italian, can you tell which part of that sentence is “bathroom?” Could you adapt the sentence to say “Where is the door?” or “Where is the hotel?” Language apps don’t just teach you whole sentences. Instead, they break down component parts of a sentence and teach you a few different variations so you understand what you’re saying and can adjust what you’re saying based on your situation. It’s a useful skill to have, especially when traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most importantly, though, these apps are powerful reminders that learning a new language isn’t a part-time job. Duolingo has infamously persistent notifications that pester you to come back and give that adorable green bird attention every single day. The downside is that it can be tempting to gamify the experience, rather than actually learn. On particularly busy days, I’ve found myself redoing the earliest lessons just to keep my all-important streak going. Which leads to another important lesson: skirting the rules on a self-improvement project hurts no one but yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-dwo1qx eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-3809a96d&quot;&gt;What language apps can’t teach you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For as useful as learning a new writing system or understanding basic phrases can be, it’s only a small part of fluency in a language. What counts as “fluent” is a tough concept to describe, but the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/cefr/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Common European Framework of Reference for Languages&lt;/a&gt; (or CEFR) is a widely-accepted standard for approximating fluency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The six CEFR levels are necessarily broad and can overlap a bit, but here’s a (very) brief overview of what each means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;css-1p7a59k ez3869y0&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;At level A1, learners should know basic phrases, be able to introduce themselves and ask simple personal questions, and understand basic interactions if their conversation partner speaks slowly. Level A2 includes understanding common expressions, communicating about routine tasks, and describing simple aspects of the speaker’s background. Together, these two levels make up the Basic stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Level B1 starts to introduce more complex ideas like explaining their opinions, dreams, and ambitions, or handling complex tasks while traveling. Level B2 expects speakers to be able to speak with native speakers of a language without straining, and have complex technical discussions related to their field of expertise. These two levels make up the Independent stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1e7dx92 evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, a level C1 speaker should be able to communicate flexibly in social, professional, and academic settings, understand a wide variety of topics, and recognize implicit meaning. C2, the highest level, expects the learner to “understand with ease virtually everything heard or read,” and summarize information from different sources. Levels C1 and C2 make up the Proficient stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;If it’s not already obvious, language apps simply can’t get someone to level C2 — or anywhere close — on their own. There simply aren’t lessons to teach you, for example, how to have a complex conversation about banking regulations or astrophysics or whatever your field of expertise. It also means that if you stick solely to the lesson plans in each app, you won’t communicate with another person. By definition, these two limitations would rule out reaching even level B2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some apps also have a hard time teaching complex grammar. In Japanese, for one small example, “particles” are core parts of a sentence that indicate how words relate to each other in a sentence. They’re usually written with the same symbols used to spell words — sort of like how “a” is both a letter, but also a word on its own — which can get confusing since Japanese doesn’t use spaces between words and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Duolingo often just drops a new particle on you without much explanation of what it does or even that it’s a particle at all. Memrise handles this a bit better, with lessons dedicated to how certain particles and grammar work, but it helps to have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;external lessons&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor, or best of all a native speaker to help explain some of the finer points of nuance in a language’s grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Language apps also struggle with some of the unspoken aspects of communicating in a language. To focus on Japanese again, there are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wa-pedia.com/language/politeness_japanese.shtml&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;distinct levels of formality and politeness&lt;/a&gt; which dictate what form a word should take based on your relationship with the person you’re speaking to. So, for example, you may use one form of a sentence when speaking to a friend, but a more formal version when speaking to a boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Furthermore, body language and posture can have a dramatic impact on how your speech is perceived, and language apps tend not to cover this at all. While understanding body language is not strictly a requirement of any CEFR level, it’s hard to navigate a conversation fluently without a general understanding of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/magazine/03wwln-safire-t.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;what certain gestures mean&lt;/a&gt;, or what actions are impolite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most importantly, though, language apps are not other humans. It sounds like an obvious observation, but the entire point of learning a language is to communicate with other people. You can learn as many words or sentences as you want, but until you’re able to have a conversation with another person, you’ll never be fluent. Or, according to the CEFR model, you won’t even be halfway there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For that reason alone, learning a language with an app should be a starting point, not the end. If you make it through an entire Duolingo skill tree or a Memrise lesson plan, it might be time to upgrade to an in-person class, or you might want to find a native speaker to practice with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Repositories held for ransom by using valid credentials</title>
<link>https://about.gitlab.com/2019/05/03/suspicious-git-activity-security-update/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.gitlab.com/2019/05/03/suspicious-git-activity-security-update/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We've learned of suspicious git activity using valid credentials (a password or personal access token) on GitLab. We identified the source based on a support ticket filed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/209448/gitlab-account-hacked-and-repo-wiped&quot;&gt;Stefan Gabos&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and immediately began investigating the issue. This is a user insecure practices issue, and is not specific to GitLab, as other git repositories are affected by this as well. We are issuing this advisory to all git repo users so that we can help heighten awareness of this issue and help git's user community protect their own data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breaches seem to rely on the attacker having knowledge of the affected users passwords in order &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-is-wiping-git-repositories-and-asking-for-a-ransom/&quot;&gt;to wipe their Git repositories and hold them for ransom&lt;/a&gt;. We have notified affected GitLab users and are working as quickly as possible to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As a result of our investigation, we have strong evidence that the compromised accounts have account passwords being stored in plaintext on a deployment of a related repository. We strongly encourage the use of password management tools to store passwords in a more secure manner, and enabling two-factor authentication wherever possible, both of which would have prevented this issue.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;- Kathy Wang, Senior Director, Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-you-can-protect-yourself&quot;&gt;How you can protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These breaches seemed to rely on the attacker having knowledge of the affected user’s password. We highly recommend strong passwords and unique passwords for everything (using a good password manager helps manage this). We strongly recommend all GitLab users enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.html&quot;&gt;two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/&quot;&gt;SSH keys&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen your GitLab account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may further protect your groups by applying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/two_factor_authentication.html#enforcing-2fa-for-all-users-in-a-group&quot;&gt;“Require all users in this group to setup Two-factor authentication”&lt;/a&gt; setting in the Group settings under “Permissions, LFS, 2FA”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it can help to prevent a breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitigation&quot;&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that no data has been lost, unless the owner/maintainer of the repository did not have a local copy and the GitLab copy was the only one. In some cases, repository files were changed. After updating account credentials, we recommend making use of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; commands to restore your repository to its previous state. If you have a full current copy of the repository on your computer, you can force push to the current HEAD of your local copy using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin HEAD:master --force&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, you can still clone the repository and make use of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is related to the use of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, GitLab does not have its own documentation or examples, but we have found these articles that may be of use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 2, 2019 at approximately 10:00pm GMT GitLab received the first report of a repository being wiped with a single file left in place that demanded a bitcoin ransom be paid for the return of data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;To recover your lost data and avoid leaking it: Send us 0.1 Bitcoin (BTC) to our Bitcoin address 1ES14c7qLb5CYhLMUekctxLgc1FV2Ti9DA and contact us by Email at admin@gitsbackup.com with your Git login and a Proof of Payment. If you are unsure if we have your data, contact us and we will send you a proof. Your code is downloaded and backed up on our servers. If we dont receive your payment in the next 10 Days, we will make your code public or use them otherwise.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began to receive multiple reports, and were able to search through logs and repositories to determine the extent of the impact. A few repositories had the ransom threat left behind, some repositories were simply wiped, and a few accounts appeared to be successfully accessed by the attacker but not modified. All total, 131 users and 163 repositories were, at a minimum, accessed by the attacker. Affected accounts were temporarily disabled, and the owners were notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed the following items in reference to this incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The source IP of the attacks came from the 185.234.216.0/24 range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attacker appeared to use some type of “update script” in an attempt to perform the accesses, and the nature of the individual accesses strongly suggested the use of plaintext passwords that were locally stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually all of the repositories were private repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the accounts impacted had two-factor authentication enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since not all of the accesses resulted in both a repository wipe and a ransom note, this suggests that the attacker’s update script was possibly not working properly. This could be a result of a generic script being used against GitLab as well as GitHub and Bitbucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuing our investigation, and if we uncover more details that we feel will benefit our users and the security community at large, we will communicate that information as quickly and as transparently as possible. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our security and would appreciate any comments and questions you might have.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Negotiations Failed: How Oracle Killed Java EE</title>
<link>https://headcrashing.wordpress.com/2019/05/03/negotiations-failed-how-oracle-killed-java-ee/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://headcrashing.wordpress.com/2019/05/03/negotiations-failed-how-oracle-killed-java-ee/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today Eclipse Foundation’s president Mike Milinkovic blogged about the final result of the confidential trademark negotiations between Oracle and the Eclipse Foundation. As we remember, Oracle announced that Java EE will be open sourced to that organization and it would become true open source. After 18 months of intensive negotiations the effort has come to an end: It failed. There will be no trademark agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason simply spoken is, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/boardminutes/2019_03_26_Minutes.pdf&quot;&gt;recent board meeting minutes&lt;/a&gt;, that Oracle wanted to have in turn a set of inacceptable demands. Some of them would put the existence of the Eclipse Foundation at severe risk. Oracle claimed that products distributed by the Eclipse Foundation (like the Eclipse IDE) must &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be bundled with Java runtimes certified particularly &lt;em&gt;by Oracle and its licencees&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;not any other&lt;/em&gt; vendor’s certification and not any uncertified runtime. Hence, the IDE and GlassFish wouldn’t be vendor-neutral products anymore. This restriction was not told at the start of the negotations, it was introduced much later, while the transfer was already in progress. One could assume that it was a reaction upon the donation of IBM’s OpenJ9 JVM, which is a clear threat to Oracle’s Java business. But once Eclipse products would be not vendor-neutral anymore, the EF’s tax exemption might become void, which would mean a financial fiasco, or possibly mean the end of the organization as a hole. Hence, it not only was &lt;em&gt;inacceptable&lt;/em&gt;, but it was simply &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; to agree to Oracle’s requests, so the negotiations more or less completely failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is left over is not more but also not less the end of Java EE. The Eclipse Foundation may use some rather outdated code, but &lt;em&gt;must not modify&lt;/em&gt; it. If it gets modified, it must be &lt;em&gt;renamed&lt;/em&gt; – both, the project name (like JAX-RS, which is not nice but acceptable) but also &lt;em&gt;the package name&lt;/em&gt; (like javax.*), which means, existing applications will not run on the updated platform without recompilation of the application after intensive refactoring. Hence, it will become a completely new and incompatible platform, the worst case possible, as it not only voids the “WORA” (Write Once Run Anywhere) principle, it simply won’t happen in reality: After 18 months virtually no application vendor really wants to spend the time and money to update all customers with recompiled versions just for the sake of a renamed platform with a dubios future. The future is unclear because Oracle already started a blocking politics at the Eclipse Foundation’s board, where Oracle has a seat, and where &lt;em&gt;unanimous&lt;/em&gt; decisions are needed. Oracle now has the power, and apparently will use that power, to block the foundation’s future. It demonstrated that power already in a board meeting, where they had the sole vote against an otherwise unaimous move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current reaction of the Eclipse Foundation is to demonstrate success to rescue at least some value of the intensively marketed Jakarta trademark. But at what price? For what keeping a trademark that became an empty hull now? It now is not the successor of Java EE as a global standard anymore, it is just some framework made by some foundation, and users eventually will learn and draw conclusions. Currently plans have intensivated to rename everything ASAP. But who will actually jump on that train, when it implies changing all existing applications? Eclipse’s Mike Milinkovic still sees the future bright. For me, the glass is not just half-empty anymore: Today it cracked into pieces. This is the day when Java EE was killed by Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
