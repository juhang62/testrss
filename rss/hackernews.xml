<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;whatsapp&quot;&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; founder, Brian Acton, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton-is-leaving-to-start-a-non-profit/&quot;&gt;left Facebook a year ago&lt;/a&gt; — before going on to publicly bite the hand that fed him, by voicing support for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/after-selling-his-company-to-facebook-for-19-billion-brian-acton-joins-deletefacebook/&quot;&gt;#DeleteFacebook movement&lt;/a&gt; (and donating &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/&quot;&gt;$50M to alternative encrypted messaging app, Signal&lt;/a&gt;) — has delved into the ethics clash behind his acrimonious departure in an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for leaving a cool ~$850M in unvested stock on the table by not sticking it out a few more months inside Zuckerberg’s mothership, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/jan-koum-quits-facebook/&quot;&gt;co-founder Jan Koum did&lt;/a&gt;. (Collecting air cooled Porsches must be an expensive hobby, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton has also suggested he was used by &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to help get its 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp past EU regulators who had been concerned it might be able to link accounts — as it subsequently did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“You mean it won’t make as much money”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WhatsApp founders’ departure from Facebook boils down to a disagreement over how to monetize their famously ‘anti-ads’ messaging platform from Menlo Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though how the pair ever imagined their platform would be safe from ads in the clutches of, er, an ad giant like Facebook remains one of the tech world’s greatest unexplained brain-fails. Or else they were mostly just thinking of the billions Facebook was paying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton said he tried to push Facebook towards an alternative, less privacy hostile business model for WhatsApp — suggesting a metered-user model such as by charging a tenth of a penny after a certain large number of free messages were used up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that “very simple business” idea was rejected outright by Facebook COO &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/sheryl-sandberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;sheryl-sandberg&quot;&gt;Sheryl Sandberg,&lt;/a&gt; who he said told him “it won’t scale”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I called her out one time,” Acton also told Forbes. “I was like, ‘No, you don’t mean that it won’t scale. You mean it won’t make as much money as…,’ and she kind of hemmed and hawed a little. And we moved on. I think I made my point… They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople. They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1611080&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1611080&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-699658436.jpeg?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;453&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;CANNES, FRANCE – JUNE 22: Chief Operating Officer of Facebook Sheryl Sandberg attends the Cannes Lions Festival 2017 on June 22, 2017 in Cannes, France.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it seems Acton and Koum had a pretty major inkling of the looming clash of business “principles and ethics” with Facebook’s management, given they had a clause written into their contract to allow them to immediately get all their stock if the company began “implementing monetization initiatives” without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with his ideas being actively rejected, and with Facebook ramping up the monetization pressure on the “product group” (which is how Acton says Zuckerberg viewed WhatsApp), he thought he saw a route to both cash out and get out — by calling in the contract clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook had other ideas, though. Company lawyers told him the clause didn’t yet apply because it had only been “exploring”, not yet implementing monetization. At a meeting over the issue he said Zuckerberg also told him: “This is probably the last time you’ll ever talk to me.” So presumably things got pretty chilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/&quot;&gt;$19BN deal for Facebook to buy WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; had been rushed through over a weekend in 2014, and Acton said there had been little time to examine what would turn out to be crucial details like the monetization clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not doing the due diligence on that clearly cost him a second very sizeable personal fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, faced with more uncomfortably chilly meetings, and a legal fight to get the unvested stock, Acton said he decided to just take the winnings he already had and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even rejected an alternative proposed settlement (without fleshing out exactly what it was) — saying Facebook management had wanted to put a nondisclosure agreement in it, and “t&lt;span&gt;hat was part of the reason that I got sort of cold feet in terms of trying to settle with these guys”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, I sold my company. I am a sellout. I acknowledge that,” he also told Forbes, indicating that he’s not unaware that the prospect of a guy who got really, really wealthy by selling out his principles and his users then trying to claw out even more cash from the ad tech giant he sold to probably wouldn’t look so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least this way he can say he took an $850M haircut to show he ‘cared’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-new-message-to-whatsapp-make-money-1533139325?mod=rss_Technology&quot;&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; Facebook confirmed that from next year it will indeed begin injecting ads into WhatsApp statuses — which is where the multimedia montage Stories format it cloned from Snapchat has been bolted onto the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So WhatsApp’s ~&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/whatsapp-hits-1-5-billion-monthly-users-19b-not-so-bad/&quot;&gt;1.5BN+ monthly users&lt;/a&gt; can look forward to unwelcome intrusions as they try to go about their daily business of sending messages to their friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly Facebook will ‘encourage’ WhatsApp users to eyeball the marketing noise it intends to monetize remains to be seen. But tweaks to make statues more prominent/unavoidable look likely. Facebook is a master of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/&quot;&gt;dark pattern design&lt;/a&gt;, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also set to charge businesses for messages they receive from potential customers via the WhatsApp platform — of between a half a penny and 9 cents, depending on the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in a way, it’s picking up on Acton’s suggestion of a ‘metered model’ — just in a fashion that will “scale” the bottom line in Sandberg’s sought for ‘loadsamoney’ style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though of course neither Acton nor Koum will be around to cash in on the stock uplift as Facebook imposes its ad model onto a whole new unwilling platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“I think everyone was gambling… because enough time had passed”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In perhaps the most telling tidbit of the interview, Acton reveals that even before the WhatsApp acquisition had been cleared he was carefully coached by Facebook to tell European regulators it would be “really difficult” for it to combine WhatsApp and Facebook user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was coached to explain that it would be really difficult to merge or blend data between the two systems,” Acton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ‘impossible conjoining’ that Facebook subsequently, miraculously went on to achieve, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/&quot;&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;, which later earned it &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/facebook-fined-122m-in-europe-over-misleading-whatsapp-filing/&quot;&gt;a $122M fine from the European Commission&lt;/a&gt; for providing incorrect or misleading information on the original filing. (Facebook has maintained that unintentional “errors” were to blame.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the acquisition had been cleared Acton said he later learned that elsewhere in Facebook there were indeed “plans and technologies to blend data” between the two services — and that specifically it could use the 128-bit string of numbers assigned to each phone to connect WhatsApp and Facebook user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone-number matching is another method used to link accounts — and sharing WhatsApp users’ phone numbers with the parent group was a change pushed onto users via the 2016 update to WhatsApp’s terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Though Facebook’s linking of WhatsApp and Facebook accounts for ad targeting purposes remains suspended in Europe, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/08/facebook-whatsapp-data-sharing-now-on-pause-in-uk-at-regulators-request/&quot;&gt;after regulatory push-back&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think everyone was gambling because they thought that the EU might have forgotten because enough time had passed,” he also said in reference to Facebook pushing ahead with account matching, despite having told European regulators it couldn’t be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators did not forget. But a $122M fine is hardly a proportionate disincentive for a company as revenue-heavy as Facebook (which earned a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/facebook-q2-2018-earnings/&quot;&gt;$13.23BN in Q2&lt;/a&gt;). And which can therefore swallow the penalty as another standard business cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton said Facebook also sought “broader rights” to WhatsApp users data under the new terms of service — and claims he and Koum pushed back and reached a compromise with Facebook management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘compromise’ being that the clause about ‘no ads’ would remain — but Facebook would get to link accounts to power friend suggestions on Facebook and to offer its advertising partners better targets for ads on Facebook. So really they just bought themselves (and their users) a bit more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, with both founders out of the company Facebook is free to scrub the no ads clause and use the already linked accounts for ad targeting in both directions (not just at Facebook users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Acton and Koum ever really thought they could prevent that adtech endgame they were horribly naive. Again, most probably, they just balanced the billions they got paid against that outcome and thought 2x [shrug emoji].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s push to monetize WhatsApp faster than its founders were entirely comfortable with looks to be related to its own concerns about needing to please investors by being able to show continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/facebook-q2-2018-earnings/&quot;&gt;Q2&lt;/a&gt; was not a stellar one, with its stock taking a hit on slowing user growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years after the WhatsApp acquisition, Acton said Zuckerberg was growing impatient — recounting how he told an all-hands meeting for WhatsApp staffers Facebook needed WhatsApp revenues to continue to show growth to Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, Acton said Facebook had targeted a $10 billion revenue run rate within five years of monetization of WhatsApp — numbers he thought sounded too high and which therefore must be reliant on ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so within a year or so Acton was on his way out — not quite as personally mega-wealthy as he could have been. But definitely don’t cry for him. He’s doing fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/open-whisper-systems&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;open-whisper-systems&quot;&gt;Signal Foundation,&lt;/a&gt; where Acton now works, he says the goal is to make “private communication accessible and ubiquitous”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the alternative e2e encrypted app has only unquantified “millions” of users to WhatsApp and Facebook’s multi billions. But at least it has $50M of Acton’s personal fortune behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mmm, Pi-hole</title>
<link>https://www.troyhunt.com/mmm-pi-hole/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/mmm-pi-hole/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a love-hate relationship with ad blockers. On the one hand, I despise the obnoxious ads that are forced down our throats at what seems like every turn. On the other hand, I appreciate the need for publishers to earn a living so that I can consume their hard-earned work for free. Somewhere in the middle is a responsible approach, for example the sponsorship banner you see at the top of this blog. Companies &lt;em&gt;I choose to partner with&lt;/em&gt; get to appear there and they get themselves 140 characters and a link. That is all. No images. No video. No script. No HTML tags. No tracking. Sponsors are happy as they get exposure, visitors are happy because there's none of the aforementioned crap and I'm happy because it pays a lot better than ads ever did anyway. It almost seems like &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is happy. Almost...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote about a couple of years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/ad-blockers-are-part-of-the-problem/&quot;&gt;ad blockers aren't always happy&lt;/a&gt; and frankly, attitudes like that just make the whole ad problem even worse. That post attracted hundreds of comments ranging from &quot;I don't mind ads&quot; to &quot;burn them all with fire and the consequences be damned&quot;. But it's not just the detrimental impact of blocking the very source of a website's revenue that worries me, it's also the fact that running an ad blocker means giving a third party an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; amount of power over your browser. This creates a different risk to ads themselves - a much more serious one if it comes to fruition - and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.961038961039&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Do you use a popular browser extension? How confident are you that the creator wouldn’t accept a $10k offer to hand it over only to have it then go rogue on you? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hPfW5CJLUz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/hPfW5CJLUz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1037457241840877568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's actually my top tweet over the last 4 weeks by a significant margin because it's one we can all relate to. I certainly went back and revisited all the browser extensions I had installed and killed a few unnecessary ones. Bottom line is that you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to consider how much you trust the organisation (or in many cases, the &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;) behind the extensions you run and even when you do, there's no guarantee it won't be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secjuice.com/mega-nz-chrome-browser-extension-backdoored/&quot;&gt;backdoored MEGA.nz style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to keep the intro bits as brief as possible but, in a nutshell, Pi-hole is a little DNS server you run on a Raspberry Pi in your local network then point your router at such that every device in your home resolves DNS through the service. It then blacklists about 130k domains used for nasty stuff such that when any client on your network (PC, phone, smart TV) requests sleazy-ad-domain.com, the name just simply doesn't resolve. Scott Helme put me onto this originally via his two excellent posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/securing-dns-across-all-of-my-devices-with-pihole-dns-over-https-1-1-1-1/&quot;&gt;Securing DNS across all of my devices with Pi-Hole + DNS-over-HTTPS + 1.1.1.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/catching-naughty-devices-on-my-home-network/&quot;&gt;Catching and dealing with naughty devices on my home network&lt;/a&gt;. Go and read those because I'm deliberately not going to repeat them here. In fact, I hadn't even planned to write anything until I saw how much difference the service actually made. More on that in a moment, the one other bit I'll add here is that the Raspberry Pi I purchased for the setup was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.littlebird.com.au/little-bird-raspberry-pi-3-complete-starter-kit&quot;&gt;Little Bird Raspberry Pi 3 Plus Complete Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Little-Bird-Raspberry-Pi-3-Plus-Complete-Starter-Kit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Little Bird Raspberry Pi 3 Plus Complete Starter Kit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just made it a super easy turnkey solution. Plus, Little Bird Electronics down here in Aus delivered it really quickly and followed up with a personal email and a &quot;thank you&quot; for some of the other unrelated stuff I've been up to lately. Nice 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with an absolute bare bones setup which essentially involved just following the instructions on the Pi-hole site (Scott gets a bit fancier in his blog posts). I had a bit of a drama due to some dependencies and after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1044683571858890752&quot;&gt;a quick tweet for help this morning&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/failing-dependencies-on-clean-raspbian-stretch-install/13157&quot;&gt;a question on Discourse&lt;/a&gt;, I was up and running. I set my Ubiquiti network to resolve DNS through the Pi and that's it - job done! As devices started picking up the new DNS settings, I got to see just how much difference was made. I set my desktop to manually resolve through Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 whilst my laptop was using the Pi-hole which made for some awesome back to back testing. Here's what I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a popular local Aussie news site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news.com.au/&quot;&gt;news.com.au&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what it looks like with no Pi-hole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-without-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au without pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of ads on sites, not too offensive. Let's look at it from the machine routing through the Pi-hole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au with pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, there's not a whole lot of difference here. However, check out the network requests at the bottom of the browser before and after Pi-hole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-network-without-pi-hole-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au network without pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-network-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au network with pi-hole.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa! That's an 80% reduction in network requests and an 82% reduction in the number of bytes transferred. I'd talk about the reduction in load time too except it's really hard to measure because as you can see from the waterfall diagrams, with no Pi-hole it just keeps going and going and, well, it all gets a bit silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's level it up because I reckon the smuttier the publication, the bigger the Pi-hole gain. Let's try these guys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-with-no-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk with no pi hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for comparison, when loaded with the Pi-hole in place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk-with-pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now - (drum roll) - the network requests for each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-network-with-no-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk network with no-pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-network-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk network with pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit! What - why?! I snapped the one without Pi-hole at 17.4 mins after I got sick of waiting. 2,663 requests (one of which was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://report-uri.com/&quot;&gt;Report URI&lt;/a&gt;, thank you very much!) and 57.6MB. To read the freakin' news. (Incidentally, in this image more than the others you can clearly see requests to domains such as fff.dailymail.co.uk failing as the Pi-hole prevents them from resolving.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just a few quick tests, I was pretty blown away by the speed difference. I only fired this up at about 8am this morning and I'm just 9 hours into it but already seeing some pretty cool stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Pi-hole-dashboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pi-hole-dashboard&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also flagging a bunch of things I'd like to look at more, for example my wife's laptop being way chattier than everything else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Top-clients.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top clients&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Top-blocked-clients.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top blocked clients&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Wife-s-laptop-requests.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wife's laptop requests&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked yet, but if anyone knows the purpose of that microsoft.com domain that continually get Pi-holed, leave a comment below (I assume it's related to the native Windows 10 mail client). And yes, I'll chat to her about the Fox News situation as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm yet to have any legit functionality &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; because of the Pi-hole, but Scott has had to whitelist a couple of domains (literally 2, from memory) such as the Google Analytics dashboard. Of course, it's entirely feasible that legit stuff &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; break and I myself have gone through troubleshooting pains on behalf of other people before only to then realise that it was their modification of my site that caused the failure. That's always going to be a risk and frankly, that's on me if my choice of tooling breaks something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, no compromising devices, no putting your trust in the goodwill of an extension developer, no per-device effort, the bad stuff is blocked and the good stuff still works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Sponsor-message-still-works.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sponsor message still works&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Pi-hole has &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/donate/&quot;&gt;a donate page&lt;/a&gt; and this is one of those cases where if you find it as awesome as I have already, you should absolutely show them some love. Cash in some of that time you've reclaimed by not waiting for rubbish ads to load 😎&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Mmm... Pi-hole...</og:title>
<og:description>I have a love-hate relationship with ad blockers. On the one hand, I despise the obnoxious ads that are forced down our throats at what seems like every turn. On the other hand, I appreciate the need for publishers to earn a living so that I can consume their hard-earned</og:description>

<title>Oracle’s Java 11 trap</title>
<link>https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/do-not-fall-into-oracles-java-11-trap.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/do-not-fall-into-oracles-java-11-trap.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Java 11 &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;has been released&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/java-release-chains-features-and-security.html&quot;&gt;major release&lt;/a&gt; because it has long-term support (LTS). But Oracle have also set it up to be a trap (either deliberately or accidentally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The trap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 23 years, developers have downloaded the JDK from Oracle and used it for $free. Type &quot;JDK&quot; into your favourite search engine, and the top link will be to an Oracle Java SE download page (I'm deliberately not providing a link). But that search and that link is now a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oracle JDK, the one all web searches take you to, is now commercial not $free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key part of the terms is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You may not: use the Programs for any data processing or any commercial, production, or internal business purposes other than developing, testing, prototyping, and demonstrating your Application;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trap is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download Oracle JDK (because that is what you've always done, and it is what the web-search tells you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use it in production (because you didn't realise the license changed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a nasty phone call from Oracle's license enforcement teams demanding lots of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Oracle can rely on inertia from Java developers to cause them to download the wrong (commercial) release of Java. Unless you read the text/warnings/legalese very carefully you might not even realise Oracle JDK is now commercial, and that you are therefore liable to pay Oracle for Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this trap malicious behaviour on the part of Oracle? Readers will have their own opinions. I do suggest bearing in mind that Oracle invests huge amounts in developing Java, so it is reasonable to have a commercial plan available for those that want it. And they do provide a $free alternative...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use an OpenJDK build.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as their commercial JDK, Oracle produce an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;OpenJDK build&lt;/a&gt;. It is $free, zero-cost and GPL licensed (with Classpath exception so safe for commercial use). &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;Download $free Java here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the OpenJDK build from Oracle is the only one available. But more will be available soon, such as from &lt;a href=&quot;https://adoptopenjdk.net/&quot;&gt;AdoptOpenJDK&lt;/a&gt; (probably later this week). And the OpenJDK builds from groups other than Oracle will be the ones to use for Java 11 long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joda.org/2018/08/java-is-still-available-at-zero-cost.html&quot;&gt;zero-cost Java&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/time-to-look-beyond-oracles-jdk.html&quot;&gt;wide variety of OpenJDK builds&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NOpeQQtTc7A/W4T1hwB_E2I/AAAAAAAAGs4/CWQ_4eUcwjsyUl1TcY-cS_exW9NBe1UNwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/OpenJdkLogo.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NOpeQQtTc7A/W4T1hwB_E2I/AAAAAAAAGs4/CWQ_4eUcwjsyUl1TcY-cS_exW9NBe1UNwCPcBGAYYCw/s200/OpenJdkLogo.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do NOT download or use the Oracle JDK unless you intend to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Java 11, download and use an OpenJDK build, currently from &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(No comments on this post. There are plenty of other places to express opinions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;34.933510638298&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Long story short - I was brave and stood up for myself, demanding the righteous thing.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I was 15 years old back then. I had just learned how to code and my hunger for programming was insatiable. I didn't think much, browsed through relevant classifieds and sent out a couple of honest e-mails stating that I really want to have a job, but I have no real life experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;A company replied within a few days and they were interested. It was a very small company, consisting of a CTO and CEO. We agreed on 200$ for a portal type of website(it was a thing back then), with user sign-ups, public and private posts, comments and a few more things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This company was hired by a rather large media company, to develop a dedicated website for them. I knew who was behind it and I was hoping that I would get recognized by the media company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I dreamed about writing lines of code in my sleep, daydreamed through school and spent all time I could on coding the whole thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think I was done in three months or so, and then came the day I asked to be paid. I had put daily changes on their FTP server, as we agreed, so I had literally no leverage. And they stopped responding. I tried reaching out to them in numerous ways, such as using my mom's cell to call the CEO, but he hung up immediately after realizing it was me who called.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;As I realized that I had been scammed, since we did not have any form of written contract and had agreed that I would be paid in cash when the whole thing was done. Therefore I went on the media group's website, found the contact section and somehow managed to stumble upon the personal cellphone of the CEO of the media company. And I called him. I was an emotional teenager, but I spoke the truth. I did not have any demands other than to be heard. After a 10 minute long discussion where I explained that I was ripped off and worked for free for months, the CEO invited me over. I still remember the awe everyone was in, when they realized that a kid had just called them and walked through their front door in a few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;That phone call has been the best career decision I have ever made. The media company terminated their contract with the agency that had ripped me off because of terms violation - they were prohibited from outsourcing any development to any third parties, without a written permission given by the customer a.k.a media company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;And so I landed my first job! The people working for this media company were so genuine, mature and supportive, that I did not lose my love for what I did and had been in web development ever since.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;It pays off to be brave and righteous in the end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;72.942301612393&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I was single, but the programme &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; accommodate families. I've even met more than one single parent on the programme (and universally it seemed to be a wonderful experience for the child, which surprised me greatly). The spouse even gets a working visa (or did 10 years ago when I was on the programme). It's a great job.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I haven't looked at the situation recently, but there used to be an age limit of 40. I applied when I was 38, which is essentially the very last time you can do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;In case you (or anyone else) is interested, I'll write a few things about my impression of what the JET programme is (which differs slightly from the official version). The official version is that JET is the &quot;Japan Exchange Teaching&quot; programme -- so the idea is that people come to Japan to teach English. In reality, it is a rather brilliant plot by the Japanese government to both get rural people used to having foreigners in their communities, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to expand awareness of Japanese values abroad in order to soften the position of foreign powers in business and trade negotiations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Basically, what was explained to me by a few Japanese government officials (after many, many beers) is that in the 1980's Japan was flying high in the world economy, but they were having a lot of trouble with the rest of the world understanding how they did business. There are some great English language documentaries on the subject (I wish I could remember some, but I suspect you can search on Youtube to find some good ones).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;You would have American sales people coming to Japan and saying, &quot;We make car parts. Our parts are 30% cheaper than your supplier. You should buy from us&quot;. And the response would be, &quot;We've worked with our supplier for 250 years and have developed a level of trust with them. Why should we betray them for a mere 30% discount&quot; Even small things like people showing up for discussions with important business people and not bringing a souvenir as a gift, or refusing to suspend conversations until everybody had properly gone out and had a drinking party would derail a lot of trade deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;At the same time, the Japanese government was thinking, &quot;Our population is getting older and if we keep growing financially we're going to have a massive labour shortage&quot;. But the vast majority of Japanese people had &lt;em&gt;never seen a foreigner in their life&lt;/em&gt;. They realised that they needed some kind of cultural shift to accommodate the bringing in of foreign workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;They concocted this really bizarre plan where they would seek out and hire young, educated foreigners &lt;em&gt;who are from rich connected families&lt;/em&gt; and bring them to Japan for a few years. The idea was to indoctrinate these young people with Japanese ideals and then send them back to their home country. Then 20 years later, those young people would inherit their thrones (remember they are from rich, connected families) and they would be in a position to change foreign policy towards Japan. They would also be able to educate foreign businesses how to communicate to Japanese people. They would also send these young people only to rural locations (where there are no foreigners) to pave the cultural way for the inevitable influx of foreign workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;I think we're getting up over 30 years of the JET programme and it has been a crazy success - from that perspective. There has been a problem, though. When they initially set up the programme, they didn't know what the young people would do. Someone had the bright idea of having them teach English at the schools. So that's what they did. However, young, rich, snotty-nosed kids right out of school... ummm... They aren't necessarily the best workers (of course there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; exceptions to prove the rule!). In fact, historically quite a large percentage of them had never had a job in their life. They didn't know how to work, had never had any real direction in their life and were also suffering badly from other kinds of culture shock. To top it all off, virtually none of the teachers in the school system &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; these people and took it to be a particularly onerous babysitting job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Over time, the programme has started to hire a percentage of older people into the programme. They &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; look for people with good connections. Even though I do not come from a particularly wealthy family, I worked for some of the largest and most influential tech companies in the world. That's the kind of thing that has the JET programme licking their lips. You get a person with that kind of influence and a proven track record of working hard, it's great for them. They can send that person to one of the schools that are pissed off about the people who have worked there before. For example just before I came they had to fire a guy who never once showed up for work -- he went surfing every day. They needed somebody that would keep a low profile and just do what they were told.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;The JET programme in Japan, despite being wildly successful in their unadvertised nefarious plan, is under a lot of criticism for their &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; role. The JET programme pays a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more than private companies charge for &quot;assistant language teachers&quot;. Quite a few schools have moved from JET assistants to assistants from private schools. The advantages are many: usually the workers are older, experienced in teaching EFL and they are a good %30 cheaper. Why should a school hire JET assistants?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;This has caused JET to hire &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; teachers! These are people who have no money and no connections and are probably not a good fit for the original goals of the programme, but they can actually do their job when they are in Japan. I think there is some hope that the teaching skills will rub off on some of the others (it doesn't, but it's a nice thought...).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;So that's where it stood about 5-10 years ago when I was involved. I'm not sure how it's moved on from there. But basically they have 3 categories of people that they are looking for - 1. young, rich, connected people from famous universities; 2. older, connected people who have life experience; 3. people with qualifications in teaching. I think you're still more likely to get hired if you are in category 1, but there are a fair number of positions in the other categories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;commtext c00&quot;&gt;Disclaimer: many tongue in cheek comments -- I apologise if anyone found it offensive rather than humorous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Product Updates Based on Your Feedback</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;We want to be clear that this change to sign-in does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mean Chrome sync gets turned on. Users who want data like their browsing history, passwords, and bookmarks available on other devices must take additional action, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;turning on&lt;/a&gt; sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new UI reminds users which Google Account is signed in. Importantly, this allows us to better help users who share a single device (for example, a family computer). Over the years, we’ve received feedback from users on shared devices that they were confused about Chrome’s sign-in state. We think these UI changes help prevent users from inadvertently performing searches or navigating to websites that could be saved to a different user’s synced account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve heard—and appreciate—your feedback. We’re going to make a few updates in the next release of Chrome (Version 70, released mid-October) to better communicate our changes and offer more control over the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While we think sign-in consistency will help many of our users, we’re adding a control that allows users to turn off linking web-based sign-in with browser-based sign-in—that way users have more control over their experience. For users that disable this feature, signing into a Google website will not sign them into Chrome.&lt;/li&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/iam/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Identity and Access Management&lt;/a&gt; (IAM) &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;best practice&lt;/a&gt; is to require all IAM and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;root users&lt;/a&gt; in your account to sign into the AWS Management Console with &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multi-factor authentication (MFA)&lt;/a&gt;. When MFA is enabled, AWS prompts users for their username and password (the first factor – what they know) and also provides an authentication challenge such as one-time passcode (OTP) to their MFA device (the second factor – what they have). Now you can enable a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YubiKey security key&lt;/a&gt; (manufactured by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yubico&lt;/a&gt;, a third party provider) as your users’ MFA device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YubiKey security keys use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)&lt;/a&gt;, an open authentication standard that enables users to easily and securely access multiple online services using a single security key, without needing to install drivers or client software. AWS allows you to enable a YubiKey security key as the MFA device for your IAM users. You can also enable a single key for multiple IAM and root users across AWS accounts, making it easier to manage your MFA device for access to multiple users. Now, you can use your existing key to authenticate to other third-party applications, such as GitHub or Dropbox, to sign in to the AWS Management Console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I demonstrate how to enable a YubiKey for your IAM users in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IAM console&lt;/a&gt;. I then demonstrate how to sign into the AWS Management Console as an IAM user using the YubiKey security key as your MFA device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.3219373219373&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: You can enable a YubiKey security key as MFA device for your root users from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Security Credentials&lt;/a&gt; page by following a similar setup process. Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/console/mobile/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS Console Mobile App&lt;/a&gt; and mobile browsers do not currently support YubiKey security as MFA for AWS. For more information, please review &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_u2f_supported_configurations.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Supported Configurations for Using U2F Security Keys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enabling a YubiKey security key as MFA device for IAM users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow along, you must have a YubiKey security key that you want to associate with your IAM user. You can order a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Yubico-YubiKey-USB-Two-Factor-Authentication/dp/B018Y1Q71M?ref=ast_p_ep&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YubiKey security key using Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; or other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to enable a YubiKey security key for your IAM user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-1.978431372549&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sign in to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IAM console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the left navigation pane, select &lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt; and then choose the name of the user for whom you want to enable a YubiKey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;Select the &lt;strong&gt;Security Credentials&lt;/strong&gt; tab, and then select the &lt;strong&gt;Manage&lt;/strong&gt; link next to &lt;strong&gt;Assigned MFA device&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8633&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image1EnablingYubiKeyMFA-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1: Managing assigned MFA devices&quot; width=&quot;938&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8633&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 1: Managing assigned MFA devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Manage MFA Device&lt;/strong&gt; wizard, select &lt;strong&gt;U2F security key&lt;/strong&gt; and then select &lt;strong&gt;Continue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8643&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image2-1EnablingYubiKeyMFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2: Selecting your U2F security key&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8643&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 2: Selecting your U2F security key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;Insert the YubiKey security key into the USB port of your computer, wait for the key to blink, and then touch the button or gold disk on your key. If your key doesn’t blink, please select &lt;strong&gt;Troubleshoot U2F&lt;/strong&gt; to review instructions to troubleshoot the issue.&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8635&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image3EnablingYubiKeyMFA-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image 3: Inserting the security key&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;347&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8635&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 3: Inserting the security key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;You’ll receive a notification that the security key assignment was successful. The YubiKey security key is ready for use. Select &lt;strong&gt;Close&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8636&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image4EnablingYubiKeyMFA-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4: Notification of successful setup&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8636&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 4: Notification of successful setup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Security Credentials&lt;/strong&gt; tab will now display the U2F security key next to &lt;strong&gt;Assigned MFA device&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8637&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image6EnablingYubikeyMFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5: Verifying your assigned MFA device&quot; width=&quot;938&quot; height=&quot;462&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8637&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 5: Verifying your assigned MFA device&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve successfully enabled a YubiKey security key as the MFA device for your IAM user (in this example, &lt;span&gt;DBAdmin&lt;/span&gt;), I’ll demonstrate how your IAM user can use their YubiKey security key in addition to their username and password to sign into the AWS Management Console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using your YubiKey security key to sign into the AWS Management Console as an IAM user&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an IAM user with MFA enabled, you must use your MFA device to sign into the AWS Management Console. During sign-in, you first need to enter your username and password. Next, you need to complete the authentication challenge using your MFA device. Once you have successfully completed the MFA challenge, you can access the AWS Management Console.&lt;br/&gt;Follow these steps to sign into the AWS Management Console using your YubiKey security key as the MFA device:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;Enter your AWS account ID or alias to sign in as an IAM user and select &lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8638&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image6-1EnablingYubikeyMFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 6: Signing in as an IAM user&quot; width=&quot;302&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8638&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 6: Signing in as an IAM user&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;From the IAM sign-in page, re-enter your AWS account ID or alias, plus the username and password for your IAM user. Then select &lt;strong&gt;Sign in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8639&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image7EnablingYubikeyMFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 7: Entering your IAM account details&quot; width=&quot;302&quot; height=&quot;367&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8639&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 7: Entering your IAM account details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;To authenticate with your YubiKey security key, insert your key into the USB port on your computer, wait for the key to blink, and then touch the button or gold disk on your YubiKey security key. If your key doesn’t blink, please select &lt;strong&gt;Troubleshoot MFA&lt;/strong&gt; to review instructions to troubleshoot the issue.&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_8640&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/09/17/Image8EnablingYubikeyMFA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 8: Completing sign-in with MFA&quot; width=&quot;302&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-8640&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Figure 8: Completing sign-in with MFA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your IAM user has successfully completed the MFA challenge and signed into the AWS Management console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I shared the benefits of using YubiKey security keys as your MFA device. I demonstrated how you can enable a YubiKey security key for your IAM users through the IAM console. I also showed you how to sign into the AWS Management Console using the YubiKey security key associated with your IAM user.

<title>Wasmjit: Kernel Mode WebAssembly Runtime for Linux</title>
<link>https://github.com/rianhunter/wasmjit</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/rianhunter/wasmjit</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmjit is a small embeddable WebAssembly runtime. Its core is written in C90 and is easily portable to most environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its primary target is a Linux kernel module that can host Emscripten-generated WebAssembly modules. In this configuration it runs WebAssembly modules in kernel-space (ring 0) and provides access to system calls as normal function calls. This configuration avoids user-kernel transition overhead, as well as scheduling overheads from swapping page tables. This results in a significant performance increase for syscall-bound programs like web servers or FUSE file systems. The performance increase is more pronounced in a post-Spectre/Meltdown world due to PTI overhead. Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianhunter/wasmjit/master/wasmjit.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rianhunter/wasmjit/master/wasmjit.png&quot; alt=&quot;example wasmjit run&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also includes a host environment for running in user-space on POSIX systems. This is useful for running WebAssembly modules without having to run an entire browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasmjit is licensed under a permissive MIT license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasmjit currently runs on x86_64 POSIX systems, like Linux, macOS, and the BSDs. It can also optionally use a Linux kernel module that can significantly speed up execution. To get started with Wasmjit you need a few tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A standard POSIX C development environment that includes &lt;code&gt;cc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Emscripten SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Your Linux distro's kernel headers. On Debian, install the &lt;code&gt;linux-headers-amd64&lt;/code&gt; package, on Fedora, install &lt;code&gt;kernel-devel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;(Optional) Installing the Kernel Module&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ make modclean
$ make kwasmjit.ko
$ sudo insmod ./kwasmjit.ko
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/wasm # See caveat below
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building the Executable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ make clean
$ make -j wasmjit
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building and running the Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ source path_to_emsdk/emsdk_env.sh # bring emcc into $PATH
$ emcc -o selfpipe.js src/wasmjit_examples/selfpipe.c
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now run the example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ time ./wasmjit selfpipe.wasm
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you installed the Linux kernel module, this should run much quicker than a native binary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cc -o selfpipe src/wasmjit_examples/selfpipe.c
$ time ./selfpipe
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasmjit can run a subset of Emscripten-generated WebAssembly on Linux, macOS, and within the Linux kernel as a kernel module. It currently only supports x86_64. Here are the current developments goals in order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement enough Emscripten host-bindings to run &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lmz3nnz92jx9szh/AAA-YOEHxwM_nki8jX0uFRuqa?dl=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nginx.wasm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement an interpreter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Rust-runtime for Rust-generated wasm files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Go-runtime for Go-generated wasm files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize x86_64 JIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement arm64 JIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement macOS kernel module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRs are welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code and data section allocations are done using &lt;code&gt;vmalloc()&lt;/code&gt;. This prevents those pages from ever being swapped to disk. Thus, indiscriminately allowing access to the &lt;code&gt;/dev/wasm&lt;/code&gt; device may make a system vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. In the future a system-wide limit on the amount of memory used by the &lt;code&gt;/dev/wasm&lt;/code&gt; device will be provided to mitigate that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Maps won&amp;#039;t let you save home address without allowing all Google tracking</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that has been the case for at least months now. E.g., after the outcry of the recent &quot;Google is still tracking location although location tracking is off&quot;, many of my colleagues and myself found this when we deactivated activity tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; record has been broken by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gum4GI2Jr0s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kosmic&lt;/a&gt;, the first human being to ever beat the game in 4 minutes and 55 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a near-perfect run of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; Monday night, speedrunner Kosmic completed the 1985 NES games in stunning fashion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.speedrun.com/smb1#Any&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;breaking the world record&lt;/a&gt; of the any% category with a time of 4:55 and 913 ms. Kosmic beat the record he had just set that same night at 4:56 and 245 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the new world record run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gum4GI2Jr0s?enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;&quot; data-channel=&quot;Kosmicd12&quot; data-template=&quot;embedded&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This run is an extremely impressive feat of precision, memorization, and years of practice. It's so good, in fact, that it is nearly tied with the theoretical best time that can be achieved in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break down what that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After clearing the first level perfectly, nailing the second level, and clipping the wall to warp into the first level of world four, Kosmic says he's &quot;literally tied with the TAS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TAS stands for tool-assisted speedrun, and that's exactly what it sounds like. People can use a tool to program exact inputs in games, which can be used to figure out the best possible time that a game can be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the theoretical fastest time someone can beat &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is 4:54 and 30 ms, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasvideos.org/Game/nes-super-mario-bros.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TASVideos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Kosmic says he's tied with the TAS run at 4-1, that means his inputs are matched up exactly with the program's and he can't physically do any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, Kosmic continues to nail everything almost perfectly, slipping up so minorly that most viewers who aren't familiar with the nuances of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; speedruns won't even recognize when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As YouTuber and speedrunning historian Summoning Salt points out in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdAkY7RfajY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thorough analysis of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; speedruns&lt;/a&gt;, speedrunners have been whittling down the world record for well over a decade. Top runners are at a point where they can only hope to improve their times by shaving off milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as long ago as 2010 that legendary &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; speedrunner AndrewG first hit a sub-5-minute run. Since then, runners have taken turns in the spotlight, slowly perfecting the run over hundreds of attempts. Darbian, who currently holds third place in the Super Mario Bros. any % category with a time of 4:56 and 548 ms, got that time 11 months ago, so you can see how long it takes for these records to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kosmic has been speedrunning &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; and various other games for years, uploading his first &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; run on YouTube six years ago. This record has been a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Java 11 released</title>
<link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/09/java11-released</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/09/java11-released</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Java 11 has arrived. The new release is the first planned appearance of Oracle's long-term support (LTS) releases, although Oracle have also grandfathered in Java 8 as an LTS release to help bridge the gap between the old release model and the new approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature list for the new version has only evolved modestly since InfoQ reported on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/Java2018LookForward&quot;&gt;earlier in the year&lt;/a&gt;, and the major new features in Java 11 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nest-based access controls (aka &quot;Nestmates&quot;): revisits the implementation of inner classes and eliminates the need for compilers to insert bridge methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic class-file constants (aka &quot;condy&quot;): reduces the cost and disruption of creating new forms of materializable class-file constants and opens the door to new performance and platform approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZGC (Experimental): a brand-new garbage collector designed for sub-10ms pause times (even on large heaps) with an aim of no more than a 15% performance penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flight Recorder: low overhead data collection framework for troubleshooting Java applications and the HotSpot JVM, previously a commercial feature, now open-sourced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New standard HTTP library: A new module java.net.http that standardizes the incubating API and allows flow-based HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLS 1.3: Implement the recently standardized new version of Transport Layer Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters: Updating the lambda syntax to use the var type-inferencing introduced in Java 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new release also removes some older features to try to streamline the core Java product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Java EE and CORBA Modules: Require applications to explicitly depend upon EE and CORBA modules if they require them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Start: This feature has been removed with no clear replacement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applets: These have been heavily deprecated for some time and are finally removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaFX: The FX libraries have moved to the OpenJFX project and are removed from the core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the EE modules contain the support for JAXB and SOAP - both components that are still in relatively widespread use in many enterprises. Development teams that upgrade to the new version should check carefully whether they will need to modify their build scripts to take these changes into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georges Saab, Vice President of Software Development in the Java Platform Group at Oracle commented on the new LTS model for Java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LTS model releases enable our customers to migrate from one well-supported Java SE LTS release to the next at their own pace, while at the same time allowing the Java developer ecosystem to get access to improvements faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of the new features can be seen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/java-10-11&quot;&gt;a presentation from earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and some of the new class file format changes (including condy and nestmates) are discussed in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/08/byte-buddy-java11&quot;&gt;interview with Rafael Winterhalter, creator of ByteBuddy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 11 will be available for download from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html&quot;&gt;Oracle's official download site&lt;/a&gt; and from other vendors but at press time the website had yet to be updated. The support model for Java 11 has changed from previous versions, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/09/java-support-options-sept18&quot;&gt;InfoQ has previously reported on the details of the new model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
