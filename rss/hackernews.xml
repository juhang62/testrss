<title>Netflix Saves Kids from Up to 400 Hours of Commercials a Year</title>
<link>https://localbabysitter.com/netflix-saves-our-kids-from-up-to-400-hours-of-commercials-a-year/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://localbabysitter.com/netflix-saves-our-kids-from-up-to-400-hours-of-commercials-a-year/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Even though kids these days are spending more and more times staring into their phones, television screen time is still a dominant source of entertainment for kids 2-11 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way most children are consuming television these days has shifted. Many homes are now “Netflix-only” homes, while others remain more traditional with standard cable packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We calculated a series of numbers related to standard television homes, compared them to Netflix-only homes and found an interesting trend with regard to how many commercials a streaming-only household can save their children from having to watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children 2-5 years old in Netflix-only homes are being saved from over 400 hours of commercials a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children 6-11 years old in Netflix-only homes are being saved from over 360 hours of commercials a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;study conducted by the University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; found that kids 2-5 spend an average of 32 hours per week in front of a television set. Children 6-11 spend 28 hours in front of a television set (there are some who believe the decrease between brackets is likely due to the slightly older kids now transitioning to phone time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average 2-5 year old is spending over 1,600 hours a year watching television.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average 6-11 year old is spending over 1,450 hours a year watching television.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ratings tracking company Nielsen reported in 2014 that the average hour of television has close to 15 minutes and 30 seconds of commercials&lt;/a&gt;. If calculated out over the above annual totals, both age brackets are saved from hundreds of hours of commercials every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, among others, have children’s entertainment options that offer commercial-free consumption of both educational and entertaining television. Think of all the hours of wacky toys and sugary cereal young children are being spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course it’s worth discussing YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is becoming fairly normal for kids as early as their toddler years to be watching YouTube for several hours a day. And while parents can get an ad-free experience through services like YouTube Red, most don’t (and even with YouTube Red, kids can still watch content from advertisers like toy company YouTube channels or unboxing videos, which are essentially toy ads as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we couldn’t find any specific data on whether or not a child in a home with standard television versus Netflix-only options watches more YouTube, we’re willing to bet the numbers are probably fairly equal. Kids love YouTube, and advertisers are throwing billions of dollars every year at the service to get their products in front of young audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also curious, as children of the 90s ourselves, does a child who grew up without a continual bombardment of ads end up more susceptible to advertising later in life? Did those early days of being shown ad after ad for LIFE Cereal end up turning us all into advertising cynics? No data yet on this, but something we’ll definitely be paying close attention to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ZombieLoad: Cross Privilege-Boundary Data Leakage on Intel CPUs</title>
<link>https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2019-05-14-zombieload.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2019-05-14-zombieload.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;ZombieLoad is a novel category of side-channel attacks which we refer to as &lt;strong&gt;data-sampling attack&lt;/strong&gt;. It demonstrates that faulting load instructions can transiently expose private values of one Hyperthread sibling to the other. This new exploit is the result of a collaboration between Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss and Moritz Lipp from Graz University of Technology, Thomas Prescher and Julian Stecklina from Cyberus Technology, Jo Van Bulck from KU Leuven, and Daniel Moghimi from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we summarize the implications and shed light on the different attack scenarios across CPU privilege rings, OS processes, virtual machines, and SGX enclaves, and give advice over possible ways to mitigate such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short summary of what this security vulnerability means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;By exploiting the CPU’s so-called bypass logic on return values of loads, it is possible to &lt;strong&gt;leak data across processes, privilege boundaries, Hyperthreads&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as values that are loaded inside &lt;strong&gt;Intel SGX enclaves&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;between VMs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code utilizing this exploit works on Windows, Linux, etc., as this is not a software- but a hardware issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to retrieve content that is currently being used by a Hyperthread sibling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even without Hyperthreading, it is possible to leak data out of other protection domains. During experimentation it turned out, that ZombieLoad leaks endure serializing instructions. Such leaks do however work with lower probability and are harder to obtain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is an &lt;em&gt;implementation detail&lt;/em&gt; what kind of data is processed after a faulty read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Spectre v1 gadgets, potentially any value in memory can be leaked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affected software:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far all versions of all operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS, BSDs, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All hypervisors (VMWare, Microsoft HyperV, KVM, Xen, Virtualbox, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All container solutions (Docker, LXC, OpenVZ, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code that uses secure &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions&quot;&gt;SGX&lt;/a&gt; enclaves in order to protect critical data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affected CPUs:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel &lt;strong&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Xeon&lt;/strong&gt; CPUs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPUs with Meltdown/L1TF mitigations are affected by fewer variants of this attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were unable to reproduce this behavior on non-Intel CPUs and consider it likely that this is an implementation issue affecting only Intel CPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sole operating system/hypervisor software patches do not suffice for complete mitigation:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2018-08-14-l1-terminal-fault.html&quot;&gt;L1TF exploit&lt;/a&gt;, effective mitigations require switching off SMT (Simultaneous MultiThreading, aka Hyperthreads) or making sure that trusted and untrusted code do not share physical cores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about exploits like Meltdown/Spectre/ZombieLoad and their derivatives, their impact, or the involvement of Cyberus Technology GmbH, please contact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-attacks&quot;&gt;Example Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present two example attacks that are both mounted on a browser as the victim process. The browser leaking its data runs in one Hyperthread and the adversary application disclosing the values runs as sibling thread on the same physical core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;url-recovery&quot;&gt;URL Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, we reconstruct URLs that are being visited by the victim browser process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/assets/images/posts/zombieload/example_attack_on_browser.png&quot; alt=&quot;An unprivileged attacker with the ability to execute code can reconstruct URLs being visited in Firefox.&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An unprivileged attacker with the ability to execute code can reconstruct URLs being visited in Firefox.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its basic form, the attacker has no control over the leaked data i.e., it is necessary to filter for interesting data. Hence, our adversary app searches for typical URL prefixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, e.g., session cookies or credit card numbers follow predictable patterns in memory, hence represent a realistic target for such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;keyword-detection&quot;&gt;Keyword Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, we constantly sample data using ZombieLoad and match leaked values against a list of predefined keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;/assets/videos/posts/zombieload/tails-demo.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;
You should see a video of our POC exploit, but your browser does not support the video tag. &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
The adversary application prints keywords whenever the victim browser process handles data that matches the list of adversary keywords.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the video shows a browser that runs inside a VM: ZombieLoad leaks across sibling Hyperthreads regardless of virtual machine boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-background&quot;&gt;Technical Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: ZombieLoad is a transient-execution attack that observes the values of memory loads on the current physical core from a sibling thread. It exploits that the memory subsystem is shared among the logical cores of a physical core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;simultaneous-multithreading-hyperthreading&quot;&gt;Simultaneous Multithreading / Hyperthreading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;yper&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;hreading&lt;/a&gt; is Intel’s implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;imultaneous &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;ulti&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;hreading&lt;/a&gt;, both are also usually abbreviated as HT and SMT. This section explains the value of HT/SMT for the performance and power efficiency of modern CPUs, and also why it imposes security risks that are exposed by the discovery of ZombieLoad (and similarly by L1TF/Foreshadow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMT boosts the CPU’s instruction throughput by increasing the utilization of the independent execution units that exist within the pipeline. Already without SMT, the CPU architecture is capable of decomposing the instruction sequence into operations like loads, stores, and calculations. For different kinds of operations the CPU has different execution units (EUs). EUs that are in high demand are replicated. Operations that do not depend on each other can be processed in parallel by the corresponding EUs. The higher their utilization, the higher the overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In program sequences with too many dependencies between operations, a lot of EUs might end up idling. SMT further increases CPU utilization by running two threads concurrently on one physical core. Processing two instruction streams increases the probability of finding independent operations to assign to the available EUs that might otherwise sit idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/assets/images/posts/zombieload/smt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Execution unit utilization without vs. with simultaneous multithreading&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Execution unit utilization without vs. with simultaneous multithreading&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagram shows an example load of two threads that both individually do not fully utilize the CPU’s EUs. Arrows show dependencies between the operations and blocks with alphabetic suffix model operations that take more than one CPU cycle. Complex arithmetic, for example, requires more time, and memory values are always not immediately available. With SMT enabled, the CPU’s EUs can be fully utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If SMT is enabled, the operating system sees two independent CPUs where only one physical core exists. Such &lt;em&gt;logical cores&lt;/em&gt; each have their private &lt;em&gt;architectural state&lt;/em&gt;, but they share most of their execution resources - which is one of the reasons why SMT greatly improves energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/assets/images/posts/zombieload/st_mt_modes.png&quot; alt=&quot;State Sharing between logical CPU cores in multithreading mode&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;State Sharing between logical CPU cores in multithreading mode&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second diagram visualizes how some parts of a physical core’s resources are shared between two logical cores if it is run in multithreading (MT) mode. If one of the cores is currently not operating (e.g., after executing a &lt;code&gt;halt&lt;/code&gt; instruction) or Hyperthreading is deactivated, all resources belong to the only running logical core (see modes ST0 and ST1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the operating system schedules two threads from completely different applications on the logical cores of the same physical core, data of both applications is processed at the same time in the shared execution resources. ZombieLoad exploits this circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;transient-execution-of-faulting-reads&quot;&gt;Transient Execution of Faulting Reads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPUs maximize execution unit utilization by speculating when it is unclear what has to be done next: Conditional jumps that depend on values that are yet to be calculated are an example, because it cannot be known for sure in advance if the jump shall be taken or not. If the speculation is wrong, the pipeline rolls back all wrongly performed operations and ensures that none of their results become visible outside the CPU so that the system stays in a correct state. Otherwise, if the speculation is right (which just needs to be “most of the time”), the CPU’s degree of utilization, and hence its performance, was successfully increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions that are executed speculatively or out-of-order but whose results are never committed to architectural state are called &lt;strong&gt;transient instructions&lt;/strong&gt;. Any fault that occurs during transient execution of an instruction is handled when the instruction &lt;em&gt;retires&lt;/em&gt;, the last pipeline stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an instruction stream depends on a value from a read operation that turns out to trigger a fault of some kind, the vulnerable CPUs speculatively use &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; value placeholder during transient execution. Such faults may be of architectural (e.g., exceptions) or of microarchitectural nature (e.g., updates of accessed/dirty bits in the page table). Normally, this does not present a problem, because the effects of this calculation will never leave the retire phase. By using side channels like the CPU cache subsystem (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2018-01-03-meltdown.html&quot;&gt;our article about Meltdown&lt;/a&gt; explains this in detail), this placeholder value can be extracted by an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-attack&quot;&gt;The Attack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZombieLoad enables four different attack scenarios. All of them have in common that they trigger a faulty read, and extract data used by transiently executed operations via a side-channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already stated in the technical background section, operations that depend on the value of a faulty read operation may be executed transiently with wrong data. It is an &lt;em&gt;implementation detail&lt;/em&gt; what kind of data is processed during that time window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that on Intel processors this wrong data may be data from &lt;strong&gt;outside the current process&lt;/strong&gt; but still loaded by the physical CPU core for whatever reason, which can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;data from kernel space or other applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data from outside the VM: other VM or hypervisor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data from inside a currently executing SGX enclave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important detail is that the attacker has no direct control over what data is read here. Leaked data could be uninteresting because it comes from an irrelevant other process, VM, etc. If it comes from the right process, it might still be the wrong data, because the address from which the data is returned is beyond the attacker’s control. (In Meltdown or L1TF, on the other hand, the attacker &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; the address.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this restriction, the class of attacks that ZombieLoad enables is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;data-sampling attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. The attacker simply samples leaking data that is currently being used by the victim process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;attack-scenarios&quot;&gt;Attack Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different attack scenarios are described in the following, accompanied with attacker model and example scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These attack scenarios can be enhanced in a way that gives the attacker control over the addresses from which data is leaked. In order to achieve that, they can be combined with the use of Spectre-v1 gadgets which lead the CPU into prefetching interesting data from specific addresses. We are going to mention where this can be useful, but will not go into detail as this goes beyond the scope of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;cross-process-user-space-leakage&quot;&gt;Cross-Process User Space Leakage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the attacker executes unprivileged code on one logical CPU core, while a victim application runs on the other logical (but same physical) core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim application could be a browser or password manager application which contains secrets. While the victim application is dealing with interesting data, the attacker triggers faulty read operations in his own thread and samples leaked data from the victim process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker has no control over the address from which data is leaked, therefore it is necessary to know &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the victim application handles the interesting data. For example, if the attacker is looking for AES keys, he can use the fact that shared libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; are usually used for encryption and decryption. By flushing the sections of the shared AES encryption/decryption routines out of the cache, the attacker thread can sample the access times for such addresses - they would suddenly go down in case the victim process started executing such code again. This is the moment in which the probability of leaking (parts) of the AES keys rises and the data-sampling attack can be started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;intel-sgx-leakage&quot;&gt;Intel SGX Leakage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim code that utilizes SGX and the attacker code are assumed to be run on the same physical core, but different logical core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGX’s typical threat model assumes that enclaves are still secure, even if the attacker has full control over the surrounding operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under such conditions, ZombieLoad allows for leaking data of running secure enclave code with the same strategy as in the cross-process user space leakage attack scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;virtual-machine-leakage&quot;&gt;Virtual Machine Leakage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the cross-process user space leakage scenario, attacker code and victim code run on the same physical but different logical core. In this scenario, both attacker and victim may run on individual virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker might for example upload and run a prepared guest image on a cloud hosting service where the VMs of other customers are co-located in order to leak their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;kernel-leakage-without-hyperthreading&quot;&gt;Kernel Leakage without Hyperthreading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with Hyperthreading disabled, ZombieLoad allows to leak data from other protection domains on the same logical core. If a faulty read leaks data during transient execution, this data may also originate from kernel space. Such an attack would be mounted after transitions between kernel space and user space, e.g., return paths from system calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacks of this class are much harder to mount because the return paths from such other protection domains to the user space/VM are less likely to leak interesting values. One reason for this are serializing instructions which do not prevent leakage in general, but reduce the amount of leaking memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to trigger leaks from interesting memory addresses, the attacker could combine the use of Spectre-style gadgets prior to mounting a ZombieLoad attack. Such gadgets may be hard to find on the return paths to user space/VM. They could, however, be deliberately installed in proprietary software in order to provide backdoors, and would be very hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cross-vm-covert-channel&quot;&gt;Cross-VM Covert Channel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an attack scenario per se, or at least a very different one compared to the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ZombieLoad as a covert channel, two VMs could communicate with each other even in scenarios where they are configured in a way that forbids direct interaction between them. For example, isolation policies could be in place such that one VM offers unrestricted Internet access (watching YouTube videos) while the other has access to the corporate network, only (reading confidential documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitigation-techniques&quot;&gt;Mitigation Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safest workaround to prevent this extremely powerful attack is running trusted and untrusted applications on &lt;strong&gt;different physical machines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is not feasible in given contexts, &lt;strong&gt;disabling Hyperthreading&lt;/strong&gt; completely represents the safest mitigation. This does not, however, close the door on attacks on system call return paths that leak data from kernel space to user space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case disabling HT is not feasible for performance or other reasons, trusted and untrusted processes should never be scheduled on the same physical core. This, again, does not mitigate all attacker scenarios, because adversary processes could still leak data from the super ordinated kernel or hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more detailed information about mitigation vectors, please consult the ZombieLoad research paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has cut more than 23,000 jobs since receiving a big tax cut at the end of 2017, despite lobbying heavily for the tax cut by claiming that it would create thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/att_to_invest_an_additional_1_billion_in_the_united_states_if_competitive_tax_rate_enacted.html&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T in November 2017&lt;/a&gt; pushed for the corporate tax cut by promising to invest an additional $1 billion in 2018, with CEO Randall Stephenson &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atandt-ceo-says-theyll-invest-least-1-billion-create-7000-jobs-tax-reform-passes-200245187.html&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;every billion dollars AT&amp;amp;T invests is 7,000 hard-hat jobs. These are not entry-level jobs. These are 7,000 jobs of people putting fiber in ground, hard-hat jobs that make $70,000 to $80,000 per year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate tax cut was subsequently passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017. The tax cut &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-sees-big-benefit-from-tax-law-1517434789&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; gave AT&amp;amp;T an extra $3 billion in cash in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But AT&amp;amp;T cut capital spending and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/att-sued-over-layoffs-after-promising-more-investment-because-of-tax-cut/&quot;&gt;kept laying people off&lt;/a&gt; after the tax cut. A union analysis of AT&amp;amp;T's publicly available financial statements &quot;shows the telecom company eliminated 23,328 jobs since the Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed in late 2017, including nearly 6,000 in the first quarter of 2019,&quot; the Communications Workers of America (CWA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/att-cut-over-23000-jobs-congress-passed-tax-bill&quot;&gt;said yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T's total employment was 254,000 as of December 31, 2017 and rose to &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/1q-2019/1Q19_Trending%20Schedules.pdf&quot;&gt;262,290 by March 31, 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But AT&amp;amp;T's overall workforce increased only because of its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. and two smaller companies, which together added 31,618 employees during 2018, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/annual-reports/2018/2019-notice-of-annual-meeting-and-proxy-statement.pdf&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T proxy statement&lt;/a&gt; cited in the CWA report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding employees gained via mergers, AT&amp;amp;T's workforce dropped from 254,000 to 230,672, a cut of 23,328 jobs, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/20190508-cwa-att-jobs-report-update.pdf&quot;&gt;CWA report&lt;/a&gt; points out. These numbers are for AT&amp;amp;T's global workforce, but the vast majority of its employees are in the US. AT&amp;amp;T reported having 44,892 non-US employees as of October 1, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent layoffs affected 368 union technicians in California, the CWA &lt;a href=&quot;https://district9.cwa-union.org/news/releases/despite-promises-att-announces-california-layoffs&quot;&gt;said last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also cut more than 10,000 jobs each year in 2016 and 2017. AT&amp;amp;T had 281,450 employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/annual-reports/2016/att-ar2016-completefinancialreview.pdf&quot;&gt;as of December 31, 2015&lt;/a&gt;, 268,540 as of December 31, 2016, and 254,000 by the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T slashed capital spending, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;AT&amp;amp;T's annual report also shows the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-executives-pay-climbed-after-media-takeover-11552347851&quot;&gt;boosted executive pay&lt;/a&gt; and suggests that after refunds, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/20190325-att-gop-tax-cuts.pdf&quot;&gt;it paid no cash income taxes in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and slashed capital investments by $1.4 billion,&quot; the CWA wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T reported $21.6 billion in capital expenses in &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/att_fourth_quarter_earnings_2017.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and $21.3 billion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/2019/att_fourth_quarter_earnings_2018.html&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, a cut of $300 million. CWA told Ars that the cut is $1.4 billion when &quot;excluding federal government reimbursements for the construction of FirstNet,&quot; AT&amp;amp;T's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/att-gets-6-5-billion-to-build-us-wide-public-safety-network/&quot;&gt;government-funded public safety network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T capital spending is already down more than $900 million this year, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/1q-2019/1Q19%20Investor%20Briefing.pdf&quot;&gt;the telco reported&lt;/a&gt; Q1 2019 capital expenditures of $5.18 billion, down from $6.12 billion in Q2 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What AT&amp;amp;T is doing to hardworking people across America is disgraceful,&quot; CWA President Chris Shelton said in the union announcement. &quot;Congress needs to investigate AT&amp;amp;T to find out how it is using its tax windfall since the company's own publicly available data already raise serious alarm bells. AT&amp;amp;T got its tax cut. Where are the jobs?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T's actual capital spending of $21.3 billion in 2018 is far short of what AT&amp;amp;T told investors to expect at the beginning of 2018, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/att_fourth_quarter_earnings_2017.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that full-year capital spending would &quot;approach&quot; $25 billion and be &quot;$23 billion net of expected FirstNet reimbursements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T cuts jobs in “declining” business units&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contacted by Ars, AT&amp;amp;T didn't deny any of the CWA's findings about job cuts. &quot;We continue to hire in areas where we're seeing increasing demand for products and services, but technology is changing rapidly, and that affects hiring and employment,&quot; AT&amp;amp;T told Ars. &quot;There are fewer jobs in parts of the business that are declining and facing technology shifts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also said that it &quot;recently opened new 500-seat call centers in Chicago; Houston; Sunrise, Fla.; and Mesa, Ariz. and that &quot;[m]ost of the jobs at these call centers will be filled by union-represented employees.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said it takes several steps to keep existing employees despite lowering its overall workforce. AT&amp;amp;T said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work very hard to keep employees through these transitions: through normal attrition when possible, follow-the-work offers (frequently with a relocation allowance), internal job-matching programs, and voluntary severance offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many union-represented employees have a job offer guarantee that ensures they are offered another job with the company if their current job is eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we wrote about AT&amp;amp;T layoffs &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/att-reportedly-plans-layoffs-despite-tax-cut-and-fcc-deregulation/&quot;&gt;in January this year&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T told Ars that &quot;we hired more than 20,000 new employees last year and more than 17,000 the year before.&quot; But the company's financial statements make it clear that new hirings fell far short of job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While AT&amp;amp;T responds to criticism of its massive job cuts with boasts about hiring, hiring to address turnover is not the same as job creation,&quot; the CWA said yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YouTube “Let&amp;#039;s Play”s are preserving video game history</title>
<link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/05/06/how-youtube-lets-plays-are-preserving-video-game-history/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/05/06/how-youtube-lets-plays-are-preserving-video-game-history/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;&lt;nav class=&quot;breadcrumb&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;details&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;Please, no take downs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-grid count-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wp-content/themes/rps-2018/images/feature-icon@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;Featured post&quot; class=&quot;icon&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-lightboxed=&quot;false&quot; data-original=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/04/City-Of-Heroes-Freedom.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/04/City-Of-Heroes-Freedom.jpg/RPSS/resize/760x-1/format/jpg/quality/90&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1279&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-672563&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a long-observed fact that the phenomenon of the YouTube let’s play has benefits beyond just entertaining viewers and gradually introducing teenagers to neo-Nazism via YouTube’s algorithm. For developers, for example, getting a popular YouTuber to play their latest title can be a significant boost to sales. Ryan Clark, developer of roguelike rhythm game Crypt of the Necrodancer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/technology/personaltech/using-youtube-as-an-accelerant-for-video-games.html&quot;&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that he had seen a $60,000 boost in sales after PewDiePie showcased his game. What gets overlooked is the (perhaps unwitting) contribution these YouTubers are making to the preservation of video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While let’s plays are unquestionably not preserving the game itself, they can function as secondary documentation, and preserve the cultural impact of a game as well as the community that built up around it. They are perhaps best described as a game’s cultural footprint, rather than the beast itself. In some cases, that footprint is the most readily available form of a game, as in the case of P.T.. It was famously removed from the Playstation store following the cancellation of Silent Hills, and despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/07/15/silent-hills-loses-p-t-fan-remake-gains-a-book-and-fallout-4-mod/&quot;&gt;several fan attempts to remake it on PC&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube remains the best place to experience it now it’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken McAllister, co-founder of video game archival group the Learning Games Initiative (LGI) endorses the idea of walkthroughs and YouTube-style let’s plays as forms of secondary documentation, vital to any preservation efforts. “There are all kinds of ways of preserving these things,” said McAllister. “Some involve biochemistry where you’re trying to preserve the materials, like textiles and wood and plastic, and those kinds of scientific endeavours. And then there’s times where you’re preserving how people play, where you’re shooting both from behind and at the player. You’re not only capturing gameplay but you’re capturing game style and game reaction, and all of those things will teach future researchers what games mean. That’s super important. and certainly these videos preserve how we will understand and remember the impact of games later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube videos can be heavily edited, cutting out the more tedious elements of the game and getting straight to the action, or to the best reaction from the player. While yes, this can often reflect the core experience of the game, it doesn’t give a full picture. If you rip out all the pages of existential angst and whining from Hamlet and jump straight to him stabbing motherfuckers, you lose the understanding of the full experience. Youtubers are often driven by trends, covering the most exciting parts of the biggest games at the time. This runs the risk of smaller games being forgotten, but it’s useful to reflect what was dominating gaming culture at a given time and why. And, as McAllister notes, the players themselves are key to understanding the game’s cultural footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fH0thrqa2Ww&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use P.T. as an example again (which is slightly naughty on a PC only site) streamer Soapywarpig archived her &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/YkKp4PVm7EU&quot;&gt;entire stream on her YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. While the videos preserve how a game looked and operated, it’s the reaction of the player that documents the culture that builds up around the title. Soapywarpig was the first streamer to reveal the surprise announcement at the end of PT, and her genuine excitement at reaching the end of the game and seeing the twist reveal of Silent Hills, is a major part of understanding why PT was so influential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genuine nature of her excitement is important too. YouTube gaming in particular is prone to hyperbole and rehearsed reactions. Soapywarpig’s glee reflects not only the genuinely unexpected Silent Hills announcement as a point in video game history, but preserves the experience games such as these exist to create: joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s plays preserve games in ways that simply archiving the software itself does not. Any attempt to preserve online games in particular runs into the problem of how to preserve the community around a game once the fan base has moved on. A defunct MMORPG can be saved on a private server, as in the case of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/04/16/city-of-heroes-invite-only-fan-server-revealed-by-player/&quot;&gt;secret City Of Heroes server&lt;/a&gt; that was recently snitched on, but the player base that was fundamental to the experience of the game cannot be archived in the same way. Videos made by and about the community, however, can serve as important documents to preserve the spirit of many games of this type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a viewpoint that Jerome McDonough, an Associate Professor at the School of Information Sciences at the iSchool of Illinois describes. “What interests people about games such as MMORPGS, for the most part, is the human interaction going on there,” said McDonough. “The only way to capture that is through documentation, such as YouTube videos and fan websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/04/City-Of-Heroes.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-lightboxed=&quot;false&quot; data-original=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/04/City-Of-Heroes.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/04/City-Of-Heroes.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-672575&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Newman, co-founder of the National Videogame Archive (NVA) thinks that the real value of let’s plays is in suggesting a model for game preservation. Newman’s approach to games preservation is perhaps controversial, stepping away from direct preservation of games themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My position is one that shifts away from a predominantly software preservation-based approach,” said Newman, “and towards an approach that recognises the central importance of play in constituting the object of our interest. It’s a shift from game preservation to gameplay preservation. I want to ensure that we have a good record of how games were played.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newman said that it’s counter intuitive to think that capturing footage of a game turns it from something dynamic into something somehow more static or frozen. “Once you have a sequence of gameplay captured as video you can do things with it that are hard or even impossible during the moment of play,” he explained. “You can freeze frame, rewind, zoom in… In short, you have available the language and grammar of video editing at your disposal. You can scrutinise what’s happening in new ways. You can overlay information, annotate, compare different versions and sequences. The play isn’t absent, the play is right there. Just because games have to be played or co-created doesn’t mean it’s me that has to do the playing!” The NVA calls these particular exhibits “Game Inspectors”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their benefits to game preservation, YouTube let’s plays, much like many aspects of video game preservation, exist in a complicated legal situation. When you hear “DMCA” it refers to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which gives a game’s copyright owners the right to issue those DMCA takedown orders. YouTube videos can preserve the social impact and community of video games, they can themselves disappear without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some copyright owners have been eager to cooperate with YouTubers — Devolver Digital has a page on their website specifically to tell YouTubers and streamers that they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://canipostandmonetizevideosofdevolvergames.com/&quot;&gt;free to stream and monetise Devolver video games&lt;/a&gt; — not all publishers have been so willing. Because the modern world moves faster than the legal system, it’s not entirely clear if the inclusion of the YouTuber’s reactions and commentary amounts to fair use or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are certainly some definitive Let’s Plays that are significant in their own right, and I would want to ensure were preserved,” said Newman. “Given that platforms such as Twitch and YouTube are privately-owned companies, that these videos are currently available does not guarantee their future availability.” He believes that web archiving is going to be an important tool in the game preservation arsenal, which is why the NVA has worked with the British Library to capture key materials that currently only exist online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/12/firewatch-a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-lightboxed=&quot;false&quot; data-original=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/12/firewatch-a.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/12/firewatch-a.jpg/RPSS/resize/690x-1/format/jpg/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2409&quot; height=&quot;1358&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-625405&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most high profile case of a DMCA takedown notice being issued to a YouTuber over a game is PewDiePie receiving a strike from Campo Santo. The Firewatch developers objected to Pewd’s most recent heated gaming moment of the time (i.e.: racism). &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vanaman/status/906984060215427072&quot;&gt;Sean Vanaman Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; at the time that he was “sick of this child getting more and more chances to make money off of what we make”, but also acknowledged they were complicit in the situation, since they had surely made money from the video, which had almost 6 million views. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/09/20/steam-review-bombs/&quot;&gt;Firewatch was review bombed on Steam&lt;/a&gt; followed the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few are willing to test the legality of this situation. While some publishers are notorious for issuing DMCA takedowns, or demonetising videos featuring their games, the full tensile strength of let’s plays has yet to be tested in court. Nobody seems to want to be the one to risk ruining a mutually beneficial relationship by setting a legal precedent. That Campo Santo situation illustrates the tricky legal area that let’s plays exist in. While the Firewatch DMCA was motivated by the honourable goal of telling Pewdiepie to go fuck himself, it also shows that these videos can be taken down at the whim of the copyright holder. If a publisher wishes all traces of a game to be removed, they theoretically have the power to do so. It’s unfortunate that currently let’s plays can disappear just as easily as the games they depict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, YouTube’s value for preserving games is complicated. Not only can the videos themselves disappear at any moment, but the extent to which they preserve the true experience of these games is questionable. Preservation of this kind isn’t a perfect science. At its best you’ll find streamers like Soapywarpig, who perfectly encapsulates the impact a lost game made on gaming culture, but sometimes it’s more akin to a confused summary written in sand by a racist child. Even in their current state let’s plays are an important part of video game history, so it’s probably an idea to look at how we can improve that currently imperfect science.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Erlang OTP 22.0 is released</title>
<link>http://www.erlang.org/news/132</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.erlang.org/news/132</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Erlang/OTP 22 is a new major release with new features and improvements as well as incompatibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a deeper dive into the highlights of the OTP 22 release, you can read our blog here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.erlang.org/OTP-22-Highlights/&quot;&gt;http://blog.erlang.org/OTP-22-Highlights/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Incompatibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;gen_* behaviours: If logging of the last N messages through &lt;span&gt;sys:log/2,3&lt;/span&gt; is active for the server, this log is included in the terminate report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reltool: A new element, Opts, can now be included in a rel tuple in the reltool release specific configuration format: &lt;span&gt;{rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All external pids/ports/refs created by &lt;span&gt;erlang:list_to_pid&lt;/span&gt; and similar functions now compare equal to any other pid/port/ref with same number from that node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old legacy &lt;span&gt;erl_interface&lt;/span&gt; library is deprecated as of OTP 22, and will be removed in OTP 23. This does not apply to the &lt;span&gt;ei&lt;/span&gt; library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erts:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large messages into several fragments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it yields when called with long lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new (still experimental) module &lt;span&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; is introduced. It is implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as &quot;close as possible&quot; to the OS level socket interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the NIF function &lt;span&gt;enif_term_type&lt;/span&gt;, which helps avoid long sequences of &lt;span&gt;enif_is_xyz&lt;/span&gt; by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Compiler:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support. If &lt;span&gt;erlc&lt;/span&gt; is invoked with the &lt;span&gt;+native&lt;/span&gt; option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standard libraries:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode. The increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, as an example the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple socket API is provided through the &lt;span&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt; module. This is a low level API that does *not* replace &lt;span&gt;gen_[tcp|udp|sctp]&lt;/span&gt;. It is intended to *eventually* replace the inet driver. It also provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of other protocols than TCP, UDP and SCTP. Known issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently), a small term leakage. This feature will be classed as experimental in OTP 22.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL: now uses the new logger API, including log levels and verbose debug logging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Server for experimental use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crypto: The new &lt;span&gt;hash_info/1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;cipher_info/1&lt;/span&gt; functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Walmart announces next-day delivery, firing back at Amazon</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;70.281926029309&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart is firing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest retailer in the world will now offer shoppers the option to have their online orders delivered the next day, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which on April 25 announced plans to spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/amazon-spending-800-mln-to-make-free-one-day-shipping-prime-default.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;$800 million during the second quarter for one-day delivery for all Amazon Prime members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; said Tuesday it is rolling out next-day delivery in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Southern California over the next few days and will expand it to reach roughly 75% of American consumers by the end of 2019, including 40 of the top 50 major metros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon hasn't yet detailed a timeline for its own rollout of next-day shipping. But even before its April announcement, the company had offered same-day and two-hour delivery for Prime members in certain markets for certain products and at an additional cost. Amazon's next-day shipping plan expands the number of items and ZIP codes eligible for expedited service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart isn't disclosing the cost of its latest delivery push. But the company says it has been working on it for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, Walmart started offering free, two-day shipping for orders totaling more than $35, lowering its minimum purchase threshold from $50. It had already bought Jet.com for $3 billion in 2016 to juice its online business and compete with Amazon. That deal helped it reach shoppers in bigger cities, like New York, in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been working on this for the past several years,&quot; Marc Lore, head of Walmart's e-commerce business in the U.S., said about the move toward next-day shipping. &quot;We've been investing ... and now we are in the position to reap the benefits.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, next-day delivery will be available for about 220,000 items &quot;most frequently purchased&quot; online, Walmart said, including toys and electronics. The company said it plans to make more items available to ship next day over time. And the option is only free for orders over $35. Amazon, for comparison, has no minimum purchase threshold for free, next-day delivery but requires customers to have a Prime membership, which costs $119 annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the future of the Walmart.com supply chain,&quot; Lore said. &quot;The more products we add to this experience ... the more profitable the orders will be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Amazon made its one-day shipping the new standard for all Prime customers last month it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/amazons-free-one-day-shipping-puts-the-pressure-on-walmart-target.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;sent shares of Walmart and Target tumbling,&lt;/a&gt; as investors worried bricks-and-mortar retailers would now have to spend more money to match the e-commerce giant's steps. Walmart's stock price was up 0.5% in Tuesday's premarket. Amazon shares were 1% higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's this nebulous thing called the Amazon effect,&quot; said John Bonno, managing director in the retail practice at AlixPartners. &quot;I think retailers are so afraid. ... [They're] so nervous that any new service that Amazon offers, retailers feel they need to go through hoops,&quot; to match it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy online, pick up at the store&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;22.807262569832&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Walmart and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TGT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; have something Amazon doesn't — networks of thousands of stores across the country. Stores help these companies offer a click-and-collect option, where a customer can place an order online, drive to the store, and pick it up the same day. Walmart, for example, says it's on track to offer pickup for online grocery orders at 3,100 stores and same-day grocery delivery from 1,600 locations by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Walmart wants to make the promise they are doing everything they can to be as convenient as possible,&quot; said Laura Kennedy, a retail analyst for consulting group Kantar. &quot;They have to meet shoppers' expectations. ... Amazon has set those for the last 10 to 15 years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;40.157353885678&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent report from UBS estimated it would cost Walmart $215 million in incremental investments, based on the company's e-commerce revenues, to match Amazon's one-day shipping offering. UBS added this would be &quot;quite manageable&quot; for Walmart to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lore had told analysts during a meeting last fall that Walmart was already capable of reaching 87% of the country with next-day delivery. Amazon is already capable of offering same-day and one-day delivery to 72% of the U.S. population, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/05/amazon-can-already-ship-to-72percent-of-us-population-in-a-day-map-shows.html&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;according to RBC Capital Markets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lore said the push toward one-day delivery ultimately makes &quot;good business sense&quot; for Walmart. He said this means shoppers will start to receive all of their items in one box — because with next-day delivery, each order is going to be sourced from the nearest distribution center, and only that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a shopper wants a pack of diapers, a Star Wars toy, a coffee mug and a pair of headphones delivered the next day, for example, all of these items will need to be available at one warehouse. If one item isn't available, the shopper will be presented with the option to &quot;save it for later,&quot; and order the others for the following day. Or, the shopper can still order everything — likely receiving the shipment in multiple boxes — for two-day delivery, or beyond. (Cut-off times for next-day deliveries will vary by market, Walmart said.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart has done &quot;extensive work&quot; to make sure it has the right items at the right fulfillment centers, Lore said. The company isn't planning to source next-day shipments from its stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a fad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; readability=&quot;65.123393316195&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is buying into next-day delivery being the next big thing for retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Walmart finds out this effort isn't profitable, the company will stop offering it, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She compared it to when Amazon started offering overnight delivery on shoes to compete with Zappos.com. Then Amazon bought Zappos. &quot;It was an unsustainable arms race ... and eventually they just stopped,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Something like next-day delivery is a short-term burst of excitement. It's great for shoppers. ... Customers win when Walmart and Amazon are duking it out. But is it long term?&quot; Kodali asked. &quot;At the macro-economic level, it's not sustainable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she thinks more retailers should lean into offering buy-online-pick-up-in-store options, utilizing their real estate and saving on shipping expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent survey from Coresight Research found 46% of online shoppers in the U.S. had picked up an internet order from a bricks-and-mortar store in the past 12 months. The top retailers with this option were Walmart, Target, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BBY&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HD&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;Home Depot&lt;/a&gt;, Coresight said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Consumers actually like shopping [with click and collect],&quot; Kodali said. Retailers &quot;should've realized this years ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; which offers free, two-day shipping for all of its credit card holders, with no minimum purchase requirement &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; now has a curbside pickup option for shoppers at over 1,250 stores. It offers in-store pickup for online orders at all of its 1,850 locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon, still in its race to get boxes to customers as fast as possible, said Monday it will start giving its current employees up to $10,000 in start-up costs to quit their jobs and form businesses delivering Amazon packages. If accepted into the program, the delivery helpers will be able to lease vans from Amazon. The offer is open to most part- and full-time Amazon employees, but not to Whole Foods workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon shares are up about 21% so far this year, while Walmart shares are up 7%, and Target shares have climbed about 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— CNBC's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/michael-bloom/&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; role=&quot;&quot; tabindex=&quot;&quot; data-type=&quot;&quot; aria-label=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;contributed to this reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: This article was revised to clarify that Amazon plans to spend $800 million for its one-day delivery program for Prime members. An earlier version was unclear. Walmart isn't disclosing the cost of its latest delivery push.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Rückzugsorte – Map of areas in Berlin which are the furthest away from a street</title>
<link>http://hanshack.com/rueckzugsorte/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://hanshack.com/rueckzugsorte/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Info&lt;/h3&gt;
Kann man in einer Großstadt dem Verkehr überhaupt entkommen? Mit dieser Karte kannst du die Berliner Orte erkunden, die am weitesten abseits von Straßen liegen. Wenn du weiter hinein zoomst, findest du auch Cafés, Bars und Restaurants, die mindestens 50 Meter von einer Straße entfernt liegen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methodik&lt;/h4&gt;
Die Rückzugsorte wurden auf Ebene der Straßenblocks berechnet, das sind Flächen, die komplett von Straßen umgeben sind.&lt;br/&gt;Die Daten basieren auf OpenStreetMap. Der Datensatz beinhaltet alle Straßen, die von Autos befahren werden. Im Datensatz sind die Straßen zunächst einmal nur als Linie angegeben, es gibt keinen öffentlichen Datensatz, der die genauen Angaben beinhaltet, wie breit eine Straße jeweils genau ist. Deswegen wurde für die Berechnung die minimale Breite angenommen: 2,5 Meter - diese Zahl basiert auf der maximalen Zulassungsbreite für Autos.&lt;br/&gt;Die Mittelpunkte der Kreise stellen jeweils die abgelegensten Punkte eines Straßenblocks dar. Auf Grundlage der Berechnungen können dabei Abweichungen von etwa 5 Metern auftreten.&lt;p&gt;Ein Kartenexperiment von &lt;a class=&quot;uk-button uk-button-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://hanshack.com/&quot;&gt;Hans Hack&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=&quot;uk-button uk-button-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hnshck&quot;&gt;@hnshck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;td readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;With the advent of wix, squarespace, and other code free forms of website developement, it seems as if the demand for custom built sites are at an all time low.
&lt;p&gt;The little demand left is shared among a seemingly never ending hord of aspiring freelance developers, many of whom are willing to work at prices far below that of what their skills had once demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a market such as this what place, if any, is there for new developers who wish to break into freelancing? Is there any hope at all for these developers? Or have the days of freelancing been put to an end by abstraction and oversaturation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
