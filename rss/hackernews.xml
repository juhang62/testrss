&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday ordered two state agencies to investigate a media report that Facebook Inc may be accessing far more personal information from smartphone users, including health and other sensitive data, than had previously been known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directive to New York’s Department of State and Department of Financial Services came after The Wall Street Journal said testing showed that Facebook collected personal information from other apps on users’ smartphones within seconds of them entering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WSJ reported that several apps share sensitive user data including weight, blood pressure and ovulation status with Facebook. The report said that the company can access data in some cases even when the user is not signed into Facebook or does not have a Facebook account. In a statement Cuomo called the practice an “outrageous abuse of privacy.” He also called on the relevant federal regulators to become involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in Facebook took a short-lived hit after the Wall Street Journal report was published, but closed up 1.2 percent. In late January Cuomo along with New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an investigation into Apple Inc’s failure to warn consumers about a FaceTime bug that had let iPhones users listen to conversations of others who have not yet accepted a video call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is facing a slew of lawsuits and regulatory inquiries over privacy issues, including a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation into disclosures that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York’s financial services department does not traditionally supervise social media companies directly, but has waded into digital privacy in the financial sector and could have oversight of some app providers that send user data to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, it is slated to implement the country’s first cybersecurity rules governing state-regulated financial institutions such as banks, insurers and credit monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, DFS said life insurers could use social media posts in underwriting policies, so long as they did not discriminate based on race, colour, national origin, sexual orientation or other protected classes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>RIP Culture War Thread</title>
<link>https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;[This post is having major technical issues. Some comments may not be appearing. If you can’t comment, please say so on the subreddit.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I. I Come To Praise Caesar, Not To Bury Him&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, an SSC reader made an r/slatestarcodex subreddit for discussion of blog posts here and related topics. As per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/&quot;&gt;usual process&lt;/a&gt;, the topics that generated the strongest emotions – Trump, gender, race, the communist menace, the fascist menace, etc – started taking over. The moderators (and I had been added as an honorary mod at the time) decreed that all discussion of these topics should be corralled into one thread so that nobody had to read them unless they really wanted to. This achieved its desired goal: most of the subreddit went back to being about cognitive science and medicine and other less-polarizing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, the restriction to one thread kick-started the culture war discussions rather than toning them down. The thread started getting thousands of comments per week, some from people who had never even heard of this blog and had just wandered in from elsewhere on Reddit. It became its own community, with different norms and different members from the rest of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected this to go badly. It kind of did; no politics discussion area ever goes &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well. There were some of the usual flame wars, point-scoring, and fanatics. I will be honest and admit I rarely read the thread myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in between all of that, there was some really impressive analysis, some good discussion, and even a few changed minds. Some testimonials from participants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.808&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all its awfulness there really is something special about the CW thread. There are conversations that have happened there that cannot be replicated elsewhere. Someone mentioned its accidental brilliance and I think that’s right—it catches a wonderful conversational quality I’ve never seen on the Internet, and I’ve been on the Internet since the 90s – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vjued/meta_the_case_for_moving_the_cw_thread/e9d2oo7/&quot;&gt;werttrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.5862068965517&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that, while practically ever criticism of the CW thread I have ever read is true, it is still the best and most civil culture war-related forum for conversation I have seen. And I find the best-of roundup an absolute must-read every week – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vjued/meta_the_case_for_moving_the_cw_thread/e9d9z64/&quot;&gt;yrrosimyarin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14.84496124031&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Culture War Roundup threads were blessedly neutral ground for people to test their premises and moral intuitions against a gauntlet of (sometimes-forced!) kindness and charity. There was no guarantee that your opinion would carry the day, but if you put in the effort, you could be assured a fair reading and cracking debate. Very little was solved, but I’m not sure that was really the point. The CWRs were a place to broaden your understanding of a given topic by an iterative process of “Yes, but…” and for a place that boasted more than 15,000 participants, shockingly little drama ensued. That was the /r/slatestarcodex CWRs at their best, and that’s the way we hope they will be remembered by the majority of people who participated in them. – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/ape14r/obituary_for_the_culture_war_roundups_on/&quot;&gt;rwkasten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12.417366946779&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really need to turn these QCs into a book or wiki or library of some kind. So much good thought, observation, introspection, etc. exists in just this one thread alone–to say nothing of the other QC posts in past CW threads. It would be nice to have a separate place, organized by subject matter, to just read these insightful posts – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ai7l6a/quality_contributions_catch_up_thread/een6wzv/&quot;&gt;TheEgosLastStand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12.809104258443&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the CW thread is obviously a huge lump of positive utility for a large number of people, because otherwise they wouldn’t spend so much time on it. I’ve learned a lot in the thread, both about the ideas and beliefs of my outgroups, and by better honing my own beliefs and ideas in a high-pressure selective environment. I’ve shared out the results of what I’ve learned to all of my ingroup across Facebook and Twitter and in person, and I honestly think it’s helped foster better and more sophisticated thought about the culture war in a clique of several dozen SJ-aligned young people in the OC area, just from my tangential involvement as a vector – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vjued/meta_the_case_for_moving_the_cw_thread/e9dtpwb/&quot;&gt;darwin2500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15.742857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, as other commenters in this thread have said, I recognize it does have a lot of full-time opinionated idiots squabbling, and is inarguably filled with irrationality, bad takes, contrarianism, and Boo Outgroup posturing. I agree with many of [the criticisms] of overtly racist and stupid posts in there. Yet it also has a special, weird, fascinating quality which has led to some very insightful discussions which I have not encountered anywhere else on the Internet (and I have used the Internet 8+ hours a day almost my whole life). – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vjued/meta_the_case_for_moving_the_cw_thread/e9d6n8b/&quot;&gt;c_o_r_b_a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.8263665594855&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no place on the internet that can have discussions about culture war topics with even an approximation of the quality of this place. Shutting this thread down [would] not mean moving the discussion elsewhere, for a lot of people it means removing the ability to discuss these things entirely – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vjued/meta_the_case_for_moving_the_cw_thread/e9d74qf/&quot;&gt;Zornau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.6644295302013&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that the CW thread, for all its flaws, occupies a certain niche that can’t easily be replicated elsewhere. I also feel that its flaws need to compared not to a Platonic ideal but to typical online political discourse, which often ends up as pure echo chambers or flame wars. – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vjued/meta_the_case_for_moving_the_cw_thread/e9duyo9/&quot;&gt;honeypuppy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.575&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the only political forums I can read online without reaching for the nearest sharp stick to poke my eyes out. It has a sort of free-flowing conversational feel that’s really appealing. There are some thoughtful people and discussions there that I hope can continue and be preserved. – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vjued/meta_the_case_for_moving_the_cw_thread/e9dzla8/&quot;&gt;TracingWoodgrains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a great founding population, some very hard-working moderators, and a unique rule-set that emphasized trying to understand and convince rather than yell and shame, the Culture War thread became something special. People from all sorts of political positions, from the most boring centrists to the craziest extremists, had some weirdly good discussions and came up with some really deep insights into what the heck is going on in some of society’s most explosive controversies.

I also benefitted from its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/a923ge/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_24/ecujj5q/&quot;&gt;weekly roundup of interesting social science studies&lt;/a&gt; and arch-moderator baj2235’s semi-regular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ai7l6a/quality_contributions_catch_up_thread/&quot;&gt;Quality Contributions Catch-Up Thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Culture War Thread aimed to be a place where people with all sorts of different views could come together to talk to and learn from one another. I think this &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; succeeded. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/13/ssc-survey-results-2019/&quot;&gt;the last SSC survey&lt;/a&gt;, I asked who participated in the thread, and used that to get a pretty good idea of its userbase. Here are some statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/ripculture1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superficially, this is remarkably well-balanced. 51% of Culture War Thread participants identified as left-of-center on the survey, compared to 49% of people who identified as right-of-center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was less parity in party identification, with a bit under two Democrats to every Republican. But this, too, reflects the national picture. The latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; poll found that 34% of Americans identified as Democrat, compared to only 25% Republican. Since presidential elections are usually very close, it looks like left-of-center people are more willing to openly identify with the Democratic Party than right-of-center people are with the Republicans; the CW demographics show a similar picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looked at in more detail, this correspondence with the general population is not quite as perfect as it seems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/ripculture2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pie chart on the left shows people broken down by a finer-grained measure of political affiliation. We see very few people identified as straight-out conservatives. Right-of-center people were more likely to be either libertarians or neoreactionaries (a technocratic, anti-democracy movement that the survey instructed people to endorse if they wanted to be more like “for example Singapore: prosperity, technology, and stability more important than democratic process”). Although straight-out “liberal” had a better showing than “conservative”, the ranks of the Left still ended up divided among left-libertarians and social democrats (which the survey instructed people to endorse if they wanted to be more like “for example Scandinavian countries: heavily-regulated market economy, cradle-to-grave social safety net, socially permissive multiculturalism”). Overall, the CW thread is a little more to the fringes on the both sides, especially the parts of the fringes popular among its young, mostly nonreligious, kind of libertarian, mostly technophile demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also doesn’t like Trump. Although he has a 40% approval rating among the general population, only about 14% of CWers were even somewhat favorable toward him. RCP suggests that anti-Trumpers outnumber pro-Trumpers in the general population by 1.4x; among CW thread participants, that number increases to almost 5x! This fits the story above where most right-of-center participants are libertarians or skeptical of democracy/populism as opposed to standard conservatives. Still, I occasionally saw Trump supporters giving their pitch in the Culture War thread, or being willing to answer questions about why they thought what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last few years of Culture War thread, a consensus grew up that it was heavily right-wing. This isn’t what these data show, and on the few times I looked at it myself, it wasn’t what I saw either. After being challenged to back this up, I analyzed ten randomly chosen comments on the thread; four seemed neutral, three left/liberal, and three conservative. When someone else objected that it was a more specific “blatant” anti-transgender bias, I counted up all the mentions of transgender on three weeks worth of Culture War threads: of five references, two were celebrating how exciting/historic a transgender person recently winning an election was, a third was neutrally referring to the election, a fourth was a trans person talking about their experiences, and a fifth was someone else neutrally mentioning that they were transgender. This sort of thing happened enough times that I stopped being interested in arguing the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge many people’s lived experience that the thread felt right-wing; my working theory is that most of the people I talk to about this kind of thing are Bay Area liberals for whom the thread was their first/only exposure to a space with any substantial right-wing presence at all, which must have made it feel scarily conservative. This may also be a question of who sorted by top, who sorted by new, and who sorted by controversial. In any case, you can just read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/akk8nc/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_january_28/&quot;&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/amyesc/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_february_04/&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; threads and form your own opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever its biases and whatever its flaws, the Culture War thread was a place where very strange people from all parts of the political spectrum were able to engage with each other, treat each other respectfully, and sometimes even change their minds about some things. I am less interested in re-opening the debate about exactly which side of the spectrum the average person was on compared to celebrating the rarity of having a place where people of very different views came together to speak at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II. We Need To Have A National Conversation About Why We Can No Longer Have A National Conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is called “RIP Culture War Thread”, so you may have already guessed things went south. What happened? The short version is: a bunch of people harassed and threatened me for my role in hosting it, I had a nervous breakdown, and I asked the moderators to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll get to the long version eventually, but first I want to stress that this isn’t just my story. It’s the story of everyone who’s tried to host a space for political discussion on the Internet. Take the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, in particular their article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/reader-center/comments-moderation.html&quot;&gt;Why No Comments? It’s A Matter Of Resources&lt;/a&gt;. Translated from corporate-speak, it basically says that unmoderated comment sections had too many “trolls”, so they decided to switch to moderated comment sections only, but they don’t have enough resources to moderate any controversial articles, so commenting on controversial articles is banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. In the past five years, CNN, NPR, The Atlantic, Vice, Bloomberg, Motherboard, and almost every other major news source has closed their comments – usually accompanied by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150917/09222332282/trend-killing-news-comment-sections-because-you-just-really-value-conversation-stupidly-continues.shtml&quot;&gt;weird corporate-speak&lt;/a&gt; about how “because we really value conversations, we are closing our comment section forever effective immediately”. People have written articles like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/letters/archive/2018/02/letters-comments-on-the-end-of-comments/552392/&quot;&gt;The Comments Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2015/10/brief-history-of-the-demise-of-the-comments-timeline/&quot;&gt;A Brief History Of The End Of The Comments&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2015/11/10/is-the-era-of-reader-comments-on-news-websites-fading/#33a2b7884379&quot;&gt;Is The Era Of Reader Comments On News Websites Fading?&lt;/a&gt; This raises a lot of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like: I was able to find half a dozen great people to do a great job moderating the Culture War Thread 100% for free without even trying. How come some of the richest and most important news sources in the world can’t find or afford a moderator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or: can’t they just hide the comments behind a content warning saying “These comments are unmoderated, read at your own risk, click to expand”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This confused me until I had my own experience with the Culture War thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, it’s very easy to moderate comment sections. It’s very easy to remove spam, bots, racial slurs, low-effort trolls, and abuse. I do it single-handedly on this blog’s 2000+ weekly comments. r/slatestarcodex’s volunteer team of six moderators did it every day on the CW Thread, and you can scroll through week after week of multiple-thousand-post culture war thread and see how thorough a job they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you remove all those things, you’re left with people honestly and civilly arguing for their opinions. And that’s the scariest thing of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think society should tolerate pedophilia, are obsessed with this, and can rattle off a laundry list of studies that they say justify their opinion. Some people think police officers are enforcers of oppression and this makes them valid targets for violence. Some people think immigrants are destroying the cultural cohesion necessary for a free and prosperous country. Some people think transwomen are a tool of the patriarchy trying to appropriate female spaces. Some people think Charles Murray and &lt;em&gt;The Bell Curve&lt;/em&gt; were right about everything. Some people think Islam represents an existential threat to the West. Some people think women are biologically less likely to be good at or interested in technology. Some people think men are biologically more violent and dangerous to children. Some people just really worry a lot about the Freemasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these views has adherents who are, no offense, smarter than you are. Each of these views has, at times, won over entire cultures so completely that disagreeing with them then was as unthinkable as agreeing with them is today. I disagree with most of them but don’t want to be too harsh on any of them. Reasoning correctly about these things is excruciatingly hard, trusting consensus opinion would have led you horrifyingly wrong throughout most of the past, and other options, if they exist, are obscure and full of pitfalls. I tend to go with philosophers from Voltaire to Mill to Popper who say the only solution is to let everybody have their say and then try to figure it out in the marketplace of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of those luminaries had to deal with online comment sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about an online comment section is that the guy who really likes pedophilia is going to start posting on every thread about sexual minorities “I’m glad those sexual minorities have their rights! Now it’s time to start arguing for pedophile rights!” followed by a ten thousand word manifesto. This person won’t use any racial slurs, won’t be a bot, and can probably reach the same standards of politeness and reasonable-soundingness as anyone else. Any fair moderation policy won’t provide the moderator with any excuse to delete him. But it will be very embarrassing for to &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; to have anybody who visits their website see pro-pedophilia manifestos a bunch of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So they should deal with it! That’s the bargain they made when deciding to host the national conversation!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, you don’t understand. It’s not just the predictable and natural reputational consequences of having some embarrassing material in a branded space. It’s &lt;em&gt;enemy action&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Twitter influencer who wants to profit off of outrage culture is going to be posting 24-7 about how the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; endorses pedophilia. Breitbart or some other group that doesn’t like the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; for some reason will publish article after article on &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;‘ secret pro-pedophile agenda. Allowing any aspect of your brand to come anywhere near something unpopular and taboo is like a giant Christmas present for people who hate you, people who hate everybody and will take whatever targets of opportunity present themselves, and a thousand self-appointed moral crusaders and protectors of the public virtue. It doesn’t matter if taboo material makes up 1% of your comment section; it will inevitably make up 100% of &lt;em&gt;what people hear about your comment section&lt;/em&gt; and then of &lt;em&gt;what people think is in your comment section&lt;/em&gt;. Finally, it will make up 100% of what people associate with you and your brand. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/16/cardiologists-and-chinese-robbers/&quot;&gt;Chinese Robber Fallacy&lt;/a&gt; is a harsh master; all you need is a tiny number of cringeworthy comments, and your political enemies, power-hungry opportunists, and 4channers just in it for the lulz can convince everyone that your entire brand is about being pro-pedophile, catering to the pedophilia demographic, and providing a platform for pedophile supporters. And if you ban the pedophiles, they’ll do the same thing for the next-most-offensive opinion in your comments, and then the next-most-offensive, until you’ve censored everything except “Our benevolent leadership really is doing a great job today, aren’t they?” and the comment section becomes a mockery of its original goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me tell you about my experience hosting the Culture War thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(“hosting” isn’t entirely accurate. The Culture War thread was hosted on the r/slatestarcodex subreddit, which I did not create and do not own. I am an honorary moderator of that subreddit, but aside from the very occasional quick action against spam nobody else caught, I do not actively play a part in its moderation. Still, people correctly determined that I was probably the weakest link, and chose me as the target.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People settled on a narrative. The Culture War thread was made up entirely of homophobic transphobic alt-right neo-Nazis. I freely admit there were people who were against homosexuality in the thread (according to my survey, 13%), people who opposed using trans people’s preferred pronouns (according to my survey, 9%), people who identified as alt-right (7%), and a single person who identified as a neo-Nazi (who as far as I know never posted about it). Less outrageous ideas were proportionally more popular: people who were mostly feminists but thought there were differences between male and female brains, people who supported the fight against racial discrimination but thought could be genetic differences between races. All these people definitely existed, some of them in droves. All of them had the right to speak; sometimes I sympathized with some of their points. If this had been the complaint, I would have admitted to it right away. If the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; can’t avoid attracting these people to its comment section, no way r/ssc is going to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead it was always that the the thread was “dominated by” or “only had” or “was an echo chamber for” homophobic transphobic alt-right neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that the subreddit was dominated by homophobic etc neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that the SSC community was dominated by homophobic etc neo-Nazis, which always grew into the claim that I personally was a homophobic etc neo-Nazi of them all. I am a pro-gay Jew who has dated trans people and votes pretty much straight Democrat. I lost distant family in the Holocaust. You can imagine how much fun this was for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People would message me on Twitter to shame me for my Nazism. People who linked my blog on social media would get replies from people “educating” them that they were supporting Nazism, or asking them to justify why they thought it was appropriate to share Nazi sites. I wrote a silly blog post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/15/kernel-of-doubt-testing-math-preference-vs-corn-eating-style/&quot;&gt;mathematics and corn-eating&lt;/a&gt;. It reached the front page of a math subreddit and got a lot of upvotes. Somebody found it, asked if people knew that the blog post about corn was from a pro-alt-right neo-Nazi site that tolerated racists and sexists. There was a big argument in the comments about whether it should ever be acceptable to link to or read my website. Any further conversation about math and corn was abandoned. This kept happening, to the point where I wouldn’t even read Reddit discussions of my work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people started an article about me on a left-wing wiki that listed the most offensive things I have ever said, and the most offensive things that have ever been said by anyone on the SSC subreddit and CW thread over its three years of activity, all presented in the most damning context possible; it started steadily rising in the Google search results for my name. A subreddit devoted to insulting and mocking me personally and Culture War thread participants in general got started; it now has over 2,000 readers. People started threatening to use my bad reputation to discredit the communities I was in and the causes I cared about most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people found my real name and started posting it on Twitter. Some people made entire accounts devoted to doxxing me in Twitter discussions whenever an opportunity came up. A few people just messaged me letting me know they knew my real name and reminding me that they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do this if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people started messaging my real-life friends, telling them to stop being friends with me because I supported racists and sexists and Nazis. Somebody posted a monetary reward for information that could be used to discredit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person called the clinic where I worked, pretended to be a patient, and tried to get me fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(not all of this was because of the Culture War thread. Some of this was because of my own bad opinions and my own bad judgment. But the Culture War thread kept coming up. As I became more careful in my own writings, the Culture War thread loomed larger and larger in the threats and complaints. And when the Culture War thread got closed down, the subreddit about insulting me had a “declaring victory” post, which I interpret as confirmation that this was one of the main things going on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to claim martyrdom. None of these things actually hurt me in real life. My blog continues to be popular, my friends stuck by me, and my clinic didn’t let me go. I am not going to be able to set up a classy new FiredForTruth.com website like James Damore did. What actually happened was much more prosaic: I had a nervous breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t even that bad a nervous breakdown. I was able to keep working through it. I just sort of broke off all human contact for a couple of weeks and stayed in my room freaking out instead. This is similar enough to my usual behavior that nobody noticed, which suited me fine. And I learned a lot (for example, did you know that sceletium has a combination of SSRI-like compounds and PDE2 inhibitors that make it really good at treating nervous breakdowns? True!). And it wasn’t like the attacks were objectively intolerable or that everybody would have had a nervous breakdown in my shoes: I’m a naturally obsessive person, I take criticism especially badly, and I had some other things going on too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, friends of mine who were smarter and more careful than I was started suggesting that it would be better for me, and for them as people who had to deal with the social consequences of being my friend, if I were to shut down the thread. And at the same time, I got some more reasons to think that this blog could contribute to really important things – AI, effective charity, meta-science – in ways that would be harder to do from the center of a harassment campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So around October, I talked to some subreddit mods and asked them what they thought about spinning off the Culture Wars thread to its own forum, one not affiliated with the Slate Star Codex brand or the r/slatestarcodex subreddit. The first few I approached were positive; some had similar experiences to mine; one admitted that even though he personally was not involved with the CW thread and only dealt with other parts of the subreddit, he taught at a college and felt like his job would not be safe so long as the subreddit and CW thread were affiliated. Apparently the problem was bigger than just me, and other people had been dealing with it in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other moderators, the ones most closely associated with the CW thread itself, were strongly opposed. They emphasized some of the same things I emphasized above: that the thread was a really unique place for great conversation about all sorts of important topics, that the majority of commenters and posts were totally inoffensive, and that one shouldn’t give in to terrorists. I respect all these points, but I respected them less from the middle of a nervous breakdown, and eventually the vote among the top nine mods and other stakeholders was 5-4 in favor of getting rid of it. It took three months to iron out all the details, but a few weeks ago everyone finally figured things out and the CW thread closed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point this stops being my story. A group of pro-CW-thread mods led by ZorbaTHut, cjet79, and baj2235 set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/&quot;&gt;r/TheMotte&lt;/a&gt;, a new subreddit for continuing the Culture War Thread tradition. After a week, the top post already has 4,243 comments, so it looks like the move went pretty well. Despite fears – which I partly shared – that the transition would not be good for the Thread, early signs suggest it has survived intact. I’m hopeful this can be a win-win situation, freeing me from a pretty serious burden while the Thread itself expands and flourishes under the leadership of a more anonymous group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III. The Thread Is Dead, Long Live The Thread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I debated for a long time whether or not to write this post. The arguments against are obvious: never let the trolls know they’re getting to you. Once they know they’re getting to you, that you’re susceptible to pressure, obviously they redouble their efforts. I stuck to this for a long time. I’m still sort of sticking to it, in that I’m avoiding specifics and &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; avoiding links (which I realize has made my story harder to prove true, sorry). I’ll try to resume the policy fully after this, but I thought one post on the subject was worth the extra misery for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a lot of people were (rightfully! understandably!) very angry about the loss of the Culture War thread from r/ssc, and told the moderators that, as the kids say these days, “a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation”. I promised to do this, so now I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I wanted there to be at least one of these “here’s why we’re removing your ability to comment” articles that was honest, not made of corporate-speak, and less patronizing than “we’re removing the comment section because we value your speech so much and want to promote great conversations”. Hopefully this will be the skeleton key that helps you understand what all those other articles would have said if they weren’t run through fifty layers of PR teams. I would like to give people another perspective on events like Tumblr banning female-presenting nipples or Patreon dropping right-wing YouTubers or Twitter constantly introducing new algorithms that misfire and ban random groups of people. These companies aren’t inherently censorious. They’re just afraid. Everyone is afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I would like to offer one final, admittedly from-a-position-of-weakness, f**k you at everyone who contributed to this. I think you’re bad people, and you make me really sad. Not in a joking performative Internet sadness way. In an actual, I-think-you-made-my-life-and-the-world-worse way. I realize I’m mostly talking to the sort of people who delight in others’ distress and so this won’t register. But I’m also a little upset at some of my (otherwise generally excellent) friends in the rationalist community who were quick to jump on the “Oh, yeah, the SSC subreddit is full of gross people and I wish they couldn’t speak” bandwagon (to be clear, I don’t mean the friends who offered me good advice about separating from the CW thread for the sake of my own well-being, I mean people who actively contributed to worsening the whole community’s reputation based on a few bad actors). I understand you were probably honest in your opinion, but I think there was a lot of room to have thought through those opinions more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, I want anybody else trying to host “the national conversation” to have a clear idea of the risks. If you plan to be anything less than maximally censorious, consider keeping your identity anonymous, and think about potential weak links in your chain (ie hosts, advertisers, payment processors, etc). I’m not saying you necessarily need to go full darknet arms merchant. Just keep in mind that lots of people will try to stop you, and they’ve had a really high success rate so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, if someone speaks up against the increasing climate of fear and harassment or the decline of free speech, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/23/can-things-be-both-popular-and-silenced/&quot;&gt;get hit with&lt;/a&gt; an omnidirectional salvo of “You continue to speak just fine, and people are listening to you, so obviously the climate of fear can’t be too bad, people can’t be harassing you too much, and you’re probably just lying to get attention.” But if someone &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; too afraid to speak up, or nobody listens to them, then the issue never gets brought up, and mission accomplished for the people creating the climate of fear. The only way to escape the double-bind is for someone to speak up and admit “Hey, I personally am a giant coward who is silencing himself out of fear in this specific way right now, but only after this message”. This is not a particularly noble role, but it’s one I’m well-positioned to play here, and I think it’s worth the awkwardness to provide at least one example that doesn’t fit the double-bind pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth, I want to apologize to anybody who’s had to deal with me the past – oh, let’s say several years. One of the really bad parts of this debacle has been that it’s made me a much worse person. When I started writing this blog, I think I was a pretty nice person who was willing to listen to and try to hammer out my differences with anyone. As a result of some of what I’ve described, I think I’ve become afraid, bitter, paranoid, and quick to assume that anyone who disagrees with me (along a dimension that too closely resembles some of the really bad people I’ve had to deal with) is a bad actor who needs to be discredited and destroyed. I don’t know how to fix this. I can only apologize for it, admit you’re not imagining it, and ask people to do as I say (especially as I said a few years ago when I was a better person) and not as I do. I do think this is a great learning experience in terms of psychology and will write a post on it eventually; I just wish I didn’t have to learn it from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventh, I want to reassure people who would otherwise treat this story as an unmitigated disaster that there are some bright spots, like that I didn’t suffer any objective damage despite a lot of people trying really hard, and that the Culture War thread lives on bigger and brighter than ever before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighth, as a final middle-finger at the people who killed the Culture War thread, I’d like to advertise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r/TheMotte&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its new home, in the hopes that this whole debacle &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect&quot;&gt;Streisand-Effects&lt;/a&gt; it to the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to stress that I will continue to leave the SSC comment section open as long as is compatible with the political climate and my own health; I ask tolerance if there are otherwise-unfair actions I have to take to make this possible. I also want to stress that I’m not going to stop writing about controversial topics completely – but I do want to have some control over when and where I have to deal with this, and want the privilege of being hung for my own opinions rather than for those of other people I am tangentially associated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not send me expressions of sympathy or try to cast me as a martyr; the first make me feel worse for reasons that are hard to explain; the second wouldn’t really fit the facts and isn’t the look I want to present. Thanks to everyone who helped make the CW thread and this blog what it was/is, and good luck to Zorba and the rest of the Motte moderation team.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Launch HN: Modern Labor (YC W19) – Paying People to Learn to Code</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19227441</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19227441</guid>
<description>Hi HN,
&lt;p&gt;We are Modern Labor (&lt;a href=&quot;https://modernlabor.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://modernlabor.com&lt;/a&gt;). We pay you to learn to code. We take people with little or no software skills and pay them a livable wage[1] for 5 months while they learn to code, using our content, most of which is open source. In return graduates pay us 15% of their income for 2 years if they are earning over $40,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is born out of a phenomenon I’ve been fascinated with for a long time: many people wake up every day at 7am to work at a low-paying job but they often have difficulty completing a class that might help their future. For some people, it might just come down to money. A job pays now, a class pays off in the future and only maybe. For many reasons--time, energy, motivation, financial pressures--many choose or are forced to choose the job that pays now and their long-term income sometimes suffers as a result. So we had an idea: Why don’t we just pay people to learn? So that’s what we do: we pay people, now, to learn an in-demand skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember back when we were building Leif, a startup we sold last year. I told Dickie, one of our co-founders, if I only had an extra $10,000 I could build out the product to an acceptable quality for a couple months. Otherwise I had to work. He ended up giving the money. We sold the company the next year for a good outcome. That couple months of being able to focus made a big difference in the quality of the product and I think ultimately on how successful we were with customers. We think Modern Labor can give people enough time to make a real change in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our program isn’t for everyone. It’s full time. We pay $2000 for 5 months. Sometimes that’s more than enough to live on, sometimes it’s not, especially in the Bay Area. Nearly impossible with a family. You need the right to work in the US. The program is mostly self-directed and online. We guide students with a learning pathway and code reviews, but it’s ultimately up to them. If they don’t do their lessons, we don’t pay. It’s far too short for some people. Right now the curriculum is JavaScript (React, Redux) and Python and focuses on the web, which is only one sliver of the software universe. Most of the content is open source. Some of it’s from places like Freecodecamp, which is available for free. If you have money, you don’t need us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15% of gross income is a lot. Why so much? It comes down to simple risk/return: returns must be adequate given the risk. If it sounds a lot like Lambda School (YC S17), you’re right. Our former company Leif arranged financing for them. We discovered Austen (CEO) here on HN. It’s a big space, though, and our program is different from theirs. We have fewer mentors and our focus is on giving money to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people will do our program? About 50,000 people pay to attend coding bootcamps in the US each year. We believe, and may be wrong, that a lot more people will choose learning when we pay them to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you HN -- HN was the first thing people told me to read when I was learning to code and it’s been a big part of my life ever since. Happy to answer any questions and looking forward to hearing your ideas and feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Right now it’s $2000/month&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An update about Redis developments in 2019</title>

&lt;pre&gt;
Yesterday a concerned Redis user wrote the following on Hacker News:

— &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19204436&quot;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19204436&lt;/a&gt; —
I love Redis, but I'm a bit skeptical of some of the changes that are currently in development. The respv3 protocol has some features that, while they sound neat, also could significantly complicate client library code. There's also a lot of work going into a granular acl. I can't imagine why this would be necessary, or a higher priority than other changes like multi-thread support, better persistence model, data-types, etc.
— end of user comment —

I’ve the feeling she/he (not sure) is not the only one that looks at ACLs as some sort of feature imposed by the Redis Labs goals, because “enterprise users” or something like that. Also the other points in the comment are interesting, and I believe everything is very well worth addressing in order to communicate clearly with the Redis community what’s the road ahead.

For simplicity I’ll split this blog post into sections addressing every single feature mentioned in the original comment.

## RESP3

The goal of RESP3, as I already blogged in these pages, is to actually simplify the clients landscape. Hopefully every client will have a lower layer that will not try to reinvent some kind of higher level interface: redis.call(“get”,”foo”). There is no longer need to orchestrate conversions because now the protocol is semantical enough to tell the client what a given reply should look like in the hand of the caller, nor any need to know beforehand the command fingerprint for the majority of commands. What I think the user is referring is RESP3 support for out of band communications, that is the reply “attributes”.

I really believe that in the future of Redis “client side caching” will be a big thing. It’s the logical step in every scalable system. However without server assistance client side cache invalidation is a nightmare. This is the reason why RESP3 supports attributes in replies, mainly. However probably Redis 6 *will not implement any of that*. Redis unstable, that will become Redis 6, already has a RESP3 implementation that is almost complete, and there are no attributes. The clients implementing RESP3 can just decide to discard attributes if they are willing to be really future-proof, and likely attributes will not be sent at all anyway even for future Redis versions if the user did not activate some kind of special feature. For instance, for client side caching, the connection will have to be put in some special mode. Moreover, as you know, Redis 6 will be completely backward compatible with RESP2. Actually I’m starting to believe that RESP2 support will never be removed, because it is almost for free, and there is no good reason to break backward compatibility once we did the effort to implement the abstraction layer between RESP2 and RESP3.

Normally I don’t like to change things without a good reason, however RESP2 limitations were having a strong effect on the client ecosystem. I would like to have a client landscape where users, going from one client to the other, will feel at home, and the API will be the Redis API, not the layer that the client author invented. I’m not against an *higher level* API in addition to the lower level one btw, but there should be a common ground, and clients should be able to send commands without knowing anything about such commands.

## ACLs

The ACL specification was redacted by myself four years ago. I waited so much time in order to convince myself this was really the time to implement it: we went a long way without any ACL using just tricks, mainly command renaming. However don’t believe that ACLs main motivation is enterprise customers in need for security. As a side effect, ACLs also allow authentication of users for security purposes, but the main goal of the feature is *operational*.

Let me show you an example. You have a Redis instance and you plan to use the instance to do a new thing: delayed jobs processing. You get a library from the internet, and it looks to work well. Now why on the earth such library, that you don’t know line by line, should be able to call “FLUSHALL” and flush away your database instantly? Maybe the library test will have such command inside and you realize it when it’s too late. Or maybe you just hired a junior developer that is keeping calling “KEYS *” on the Redis instance, while your company Redis policy is “No KEYS command”.

Another scenario, cloud providers: they need to carefully rename the admin commands, and even to mask such commands from being leaked for some reason. More tricks: so MONITOR will not show the commands in the output for instance. With ACLs you can setup Redis so that default users, without some authentication, will be prevented to run anything that is administrative or dangerous. I think this will be a big improvement for operations.

Moreover ACLs is one of the best code I wrote for Redis AFAIK. There is nearly no CPU cost at all, unless you se key patterns, but even so it’s small. The implementation is completely self contained inside the acl.c file, the rest of the core has a handful of calls to the ACL API. No complexity added to the system because it is completely modular. Actually the ACL code allowed to do some good refactoring around the AUTH command.

## Multi threading

There are two possible multi threading supports that Redis could get. I believe the user is referring to “memcached alike” multithreading, that is the ability to scale a single Redis instance to multiple threads in order to increase the operations per second it can deliver in things like GET or SET and other simple commands. This involves making the I/O, command parsing and so forth multi threaded. So let’s call this thing “I/O threading”.

Another multi threaded approach is to, instead, allow slow commands to be executed in a different thread, so that other clients are not blocked. We’ll call this threading model “Slow commands threading”.

Well, that’s the plan: I/O threading is not going to happen in Redis AFAIK, because after much consideration I think it’s a lot of complexity without a good reason. Many Redis setups are network or memory bound actually. Additionally I really believe in a share-nothing setup, so the way I want to scale Redis is by improving the support for multiple Redis instances to be executed in the same host, especially via Redis Cluster. The things that will happen in 2019 about that are two:

A) Redis Cluster multiple instances will be able to orchestrate to make a judicious use of the disk of the local instance, that is, let’s avoid an AOF rewrite at the same time.

B) We are going to ship a Redis Cluster proxy as part of the Redis project, so that users are able to abstract away a cluster without having a good implementation of the Cluster protocol client side.

Another thing to note is that Redis is not Memcached, but, like memcached, is an in-memory system. To make multithreaded an in-memory system like memcached, with a very simple data model, makes a lot of sense. A multi-threaded on-disk store is mandatory. A multi-threaded complex in-memory system is in the middle where things become ugly: Redis clients are not isolated, and data structures are complex. A thread doing LPUSH need to serve other threads doing LPOP. There is less to gain, and a lot of complexity to add.

What instead I *really want* a lot is slow operations threading, and with the Redis modules system we already are in the right direction. However in the future (not sure if in Redis 6 or 7) we’ll get key-level locking in the module system so that threads can completely acquire control of a key to process slow operations. Now modules can implement commands and can create a reply for the client in a completely separated way, but still to access the shared data set a global lock is needed: this will go away.

## Better persistence

Recently we did multiple efforts in order to improve this kind of fundamental functions of Redis. One of the best thing that was implemented lately is the RDB preamble inside the AOF file. Also a lot of work went both in Redis 4 and 5 about replication, that is now completely at another level compared to what it used to be. And yes, it is still one of my main focus to improve such parts.

## Data structures

Now Redis has Streams, starting with Redis 5. For Redis 6 and 7 what is planned is, to start, to make what we have much more memory efficient by changing the implementations of certain things. However to add new data structures there are a lot of considerations to do. It took me years to realize how to fill the gap, with streams, between lists, pub/sub and sorted sets, in the context of time series and streaming. I really want Redis to be a set of orthogonal data structures that the user can put together, and not a set of *tools* that are ready to use. Streams are an abstract log, so I think it’s a very worthwhile addition. However other things I’m not completely sure if they are worth to be inside the core without a very long consideration. Anyway in the latest years there was definitely more stress in adding new data structures. HyperLogLogs, more advanced bit operations, streams, blocking sorted set operations (ZPOP* and BZPOP*), and streams are good examples.

## Conclusions

I believe that the Redis community should be aware about why something is done and why something is instead postponed. I do the error to communicate a lot via Twitter like if everybody is there, but many people happen to have a life :-D and don’t care. The blog is a much better way to inform the community, I need to take the time to blog more. Incidentally I love to write posts, so it’s a win-win. An important thing to realize is that Redis has not a solid roadmap, over the years I found that opportunistic development is a huge win over having a roadmap. Something is demanded? I see the need? I’m in the mood to code it? It’s the right moment because there are no other huge priorities? There are a set of users that are helping the design process, giving hints, ideas, testing stuff? It’s the right moment, let’s do it. To have a solid roadmap for Redis is silly because the size of the OSS core team is small, sometimes I remain stuck with some random crash for weeks… Any fixed long term plan would not work. Moreover as the Redis community gives feedbacks my ideas change a lot, so I would rewrite the roadmap every month. Yet blogging is a good solution to at least show what is the current version of the priorities / ideas, and to show why other ideas were abandoned.

A final note: the level of freedom I've with Redis Labs about what to put inside the open source project side is almost infinite. I think this is kinda of a miracle in the industry, or just the people I work with at Redis Labs are nice folks that understand that what we are doing originated from the open source movement and is wise to keep it going in that way. But it's not a common thing. If I do errors in the Redis roadmap they are surely my errors.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

<title>Apple to Close Stores in Eastern District of Texas to Fight Patent Trolls</title>
<link>https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/22/apple-closing-stores-in-eastern-district-texas/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/22/apple-closing-stores-in-eastern-district-texas/</guid>
<description>Apple plans to close both of its retail stores within the Eastern District of Texas in a few months from now in an effort to protect itself from patent trolls, according to five sources familiar with the matter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/02/apple-store-inside-800x437.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;437&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-681645&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/retail/willowbend/&quot;&gt;Apple Willow Bend&lt;/a&gt; in Plano, Texas and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/retail/stonebriar/&quot;&gt;Apple Stonebriar&lt;/a&gt; in Frisco, Texas, both located in the northern suburbs of Dallas, are expected to permanently close in mid April. One source said each store's final day of business will be Friday, April 12. Employees were briefed about the plans earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To continue to serve the region, Apple plans to open a new store at the Galleria Dallas shopping mall in Dallas, just outside the Eastern District of Texas border. One source said the store will open Saturday, April 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/02/apple-eastern-texas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;747&quot; height=&quot;690&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-681644&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rough visualization of Apple's retail stores in the Eastern District of Texas and its upcoming Galleria Dallas store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plans are significant, as U.S. law states that patent infringement lawsuits may be filed &quot;where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.&quot; By closing its stores in Eastern Texas, Apple is ending its established place of business in the district.&lt;p&gt;Residency is also a factor in determining the applicable venue of a patent infringement lawsuit, but in May 2017, the Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krcl.com/articles/patently-unpredictable-patent-venue-laws-after-tc-heartland-in-re-cray/&quot;&gt;shifted precedent&lt;/a&gt; by ruling that a U.S. corporation resides only in its state of incorporation. Apple is incorporated in California, not Texas, satisfying this clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eastern District of Texas has been a hotbed for patent litigation over the past few decades due to well-established rules for patent infringement cases, experienced judges, lower probability of cases being transferred to another district, and quicker jury verdicts, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1146&amp;amp;context=scitech&quot;&gt;SMU Dedman School of Law paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patent infringement lawsuits against Apple will likely shift to U.S. district courts in Northern California and Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we're hearing that the plans, while inconvenient, are not too detrimental for employees. One source said Apple has offered employees opportunities to transfer to other stores, work from home for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/applecare/&quot;&gt;AppleCare&lt;/a&gt;, or severance to those who are not interested in working at another Apple location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has yet to publicly announce the plans. We reached out to Apple for comment late Thursday but have yet to hear back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Apple has confirmed the impending store closures in a statement issued to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/22/apple-confirms-its-plans-to-close-retail-stores-in-the-patent-troll-favored-eastern-district-of-texas/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're making a major investment in our stores in Texas, including significant upgrades to NorthPark Center, Southlake and Knox Street. With a new Dallas store coming to the Dallas Galleria this April, we've made the decision to consolidate stores and close Apple Stonebriar and Apple Willow Bend. All employees from those stores will be offered positions at the new Dallas store or other Apple locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Apple did not provide a specific reason for the store closures beyond consolidation.

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all read those 10x developer articles (I wrote some – guilty as charged!). So if you want to know what you need to work on to improve…well, you have plenty of resources. But I have very seldom come across articles on what NOT to do or how NOT to behave as a developer. And actually, this may be the most important part of the equation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, long overdue, here is what I think is the top list of behaviors you should really work on fast, if you do any of them ;). Why? Well, you might not know it, but your co-workers might hate you for them, as you most likely negatively impact the whole productivity of the team – at the very least!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have one of these developers on your team, it might be worthwhile to share this article in your Slack team channel – just out of general interest, you know 😉!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to prioritize the list from most to least impactful. The goal for me is to start the discussion on the list and prioritize it, too. So please comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Arrogance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the first one, in my mind. You cannot work with a self-absorbed developer. I’ll even go so far as to say:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-click-to-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-ctt-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=As%20long%20as%20you%20are%20willing%20to%20take%20responsibility%20for%20and%20learn%20from%20your%20mistakes%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20a%20bad%20developer.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;As long as you are willing to take responsibility for and learn from your mistakes, you’re not a bad developer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=As%20long%20as%20you%20are%20willing%20to%20take%20responsibility%20for%20and%20learn%20from%20your%20mistakes%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20a%20bad%20developer.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bctt-ctt-btn&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arrogance makes you think that your code is perfect. You may even blame customers for being stupid and for crashing their program rather than reflect on why your software crashed. And that’s how you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1375&quot; src=&quot;https://anaxi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bug-everywhere.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;381&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also messy, unreadable code for your teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with arrogance is that it is a behavior that will prevent you from improving. Stop being arrogant, or you’re just a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may already know the Dunning-Kruger effect. We will mention this effect a few times in the list. Here is a graph explaining it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1375&quot; src=&quot;https://anaxi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dunning-Kruger-Effect.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;559&quot; height=&quot;451&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with arrogance is that 1) the developers don’t understand they are on top of the Peak of “Mt. Stupid,” and 2) they will stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sloppiness in the Work Delivered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways developers can show sloppiness in the code they deliver. We all know at least one developer who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;gives cryptic names for variables, or at best not self-explanatory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;puts typos in function names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leaves old, outdated comments in the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shows a poor selection of data types and data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t bother to run the code formatter, despite being told many times to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignores the IDE warnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copies and pastes StackOverflow code without understanding it or tweaking the solutions to fit their own code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t take the time to document code (nobody wants to read the whole function or file to understand what it does)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t handle errors properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uses excessive dependencies, and updates them without thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t bother to understand the libraries or tools added to the code, potentially leaving glaring issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will always insist on following “best practices” without understanding why those practices are considered “best” (there is no such thing as best practices that adapt to every team)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be such a developer. They annoy the hell out of their colleagues. They slow the whole team’s development process down, requiring their teammates to spend unnecessary time on their code reviews. Their team will dread those code reviews, will grow impatient (we’re still humans), and bugs will get through the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to solve this is for these developers to start to take pride in their work (not to be confused with the arrogance mentioned in point 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Disrespect of Other People’s Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two thing developers hate most are interruptions and unnecessary meetings. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, as meetings are just scheduled interruptions. Developers can’t easily go back to where they were right before an interruption. They need to get into the mindset for development and then slowly trace back to where they left off. And every fellow developer knows that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here are a few ways you can show disrespect to your colleague’s time and productivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;interrupting another developer who is clearly in the zone, for non-important stuff;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;constantly arriving late to meetings, which is a definite choice – whatever anyone says. Either the participants must wait for everyone to be there to start the meeting, or they start without the late developer. In the latter case, he or she will need to be brought up to speed at some point, hence some time lost, and arriving late will disrupt the flow of the meeting in any case;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rambling on and on during meetings. Or, if there are non-coders in the audience, being unwilling to adapt to the audience and wasting time for the entire audience, as any point made will need to be explained again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Constant Negativity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most developers are enthusiastic people, but sometimes you may have the chance (or misfortune) to work with a negative one. Negativity is infectious. If someone complains, it focuses the attention on the negative side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will criticize every choice made: the language, for instance, although, most of the time, those developers are clearly at the top of Mount Stupid (in the Dunning-Kruger Effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t misunderstand me; there should be some criticism in the form of constructive opinions. For example, a Scala developer could talk to a Java developer about promises, saying, “Okay, your language is not as good as mine :P. But you could try CompletableFuture to have a taste of what a monad is. I will show you what you can do with that.” But unfortunately, that kind of friendly attitude is very rare these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Greediness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you have all seen a developer once in a while steal credit for the work produced by a team. This can be done through an email to management, a 1-on-1 talk or another sneaky non-straightforward way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers value competence above all. Taking credit for someone else is taking the other’s competence for yourself and removing it from him or her. This is pretty high up on my list, as I feel it creates a lot of tension and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For greedy developers, such strategies might produce short-term visibility. But in the long run, they will be alienated. Other team members will evolve their communication to highlight their contributions better. After all, there are many ways to give credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Disregard for The Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is done collaboratively with designers, product managers, and other developers. Respecting other people’s input and work is necessary if you don’t want them to go into Hulk mode and flip their desk. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“How” documentation: many programmers comment on every single line of code without describing why it’s doing what it’s doing. If there were a bug in the program and you stumbled across this code, you wouldn’t know where to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing an ugly or not-to-the-specs UI “because they’re not a designer”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not mentioning a UX problem to the product manager, because it’s not part of their job. Ignoring the big picture will make the software hard to use, expensive to maintain, and inconsistent with the other components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not trying to understand how design or product decisions are made. And then continuing to ask the same irrelevant questions – and not improving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not considering other team members’ priority dependencies and leaving them stuck in the mud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a new tool/library without warning any teammates. This can cause unforeseen issues down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Lack of Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering teams solve problems. They use their technical abilities to build features/fix bugs to solve those problems. And some developers just forget about this and will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;philosophize about technical topics instead of focusing on the problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;argue obstinately about technical topics without considering the initial problem (although you do, of course, need to argue when building the solution to the problem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have lengthy discussions about those technical topics yet rely on their own opinions (instead of facts – facts solve problems, not opinions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With code, sure, you can have several solutions to the same problem, but either it works or it doesn’t; there is no in-between. With focus, you can easily alleviate all uncertainties by trying out code in a sandbox, for instance. But lack of focus wastes the time and productivity of everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Lack of Accountability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, either the code works or it doesn’t…but it needs to work in combination with all the code being added to the codebase by your teammates. Software engineering is probably the most collaborative work in today’s world. Any code you write will interact with that of other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for your team to work well, you need accountability. Sure, code reviews don’t let you get away with anything. But accountability is an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unaccountable developers will, for instance, offer excuses instead of solutions. Those excuses may include time constraints or complexity of the tasks. Nobody wants to hear excuses; they want to understand the steps to be taken toward the solution. Excuses don’t invite others to help or provide a good picture of the task’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my list. Feel free to add more if you think of any, or to suggest a different order of importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you have one on the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should know is that this means your manager is not doing their job. The issue should have been identified and the problematic developer(s) coached — if they were deemed coachable. The manager should have given warnings and made the hard decision if the bad developers were still impacting the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-click-to-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-ctt-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=A%20team%20with%20a%20bad%20developer%20is%20way%20better%20off%20short%20one%20developer%20than%20it%20is%20with%20a%20bad%20element.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;A team with a bad developer is way better off short one developer than it is with a bad element.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=A%20team%20with%20a%20bad%20developer%20is%20way%20better%20off%20short%20one%20developer%20than%20it%20is%20with%20a%20bad%20element.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bctt-ctt-btn&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A manager who doesn’t understand this is a manager who doesn’t understand software engineering. You have the case for a bad manager, but that’s for another article ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? I would say this is a question to raise in your one-on-one with your manager, so they can address the issue. If your manager does nothing, you have several options: see if the developer can be coached, and take it upon yourself (and with the cooperation of other teammates), or change teams/companies. Hopefully, this article can help convince the said developer to be a better co-worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ae94&quot; id=&quot;ae94&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;People are resorting to blockchain for all kinds of reasons these days. Ever since I started doing smart contract security audits in mid-2017, I’ve seen it all. A special category of cases is ‘blockchain use’ that seems logical and beneficial, but actually contains a problem that then spreads from one startup to another. I am going to give some examples of such problems and ineffective solutions so that you (developer/customer/investor) know what to do when somebody offers you to use blockchain this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e435&quot; id=&quot;e435&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Disclaimers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;1144&quot; id=&quot;1144&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The described use cases and problems occur at the initial stage. I am not saying these problems are impossible to solve. However, it is important to understand which solutions system creators offer for particular problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;b31a&quot; id=&quot;b31a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Even though the term ‘blockchain use’ looks strange and I am not sure that blockchain can be used for anything other than money (Bitcoin), I am going to use it without quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*CxdGcfL9MeGpf61V.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1240&quot; data-height=&quot;688&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*CxdGcfL9MeGpf61V.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*CxdGcfL9MeGpf61V.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
People are resorting to blockchain for all kinds of reasons these days.
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6f31&quot; id=&quot;6f31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;1. Supply chain management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c9a2&quot; id=&quot;c9a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s say you ordered some goods, and a carrier guarantees to maintain certain transportation conditions, such as keeping your goods cold. A proposed solution is to install a sensor in a truck that will monitor fridge temperature and regularly transmit the data to the blockchain. This way, you can make sure that the promised conditions are met along the entire route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;224b&quot; id=&quot;224b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The problem here is not blockchain, but rather sensor, related. Being part of the physical world, the sensor is easy to fool. For example, a malicious carrier might only cool down a small fridge inside the truck in which they put the sensor, while leaving the goods in the non-refrigerated section of the truck to save costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*yEU4tNk3WVP1EkYr.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1129&quot; data-height=&quot;433&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*yEU4tNk3WVP1EkYr.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*yEU4tNk3WVP1EkYr.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;91fa&quot; id=&quot;91fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I would describe this problem as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8065&quot; id=&quot;8065&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not Internet of Things (IOT).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;987e&quot; id=&quot;987e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We will return to this statement a few more times. Even though blockchain does not allow for modification of data, it cannot ensure such data is correct. The only exception is on-chain transactions, when the system does not need the real world, with all necessary information already being within the blockchain, thus allowing the system to verify data (e.g. that an address has enough funds to proceed with a transaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b8f&quot; id=&quot;3b8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Applications that submit information to a blockchain from the outside are called “oracles” (see article ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.smartdec.net/oracles-or-why-smart-contracts-still-havent-changed-the-world-69464999e1d3&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.smartdec.net/oracles-or-why-smart-contracts-still-havent-changed-the-world-69464999e1d3&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oracles, or Why Smart Contracts Haven’t Changed the World Yet?&lt;/a&gt;’ by Alexander Drygin. Until a solution to the problem with oracles is found, any attempt at blockchain-based supply chain management, like the case above, is as pointless as trying to design a plane without first developing a reliable engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;186b&quot; id=&quot;186b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I borrowed the fridge case from the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘Do you Need Blockchain’ by Karl Wüst and Arthur Gervais&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend reading this article and paying particular attention to the following diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*knXnK63CHrLH8LFQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1120&quot; data-height=&quot;949&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*knXnK63CHrLH8LFQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*knXnK63CHrLH8LFQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6eff&quot; id=&quot;6eff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;2. Object authenticity guarantee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6b3a&quot; id=&quot;6b3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Even though this case is similar to the previous one, I would like to single it out as it is presented in a different wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d28&quot; id=&quot;4d28&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Say we make unique and expensive goods, such as watches, wines, or cars. We want our customers to be absolutely sure they are buying something made by us, so we link our wine bottle to a token supported by blockchain and put a QR code on it. Now, every step of the way (from manufacturer, to carrier, to store, to customer) is confirmed by a separate blockchain transaction and the customer can track their bottle online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5b08&quot; id=&quot;5b08&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, this system is vulnerable to a very simple threat: a dishonest seller can make a copy of a real bottle with a token, fill it with wine of lower quality, and either steal your expensive wine or sell it to someone who does not care about tokens. Why is it so easy? That’s right! Because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4c1&quot; id=&quot;f4c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not IoT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;032e&quot; id=&quot;032e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A bottle is a physical object, and as such can be faked, unlike a digital signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4f7a&quot; id=&quot;4f7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;3. Statement authenticity guarantee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b66f&quot; id=&quot;b66f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s take university diploma authenticity as an example. In this case, we need to verify the genuineness of the statement (“Peter graduated from the university”), rather than a physical object. To make sure the diploma is authentic and the date of issue is accurate, we need to check a digital signature and a time stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cab7&quot; id=&quot;cab7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Digital signatures are great, some even call the asymmetric cryptography they are based on ‘the greatest invention of the 20th century’. But let’s not confuse it with blockchain. Indeed, digital signatures existed and served us well before blockchain was around. Be careful! Today, digital signatures are often sold as blockchain. Perhaps a digital signature is all you really need and blockchain does not really suit your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9ec4&quot; id=&quot;9ec4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Timestamping is closer to blockchain. In fact, blockchain itself is the most reliable timestamping method. You don’t need to invent anything: just put a hash of your data into Bitcoin blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;373f&quot; id=&quot;373f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Is it a good idea to put a hash of student diploma digitally signed by several professors on Bitcoin blockchain? Yes. However, it is important not to screw this system up by using centralized verification through a website or an app, which will be a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0355&quot; id=&quot;0355&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;4. Voting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;051c&quot; id=&quot;051c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;When it comes to using blockchain for voting, we need to be clear about what problem we want to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d44f&quot; id=&quot;d44f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Forgery of vote/voter authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; To tackle this problem, we need digital signature rather than blockchain. The main issue here is a private key: where to get it from and how to store it. I won’t explain why any system in which a key is generated anywhere other than on the end user’s device is broken by design. However, on top of this, it is also important to have open source and properly audited key generating software, third-party hardware (smartphone being the simplest option), and a user who can handle a private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b61f&quot; id=&quot;b61f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While a system developer can address the first two issues, the third is much more difficult. Bitcoin may actually help us learn how to deal with keys. Indeed, losing a password to your social media account or your vote is one thing, but losing a key to your own money is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1889&quot; id=&quot;1889&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet again, it is oracle that links a public key to a particular person if we need it for the voting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*7bVT9k7V2nztSTFf.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;625&quot; data-height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7bVT9k7V2nztSTFf.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e581&quot; id=&quot;e581&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Publicly visible vote counting:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be safe to assume that, say, Ethereum smart contracts are perfect for this issue, as they allow everybody to see how many votes any particular candidate received. However, in this case the level of openness may be too much, as we can see how each and every person votes, and thus can influence them. Although the system may be built in such a way that every vote is only visible to the person who cast it, there is another more complicated challenge: as long as voters are technically able to bring evidence of their voting choice, they could still be put under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f96c&quot; id=&quot;f96c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;UPD:&lt;/strong&gt; Colleagues assure me that there is a solution: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;incoercible encryption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5b16&quot; id=&quot;5b16&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And here, once again, we need oracles to check whether there have been any extra votes from nonexistent voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7f30&quot; id=&quot;7f30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;5. Proof of authorship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da25&quot; id=&quot;da25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s say Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; wants to use blockchain to register that a certain painting is his. He takes a photo of it, puts the photo hash in blockchain, and then uploads the photo to a blog. Now, if Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; claims that the painting belongs to him, Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; can easily prove his authorship by showing the photo and hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84c5&quot; id=&quot;84c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are two potential issues in this case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;5bc3&quot; id=&quot;5bc3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; can say he did not know about blockchain and thus could not use it to register his authorship. Therefore, this procedure can only work if it becomes common practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6fb0&quot; id=&quot;6fb0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Second, Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; could break into Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;’s studio, take a photo of the painting, and place the hash in blockchain before Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;d8ab&quot; id=&quot;d8ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The reason is that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6275&quot; id=&quot;6275&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not IoT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ebcf&quot; id=&quot;ebcf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet, in general, this use case makes sense. However, it does not require anything other than Bitcoin’s blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;20cd&quot; id=&quot;20cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am talking about proof of authorship only, as the concept of intellectual property is nonsense in my opinion: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mises.org/library/against-intellectual-property-0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://mises.org/library/against-intellectual-property-0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘Against Intellectual Property’ by Stephan Kinsella&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3927&quot; id=&quot;3927&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;6. Land registry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;77dd&quot; id=&quot;77dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Another proposed case is linking blockchain-based tokens to land ownership. There are at least two issues with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e3a3&quot; id=&quot;e3a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Enforcer actions:&lt;/strong&gt; While a bottle/watch/car can be handed over peer-to-peer (P2P), land ownership and transfer must be registered by a regulatory authority, which can always physically visit your land and enforce its will. What will happen to a blockchain record if the regulatory authority insists that you should transfer your land? The first option: blockchain record still specifies you as a land owner, which is not true anymore; the second option: the regulatory authority can make its own record and thus rewrite yours, which means that blockchain doesn’t work. This is a critical point since blockchain is also promoted as a tool protecting you against the fraudulent activities of both the regulatory authorities and any individual officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71ef&quot; id=&quot;71ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Centralized development and support:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, who is going to develop such a system and support nodes? If the regulatory authority itself or its counterparty is to do the job, then such a system won’t be decentralized. A decentralized protocol plus centralized development equals a centralized protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1006&quot; id=&quot;1006&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Besides, each time somebody offers you blockchain, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1a1&quot; id=&quot;f1a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Can we use a distributed database instead?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e48&quot; id=&quot;0e48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If the answer is ‘Yes’, why go for blockchain at all? Indeed, blockchain is slower and more resource-intensive. Plus, specialists in database development and integration are much less expensive and easier to find, their work product is easier to check, and system support is simpler too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4cab&quot; id=&quot;4cab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Given all these challenges, I believe a distributed database to be a much better choice for land registry today, even though it definitely needs to become more reliable and open (see ‘Blockchain as a Trigger’ section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5145&quot; id=&quot;5145&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Indeed, it looks like this particular use case has already become a reality. Bitfury recently announced the launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://exonum.com/ru/napr&quot; data-href=&quot;https://exonum.com/ru/napr&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a blockchain land registry system built on the Exonum framework&lt;/a&gt; and is set to do the same in Ukraine and Moldova. Strangely enough, I could not find any technical details of this case, meaning that for some reason Bitfury is in no rush to boast of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3806&quot; id=&quot;3806&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;7. Interbank transfers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b18&quot; id=&quot;8b18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;This case is a good one according to the scheme from ‘Do you need blockchain?’ It involves a number of parties that do not trust each other, without any trusted third party being engaged. Although Bitcoin can be used here, banks are unlikely to make their mutual payments publicly visible. Therefore, we would offer a private blockchain where only banks themselves can input data, support nodes, and verify the transactions of all other parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed1a&quot; id=&quot;ed1a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In terms of functionality, does this system differ from a distributed database with access control? Yes, it does, but only when it comes to a disagreement between the parties. Here, the question is: will banks agree to a consensus offered by the system or will they appeal to a court? If banks can choose the second option (i.e. they have never signed an agreement to unconditionally accept all decisions offered by the system) then this system makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a10d&quot; id=&quot;a10d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Plus, this entire case will be nonsensical if regulatory bodies prohibit or restrict the use of such systems or instruct the courts to refuse system data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d095&quot; id=&quot;d095&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;8. Token for token’s sake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;69d7&quot; id=&quot;69d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Yes, that’s right! I’m actually writing about ICO in the year 2019. To prove its continued relevance, let me just point out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/bittorrent-token-is-already-nearly-6-times-its-ico-price&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/bittorrent-token-is-already-nearly-6-times-its-ico-price&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on January 28, BitTorrent had a successful ICO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8689&quot; id=&quot;8689&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What I mean by ‘Token for token’s sake’ is that some startups issue tokens and say they entitle you to a share in their companies/ profits/ split-fee options. The problem is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1104&quot; id=&quot;1104&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not IoT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c26&quot; id=&quot;0c26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Unlike venture capital investors or regulatory bodies, blockchain won’t hold a startup accountable or responsible to their investors. A promise in the form of a token alone does not oblige a company’s founders to do anything — something we saw many times during the ICO boom (remember Lambos?). In this respect, an ICO is more similar to crowd funding than an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0686&quot; id=&quot;0686&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although pro decentralized institutions and against regulatory control, I must admit there are almost no such systems in this field yet, which means you must either go for existing tools or trust company founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2a18&quot; id=&quot;2a18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, let me describe some promising use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2356&quot; id=&quot;2356&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Blockchain as a trigger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f3b6&quot; id=&quot;f3b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Oddly enough, even non-working cases may be useful. Say a corporation uses a long-outdated process/system. Instead of opting for a normal and obvious solution, management decides to invest in hype (blockchain/big data/AI/IoT) to gain a lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9698&quot; id=&quot;9698&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That’s when a savvy yet responsible &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;intrapreneur&lt;/a&gt; can offer a proper system design, marketing it as blockchain. Depending on the situation, blockchain can either give certain advantages or be not the case at all living on slick presentation slides only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f53&quot; id=&quot;8f53&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hint: If you are offered the chance to use blockchain, make sure it is actually blockchain. However, even if it is not, it could still be a sensible offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2566&quot; id=&quot;2566&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;283c&quot; id=&quot;283c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Blockchain is perfect for handling money, primarily because it was created exactly for this purpose. Blockchain records and verifies statements like ‘Party A owned X amount; Party A transferred X amount to Party B; Party B owns X amount’ as all previous similar statements were recorded within the same blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14f0&quot; id=&quot;14f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the second part of the series of his posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/decentralized-disruption-who-dares-wins-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-4-of-4-f022e8641c1a&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/decentralized-disruption-who-dares-wins-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-4-of-4-f022e8641c1a&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BitTorrent Lessons for Crypto&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/if-youre-not-breaking-rules-you-re-doing-it-wrong-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-2-of-4-72c68227fe69&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/if-youre-not-breaking-rules-you-re-doing-it-wrong-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-2-of-4-72c68227fe69&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘If You’re Not Breaking Rules You’re Doing It Wrong’,&lt;/a&gt; Simon Morris says that the original objective of decentralization is to break the rules, as those who observe those rules will try to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8983&quot; id=&quot;8983&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bitcoin meets this requirement perfectly, as it breaks the old rule according to which only the government issues money, defines issuing procedures, and decides which transaction is valid and which is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;27e7&quot; id=&quot;27e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;More importantly, I think Bitcoin performs a specific role: the transfer of value that existed long before the technology in an easy to understand manner (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘Shelling Out: The Origins of Money’ by Nick Szabo&lt;/a&gt;). At the same time, the majority of blockchain startups have to explain from the very beginning which task they solve and why — something which is nonsensical even for traditional startups that usually look for customers, test hypotheses, and try to stay in sync with the market, i.e. solve existing problems, rather than invent new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8052&quot; id=&quot;8052&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At any rate, Bitcoin is the only working blockchain application so far. That is why, at the beginning of my article, I questioned the relevance of the term ‘blockchain use’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9cc1&quot; id=&quot;9cc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I do not include cases in which blockchain is not used by end users, but rather by another blockchain that is, in turn, used by decentralized exchanges where tokens of the third blockchain are listed. Who knows, the industry may actually manage to pull itself out of the swamp this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f1dc&quot; id=&quot;f1dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Smart contracts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9687&quot; id=&quot;9687&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s be honest: nobody really knows what smart contracts are and what they are for, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1051603179526270976&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1051603179526270976&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this concept&lt;/a&gt; is still in its infancy. Ethereum is truly ahead of the curve. By the time decentralized Bitcoin came into play, people already knew and were used to e-money; by the time we got decentralized smart contracts running on Ethereum, we were still struggling to handle hard-copy contracts, while centralized smart contracts are simply non-existent yet. We can try and jump two steps at once, but to do so we need time and a viable concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2959&quot; id=&quot;2959&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Personally, I believe that smart contracts will find their niche. That’s why I am working in the field already. However, this is my personal belief, which has not been neither confirmed nor refuted yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1eab&quot; id=&quot;1eab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed5f&quot; id=&quot;ed5f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I presented the ideas described above in &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/317594640&quot; data-href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/317594640&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my speech at ETHDenver&lt;/a&gt; conference. By the way, ETHDenver was great!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mark Zuckerberg Promised a Clear History Tool Almost a Year Ago</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook spent most of 2018&lt;/strong&gt; embroiled in one scandal or another. But there was a point early on in the year when Mark Zuckerberg thought he could turn down the heat by offering a fix for the public’s privacy concerns. It was just weeks after the news broke that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had surreptitiously obtained and employed the personal data of millions of people. And as the company headed into its annual F8 developers conference in May, the chief executive proposed a dramatic change ahead of a rehearsal for the keynote address: What if they announced a tool that let users clear web-browsing information that Facebook uses to target users with ads?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestion caught people involved in the event’s production, where planning begins at least six months in advance, off guard. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-says-youll-soon-be-able-to-flush-your-browsing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clear History&lt;/a&gt;” didn’t exist; it was barely an idea. But organizers still scrambled to build its announcement into Zuckerberg's F8 keynote address. They'd already scrapped plans to unveil Portal, a video calling device that Facebook's leadership thought might be seen as too invasive given the company’s predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bold public relations play. And for those familiar with the origins of the Clear History announcement, it demonstrated not only Zuckerberg’s unilateral power over product direction, but also Facebook’s long history of prioritizing optics and convenience over substantive protections for the people who use it. Company sources who spoke to BuzzFeed News characterized Zuckerberg’s proposal as “reactionary,” a response intended to ease the negative attention on the company following the Cambridge Analytica firestorm. They also said it might explain why the Clear History tool, whose announcement was proposed on the fly by Zuckerberg, is still not available nearly a year after he introduced it on stage at F8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We really had nothing to show anyone. Mark just wanted to score some points.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;84.436955698599&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you watch the presentation, we really had nothing to show anyone,” said one person, who was close to F8. “Mark just wanted to score some points.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg do not make judgment calls “until pressure is applied,” said another former employee, who worked with Facebook's leadership and declined to be named for fear of retribution. “That pressure could come from the press or regulators, but they’re not keen on decision-making until they’re forced to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether it is with genocide or false news, there are never going to be changes until the pressure becomes too great,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has long portrayed itself as an advocate for user rights. But former employees and critics say the company's true ethos has often been in opposition to this. Facebook's communications around privacy have historically been opportunistic and protectionist, deployed to cover up for the last transgression from its &quot;move fast and break things&quot; ideology — from the 2007 Beacon program, which allowed companies to track purchases by Facebook users without their consent, to the 2010 loophole that allowed advertisers to access people’s personal Facebook information without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes we move too fast — and after listening to recent concerns, we're responding,” Zuckerberg wrote in a 2010 op-ed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/23/AR2010052303828.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. That was just before the company agreed to a Federal Trade Commission consent decree, which charged that Facebook had routinely changed users’ privacy settings in order to obtain their information. The company is currently negotiating with the FTC, which has been investigating whether or not Facebook violated the terms of that consent decree and should be punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last spring, as Facebook dealt with fallout from Cambridge Analytica, compliance with Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and renewed attention on how it tracks all internet users following Zuckerberg’s ten hours of congressional testimony in April, the company’s ask-forgiveness-not-permission playbook was in plain view. It took out full-page newspaper apologies, placed its chief executive on podcasts and televised interviews, and sent Sandberg to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-21/facebook-s-sandberg-meets-attorneys-general-behind-closed-doors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;meet with state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; and lawmakers behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My worry is that Facebook is doing anything it can to garner goodwill and diffuse concern,” said Ashkan Soltani, the FTC’s chief technologist from October 2014 to November 2015. “I’m not sure of the sincerity of those actions since, historically, the company uses privacy selectively and strategically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pl4 md-float-right&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whether it is with genocide or false news, there are never going to be changes until the pressure becomes too great.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;74.822808671065&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five former employees who spoke with BuzzFeed News say they are skeptical of that goodwill effort, with three noting that the external messaging and marketing around privacy has only become a focus for executives during the last 12 months. One pointed out that an international ad campaign last spring, focused on how “fake news” and “clickbait” “is not your friend,” was quickly repurposed to address “data misuse” days after the first Cambridge Analytica stories broke. Two highlighted Zuckerberg’s desire to rush out a Clear History announcement ahead of F8. Some ridiculed the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/facebooks-privacy-pop-up-shop-bryant-park-nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy pop-up store&lt;/a&gt; in New York City’s Bryant Park in December, which was built to show that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/social/facebooks-carolyn-everson-privacy-foundation-company/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy is the foundation of our company&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s public relations,” said one former employee. “It’s, ‘Hey, look at this shiny thing, please don’t pay attention to this mushroom cloud.’” This also appears to be the case with Clear History, which, while touted by both Sandberg and Zuckerberg in recent months as an example of Facebook’s commitment to getting privacy right, has yet to actually launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook disagreed with the characterization that privacy promises are used to distract from the real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know we have work to do to regain people's trust, and it's why we've strengthened our teams, created a new privacy and data use organization, built new tools, and set clearer policies designed to better protect people's information,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “We still face legitimate scrutiny, but we’re not the same company we were even a year ago, and we’re determined to do more to keep people safe across our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former employees, however, are not willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have a long-running strategy of using communications to disagree and push this counter-narrative against any criticism,” one said. “They’re playing the same game they’ve always played, but the challenge for them is that the world has changed and privacy concerns are increasing dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With his company&lt;/strong&gt; staring down what could reportedly be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/14/us-government-facebook-are-negotiating-record-multi-billion-dollar-fine-companys-privacy-lapses/?utm_term=.f86046b8573d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a multibillion-dollar fine&lt;/a&gt; from the FTC for violating its 2011 consent decree, Zuckerberg is acutely aware of what public perception around privacy could do to Facebook’s business. In its 2018 annual report, the company outlined not only the risks associated with changing privacy laws including GDPR and the recently passed California Consumer Privacy Act, which the company lobbied against, but also the danger of becoming the media’s punching bag if news outlets dug into Facebook’s practices around data use and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms of service, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products ... has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation,” the company stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680119000009/fb-12312018x10k.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a January financial filing&lt;/a&gt;. The statement goes on to outline the “intense media coverage” surrounding Cambridge Analytica and the possibility of negative publicity to adversely affect the company’s size, engagement, user loyalty, and, in turn, revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Facebook continues to grow — its sales, profit, and monthly active users (MAU) all increased in 2018 — there are plenty of signs that it may not be able to continue on the path. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-FACEBOOK-POLL/0100619Q2Q6/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Multiple surveys&lt;/a&gt; have shown that users are losing trust in the social network, including one where the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adweek.com/digital/consumers-dont-trust-facebook-with-personal-data-survey-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ranked last&lt;/a&gt; among brands including Amazon, Google, Visa, and Comcast that handle personal data. And that mistrust could translate to unrest among investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The list of problems the company is grappling with is vast, including complicity in a genocide, enabling social and political instability in different countries around the world, the unwitting sharing of consumer data and antagonized legislators in the US, the UK, Europe and beyond,” Pivotal Research’s Brian Wieser, one of the more bearish Facebook analysts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-07/facebook-s-biggest-bear-says-problems-likely-to-worsen-in-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote in a January report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One former employee noted that Facebook’s executives historically only took privacy seriously if problems affected the key metrics of daily active users, which totaled 1.52 billion accounts in December, or monthly active users, which totaled 2.32 billion accounts. Both figures increased by about 9% year-over-year in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If it came down to user privacy or MAU growth, Facebook always chose the latter.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;71&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If it came down to user privacy or MAU growth, Facebook always chose the latter,” the person said. That source pointed to internal Facebook emails obtained and released by a UK parliamentary inquiry that showed, among other things, the company’s then–deputy chief privacy officer Yul Kwon discussing how to allow Facebook’s Android app to read a phone’s call logs without triggering a permission pop-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Facebook’s leaders were worried about the public relations scenario that could have occurred if Android’s permissions did appear, as they were intended, to ask users to consent to the app reading their call logs. Instead of asking for less access, however, they sought a workaround so that they could still suck up the data without making people aware that they were doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a pretty high risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,” one Facebook employee, Michael LeBeau, wrote in early 2015. “We think the risk of PR fallout here is high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout, however, came more than three years after those emails, after UK parliamentarians obtained them and used them to bolster their case that Facebook operated as a “digital gangster” with little regard for law or scrutiny in a report earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws,” the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) Committee wrote in what is perhaps the strongest rebuke of the company by a governing body to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook altered a global ad campaign to include the phrase “Data misuse is not your friend” last spring following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;60.78515625&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Two people who used to work at Facebook said that it’s hard to take the company’s apologies and commitments to privacy seriously after witnessing its attempt to get ahead of outlets preparing to publish stories about Cambridge Analytica. Last March, the New York Times, the Guardian, and the Observer were readying stories about a former employee at the political consulting firm who had evidence that Cambridge Analytica had illicitly obtained data on millions of Facebook users and deployed that information for American political campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlets, according to multiple people familiar with the situation, had been in communication with Facebook about their stories for at least a week, and the company’s public relations team was well-aware that the pieces would be published on the weekend. In response, Facebook’s communications team decided to get ahead of the stories, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publishing a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the company’s deputy general counsel the preceding Friday about suspending accounts associated with Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were essentially scooping the news,” one source said, explaining that Facebook was trying to soften the blow of any future story on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the attempt, the blog post, which was picked up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/16/facebook-bans-trump-campaigns-data-analytics-firm-for-taking-user-data/?utm_term=.e16d99cc785a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, acted as an accelerant for the stories that would publish the next day. That, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/23/facebook-says-warning-to-guardian-group-not-our-wisest-move&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a legal threat&lt;/a&gt; sent to Guardian Media Group in the UK, compounded the attention and turned Cambridge Analytica into a full-blown maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were essentially scooping the news.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three former employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that there are people at Facebook who do want to put the the social network’s users first. One acknowledged Facebook’s constant privacy scandals but attributed those mistakes to a “highly decentralized company” where issues arise “less because of an act of malice, and more as unintended consequences.” Another said there are “privacy purists who care about this deeply” but that “there is an equal number of people that looks at privacy as a lever to pull to improve user sentiment and, in turn, revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg’s thinking fluctuates between both camps, that person said, favoring privacy when he realizes his company’s actions have triggered a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technology news site TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; found that Zuckerberg and other executives had been given “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/facebook-has-a-two-tiered-privacy-system-that-favors-its&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;special treatment&lt;/a&gt;” by employing a tool that deleted old messages from both a sender’s and receiver’s mailboxes. Unlike Messenger for normal users, which retains messages indefinitely and gives users no option to delete old messages, Zuckerberg had been selectively eliminating threads from 2014 and earlier, sparking outrage among some employees who didn’t understand why their chief executive had a privacy feature that wasn’t available to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sources recalled the backlash at an all-hands meeting, where several employees confronted the chief executive for secretly claiming special platform privileges that belied the company’s supposed internal dedication to transparency. In response, Zuckerberg told employees at the all-hands that the message deletion practice had come into effect because of the 2014 Sony Pictures hack to protect executives’ communications. A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the substance of internal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One source called the answer a “dodge” scripted by the company’s internal communications team, and noted Zuckerberg’s hypocrisy was in plain view: He protected his own privacy, while publicly diminishing privacy concerns that emerged in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever reactive, Facebook quickly announced plans to launch an “unsend message” tool, which would allow users to retract messages within 10 minutes of sending them. That feature, which is not at all the same thing as Zuckerberg’s ability to delete years-old messages, is now reportedly being &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/how-facebook-messenger-remove-works/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tested in certain markets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one former employee, this incident highlights a systemic issue at a company that is worth more than $450 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think these problems have been traditionally viewed as communications, policy, and legal problems, not necessarily as core product challenges, and that’s likely why they’re in this problem,” the source said. “Ultimately when comms and policy and legal have been called on to solve an issue, it means that we’re already in a crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sources told BuzzFeed News that Facebook executives continue to view the problems of 2018 fundamentally as communication issues. They said some insiders among leadership and the rank and file could not understand how Facebook had become the focus of so much public ire and floated the idea that news publications, who had seen their business models decimated by Facebook and Google, had been directed to cover the company in a harsher light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, the company invited a number of publications — including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and BuzzFeed News — for what one person called an off-the-record “media reset.” Executives including Sandberg, chief product officer Chris Cox, and augmented and virtual reality vice president Andrew “Boz” Bosworth met reporters and editors in an attempt to rebuild relationships with outlets that had been covering Facebook critically. (The author of this story learned of these talks independent of BuzzFeed News’ meeting with Facebook’s executives.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the former Facebook insiders who spoke with BuzzFeed News struggled to understand why there have been few management changes after that past year. “Certain leaders have been making bad calls,” one said, leaving the company in “crisis after crisis.” Yet aside from an executive shuffle where leaders were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17330226/facebook-reorg-mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp-messenger-ceo-blockchain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reorganized into different positions&lt;/a&gt; in May, few people, besides policy and communications head Elliot Schrage, have been shown the door. (And even Schrage still technically remains at the company in a special projects advisory role.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s an abdication of responsibility by the two at the top that runs deep — all the way down to junior leadership looking the other way,” another former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK’s DCMS committee agreed. “The management structure of Facebook is opaque to those outside the business and this seemed to be designed to conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;108.09513546798&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late last year&lt;/strong&gt;, Facebook decided to allay privacy concerns by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-hires-privacy-critics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hiring some of its biggest critics&lt;/a&gt;. In December, the company scooped up Nate Cardozo, formerly of the Electronic Frontier Foundation; Robyn Greene, from New America’s Open Technology Institute; and Nathan White, of Access Now, a digital rights foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After the privacy beating Facebook’s taken over the last year, I was skeptical too,” Cardozo, who once called the company’s business model “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/10/06/nate-cardozo-facebook-others-confuse-consumers-for-profit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;creepy&lt;/a&gt;,” wrote in a Facebook post announcing his new position. “But the privacy team I’ll be joining knows me well, and knows exactly how I feel about tech policy, privacy, and encrypted messaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hiring new people doesn't absolve Facebook for past bad practices, or guarantee future improvements,” Estelle Massé, a senior policy analyst for Access Now, wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. “Given the legacy of Facebook’s policies and practices, it will be difficult to right this ship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, Facebook’s public discussions of Clear History appear to have been more about communications strategy than charting a new course. In a Facebook post looking back on 2018, Zuckerberg pointed to the tool as one that would “give people more transparency” while Sandberg highlighted it to show Facebook’s willingness to change during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, nine months after its initial announcement, Clear History is nowhere to be found. A Facebook executive conceded in a December &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/12/17/18140062/facebook-clear-history-update-privacy-targeting-data-collection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with Recode&lt;/a&gt; that “it’s taking longer than we initially thought” due to issues with how data is stored and processed. The company will now reportedly start testing the tool in the spring led by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17331268/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-privacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new privacy product unit&lt;/a&gt; Zuckerberg created last May amid various scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to make sure this works the way it should for everyone on Facebook, which is taking longer than expected,” the company said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if new high-profile hires, like Cardozo and Greene, will work with Facebook’s new privacy unit or if they will be involved with Clear History. (Zuckerberg did say last May that the company would be working with “privacy advocates” on its new tool to “make sure we get it right.”) It has reached out to groups like Access Now, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), as well as academics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources confirmed that CDT and EFF were advising Facebook on its Clear History tool, but could not disclose specifics of their meetings due to nondisclosure agreements. Access Now’s Massé confirmed Facebook had reached out on a number of issues, including Clear History, in the last few months, but called the conversations “punctual and limited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite repeated statements and apologies from the company, we are not seeing a shift in Facebook data practices or an attitude that would suggest that they take data protection seriously,” she said. “What we are seeing so far are reactionary measures in an attempt to sway public opinion, rather than a fundamental shift in the way the company considers users’ rights to privacy and data protection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pl4 md-float-right&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There could be a gap between what Facebook says it’s deleting and what they’re actually deleting.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;92.865366759517&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy experts also pushed back on the idea that Clear History could be a cure-all for Facebook’s privacy ails. For one, it’s still unclear what the tool will allow users to delete and, as the CDT’s Natasha Duarte notes, features like these don’t necessarily guarantee better privacy. “The tool may be able to delete information that Facebook holds about a user’s interaction with other websites, but inferences from those interactions may already be incorporated into Facebook’s algorithm,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine if a user visited a site for Dyson vacuums and Facebook registered that interaction through a tracker. Clear History might let a user remove information about that Dyson site visit from Facebook’s servers, but if that information has already been collected and algorithmically processed into a preference for ads about other household cleaning products, clearing history doesn't mean much. As Duarte explained: “There could be a gap between what Facebook says it’s deleting and what it is actually deleting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former insiders were also concerned about how much Facebook would emphasize or promote Clear History after launch, noting that past privacy features have sometimes been introduced with minimum functionality and high amounts of friction to possibly discourage users. One former employee cited a feature that allows users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992?helpref=hc_global_nav&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;download all their Facebook information&lt;/a&gt;, but noted that it was hard to find and created file formats that were hard to read and share. Another recalled how the company unveiled a tool for “Nearby Friends,” but required “an inordinate number of clicks” to turn off the feature, which then defaulted to only pausing a user’s involvement for a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like a douchey move, and it was unclear if it was a deliberate choice or poor design,” the employee said. (A Facebook spokesperson disagreed with these characterizations and said the company builds controls “so that people will be able to easily find and use them.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the last 12 months, Facebook has lost that benefit of the doubt, according to privacy experts, and Clear History may be too little, too late. Groups including Access Now and CDT are calling for policymakers to step in, and even the social network’s executives seem resigned to some type of eventual privacy law in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facebook has made good on just about every opportunity to lower expectations that it would protect user privacy without a government forcing it to,” Massé told BuzzFeed News. “It is high time for the US to adopt comprehensive data protection legislation to bring sectorwide safeguards for our personal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s track record speaks for itself, said Gennie Gebhart, a consumer privacy researcher at EFF. Gebhart, who’s been in discussions with Facebook about Clear History, noted that she maintains a certain skepticism that the company is capable of deeper change, and compared its past privacy promises to rearranging deck chairs on the &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re focused on solving the problem of needing to be seen like they're doing something, rather than solving the actual problem,” she said. “And that needs to change.”●&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
