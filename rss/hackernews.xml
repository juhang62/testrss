&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Facebook admitted that it was asking some users who signed up on desktop while using email addresses not supporting the OAuth open standard to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-just-casually-asking-some-new-users-for-the-1833764891&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-just-casually-asking-some-new-users-for-the-1833764891', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;give them the passwords&lt;/a&gt; to their email accounts—with options to avoid doing so hidden in a “Need Help?” sub-menu. Now the social media giant has admitted that yes, it did “unintentionally” upload contact lists from up to 1.5 million of those email accounts to Facebook, without their owners’ consent or knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation security expert Bennett Cyphers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asks-new-users-email-passwords-2019-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asks-new-users-email-passwords-2019-4', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;told Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that asking users to hand over account credentials as part of a registration process is “basically indistinguishable to a phishing attack.” Per a Wednesday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-uploaded-1-5-million-users-email-contacts-without-permission-2019-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-uploaded-1-5-million-users-email-contacts-without-permission-2019-4', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;report in Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook has now said that it automatically extracted contact lists from around 1.5 million email accounts it was given access to via this method without ever actually asking for their permission. Again, this is exactly the type of thing one would expect to see in a phishing attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook told Gizmodo via email that in May 2016 it made a revision to the registration process, which originally asked the affected users for permission to upload contact lists. That change removed the opt-in prompt, though the company did not realize the underlying functionality was still operating in some cases. It seems that the only way a user would necessarily be aware of this prior to account activation would be if they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asks-new-users-email-passwords-2019-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asks-new-users-email-passwords-2019-4', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;caught a pop-up&lt;/a&gt; stating that Facebook is “importing contacts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook says it never saw the contents of any emails, according to Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson told Gizmodo via phone earlier this month that “The intent of this option was simply to confirm the account.” However, Facebook confirmed to Gizmodo on Wednesday that the contact information was used for friend suggestions (i.e. its &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/people-you-may-know-a-controversial-facebook-features-1827981959&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/people-you-may-know-a-controversial-facebook-features-1827981959', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;oft-unsettling “People You May Know” feature&lt;/a&gt;) and to improve ads (in other words, for targeted advertising purposes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Facebook spokesperson also told Gizmodo that a screenshot of the original opt-in prompt was not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the company wrote that it would be notifying the 1.5 million impacted users, as well as deleting any contacts it obtained without their knowledge or consent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month we stopped offering email password verification as an option for people verifying their account when signing up for Facebook for the first time. When we looked into the steps people were going through to verify their accounts we found that in some cases people’s email contacts were also unintentionally uploaded to Facebook when they created their account. We estimate that up to 1.5 million people’s email contacts may have been uploaded. These contacts were not shared with anyone and we’re deleting them. We’ve fixed the underlying issue and are notifying people whose contacts were imported. People can also review and manage the contacts they share with Facebook in their settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;the Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt; originally confirmed that some users were being asked to provide email passwords by “using a disposable webmail address and connecting through a VPN in Romania.” Romania is a member state of the European Union, which implemented the sweeping General Data Privacy Regulation (requiring explicit, freely given, and informed consent to process personal data) last year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the umpteenth time in recent memory that Facebook has been found to have done something its users might not appreciate. Notable recent controversies at the company have included the use two-factor authentication as a pretext to obtain phone numbers &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-turned-its-two-factor-security-feature-into-th-1823006334&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-turned-its-two-factor-security-feature-into-th-1823006334', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;for notifications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;targeted advertising&lt;/a&gt;, using pseudo-VPN apps to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/surprise-facebook-low-balled-the-percentage-of-teens-i-1833000029&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/surprise-facebook-low-balled-the-percentage-of-teens-i-1833000029', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;vacuum up extensive information&lt;/a&gt; on users’ mobile habits, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-s-defense-for-sucking-up-your-call-and-text-da-1824072352&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-s-defense-for-sucking-up-your-call-and-text-da-1824072352', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;seemingly obfuscating&lt;/a&gt; prompts to share call and text metadata, and storing passwords &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-passwords-acces-1833466094&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-passwords-acces-1833466094', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook &amp;#039;unintentionally uploaded&amp;#039; 1.5M people&amp;#039;s email contacts without consent</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-uploaded-1-5-million-users-email-contacts-without-permission-2019-4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-uploaded-1-5-million-users-email-contacts-without-permission-2019-4</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook harvested the email contacts of 1.5 million users without their knowledge or consent when they opened their accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since May 2016, the social-networking company has collected the contact lists of 1.5 million users new to the social network, Business Insider can reveal. The Silicon Valley company said the contact data was &quot;unintentionally uploaded to Facebook,&quot; and it is now deleting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The revelation comes after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/originalesushi/status/1112496649891430401&quot;&gt;pseudononymous security researcher e-sushi noticed&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook was asking some users to enter their email passwords when they signed up for new accounts to verify their identities, a move widely condemned by security experts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-asks-new-users-email-passwords-2019-4&quot;&gt;Business Insider then discovered that if you entered your email password&lt;/a&gt;, a message popped up saying it was &quot;importing&quot; your contacts without asking for permission first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the time, it wasn't clear what was happening — but on Wednesday, Facebook disclosed to Business Insider that 1.5 million people's contacts were collected this way and fed into Facebook's systems, where they were used to improve Facebook's ad targeting, build Facebook's web of social connections, and recommend friends to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said before May 2016, it offered an option to verify a user's account using their email password and voluntarily upload their contacts at the same time. However, they said, the company changed the feature, and the text informing users that their contacts would be uploaded was deleted — but the underlying functionality was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook didn't access the content of users' emails, the spokesperson added. But users' contacts can still be highly sensitive data — revealing who people are communicating with and connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;While 1.5 million people's contact books were directly harvested by Facebook, the total number of people whose contact information was improperly obtained by Facebook may well be in the dozens or even hundreds of millions, as people sometimes have hundreds of contacts stored on their email accounts. The spokesperson could not provide a figure for the total number of contacts obtained this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Users weren't given any warning before their contact data was grabbed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The screenshot below shows the password entry page users saw upon sign up. After they entered their password and clicked the blue &quot;connect&quot; button, Facebook would begin harvesting users' email contact data without asking for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Screenshot/Business Insider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;After clicking the blue &quot;connect&quot; button, a dialog box (screenshot below) popped up saying &quot;importing contacts.&quot; There was no way to opt out, cancel the process, or interrupt it midway through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Business Insider discovered this was happening by signing up for Facebook with a fake account before Facebook discontinued the password verification feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Screenshot/Rob Price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;&quot;&gt;From one crisis to another&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The incident is the latest privacy misstep from the beleaguered technology giant, which has lurched from scandal to scandal over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in early 2018, when it emerged that the political firm had illicitly harvested tens of millions of Facebook users' data, the company's approach to handling users' data has come under intense scrutiny. More recently, in March 2019, t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-millions-users-passwords-stored-plain-text-2019-3&quot;&gt;he company disclosed that it was inadvertently storing hundreds of millions of users' account passwords in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, contrary to security best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Facebook now plans to notify the 1.5 million users affected over the coming days and delete their contacts from the company's systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Last month we stopped offering email password verification as an option for people verifying their account when signing up for Facebook for the first time. When we looked into the steps people were going through to verify their accounts we found that in some cases people's email contacts were also unintentionally uploaded to Facebook when they created their account,&quot; the spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;We estimate that up to 1.5 million people's email contacts may have been uploaded. These contacts were not shared with anyone and we're deleting them. We've fixed the underlying issue and are notifying people whose contacts were imported. People can also review and manage the contacts they share with Facebook in their settings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, we are a team at Microsoft called Bling (Beyond Language Understanding), we help Bing be smarter. Here we wanted to share with all of you our &lt;strong&gt;FI&lt;/strong&gt;nite State machine and &lt;strong&gt;RE&lt;/strong&gt;gular expression manipulation library (&lt;strong&gt;FIRE&lt;/strong&gt;). We use Fire for many linguistic operations inside Bing such as Tokenization, Multi-word expression matching, Unknown word-guessing, Stemming / Lemmatization just to mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bling Fire Tokenizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bling Fire Tokenizer is a tokenizer designed for fast-speed and quality tokenization of Natural Language text. It mostly follows the tokenization logic of NLTK, except hyphenated words are split and a few errors are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NLTK:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
The South &lt;strong&gt;Florida/Miami&lt;/strong&gt; area has previously hosted the event 10 times .
Names such as French , ( De ) Roche , Devereux , &lt;strong&gt;D'Arcy&lt;/strong&gt; , Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland .

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently released model supports most of the languages except East Asian (Chinese Simplified, Traditional, Japanese, Korean, Thai). You should expect good results if a language uses space as a main token delimitter. The tokenizer high level API designed in a way that it requires 0 configuration, or initialization, or additional files and is friendly for use from languages like Python, Perl, C#, Java, etc. It is fast as uses deterministic finite state machines underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmarking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing Bling Fire with other popular NLP libraries, Bling Fire shows &lt;strong&gt;10X faster&lt;/strong&gt; speed in tokenization task&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start using Bling Fire Library and Finite State Machine manipulation tools, you can build the project on Windows/Linux with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmake.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CMake&lt;/a&gt;. You need this if you want to create your own tokenization / segmentation, stemming etc. logic or need finite state machines for any other need. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/wiki/How-to-change-linguistic-resources&quot;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you simply want to use it in Python, you can install the latest release using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/pip/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install blingfire&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; blingfire &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
text &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;This is the Bling-Fire tokenizer&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
output &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; text_to_words(text)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Jupyter Notebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/BlingFire/blob/master/doc/Bling%20Fire%20Tokenizer%20Demo.ipynb&quot;&gt;This notebook&lt;/a&gt; demostrates how Bling Fire tokenizer helps in Stack Overflow posts classification problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://cla.microsoft.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://cla.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;. For more information see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct FAQ&lt;/a&gt; or contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:opencode@microsoft.com&quot;&gt;opencode@microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt; with any additional questions or comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working Branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To contribute directly to code base, you should create a personal fork and create feature branches there when you need them. This keeps the main repository clean and your personal workflow out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pull Request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Contributor License Agreement (CLA)&lt;/a&gt;. It is an automated process and you only need to do it once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual. When your pull-request is created, it is classified by a CLA bot. If the change is trivial (i.e. you just fixed a typo) then the PR is labelled with &lt;code&gt;cla-not-required&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, it's classified as &lt;code&gt;cla-required&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, the system will also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you have signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labelled as &lt;code&gt;cla-signed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions&quot;&gt;link the issue in the pull request&lt;/a&gt; if possible. Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Besides, keep code changes as small as possible and avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reporting Security Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:secure@microsoft.com&quot;&gt;secure@microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

<title>I found two identical packs of Skittles among 468 packs</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2019/01/09/identical-packs-of-skittles/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year discussing the likelihood of encountering two identical packs of Skittles, that is, two packs having exactly the same number of candies of each flavor. Under some reasonable assumptions, it was estimated that we should expect to have to inspect “only about 400-500 packs” on average until encountering a first duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on 12 January of this year, I started buying boxes of packs of Skittles. This past week, “only” 82 days, 13 boxes, 468 packs, and 27,740 individual Skittles later, I found the following identical 2.17-ounce packs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2019/04/06/follow-up-i-found-two-identical-packs-of-skittles-among-468-packs-with-a-total-of-27740-skittles/skittles_identical/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3192&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;3192&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2019/04/06/follow-up-i-found-two-identical-packs-of-skittles-among-468-packs-with-a-total-of-27740-skittles/skittles_identical/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;819,347&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;skittles_identical&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271?w=640&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3192&quot; src=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;271&quot; srcset=&quot;https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=271 640w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=150&amp;amp;h=64 150w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=127 300w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png?w=768&amp;amp;h=325 768w, https://possiblywrong.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/skittles_identical.png 819w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased all of the 2.17-ounce packs of Skittles for this experiment from Amazon in boxes of 36 packs each. From 12 January through 4 April, I worked my way through 13 boxes, for a total of 468 packs, at the approximate rate of six packs per day. This was enough to feel like I was making progress each day, but not enough to become annoying or risk clerical errors. For each six-pack recording session, I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a pack from the box, open it, and empty and sort the contents onto a blank sheet of paper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a photo of the contents of the pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record, with pen and paper, the number of Skittles of each color in the pack (more on this later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty the Skittles into a bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 1-4; after six packs, save and review the photos, recording the color counts to file, verifying against the paper record from step 3, and checking for duplication of a previously recorded pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photos captured all of the contents of each pack, including any small flakes and chips of flavored coating that were easy to disregard… but also larger “chunks” of misshapen paste that were often only partially coated or not at all, that required some criteria up front to determine whether or how to count. For this experiment, my threshold for counting a chunk was answering “Yes” to all three of (a) is it greater than half the size of a “normal” Skittle, (b) is it completely coated with a single clearly identifiable flavor color, and (c) is it not gross, that is, would I be willing to eat it? Any “No” answer resulted in recording that pack as containing “uncounted” material, such as the pack shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3199&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;All 468 packs of Skittles, arranged top to bottom, in columns left to right. Each pair of columns corresponds to a box of 36 packs. The two identical packs are circled in red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But… why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the point? Why bother with nearly three months of effort to collect this data? One easy answer is that I simply found it interesting. But I think a better answer is that this seemed like a great opportunity to demonstrate the &lt;em&gt;predictive power&lt;/em&gt; of mathematics. A few months ago, we did some calculations on a cocktail napkin, so to speak, &lt;em&gt;predicting&lt;/em&gt; that we should be able to find a pair of identical packs of Skittles with a reasonably– and perhaps surprisingly– small amount of effort. Actually seeing that effort through to the finish line can be a vivid demonstration for students of this predictive power of what might otherwise be viewed as “merely abstract” and not concretely useful mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, I think the fact that this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; concrete application happens to be recreational, or even downright frivolous, is beside the point. For one thing, recreational mathematics is fun. But perhaps more importantly, there are useful, non-recreational, “real-world” applications &lt;em&gt;of the same underlying mathematics&lt;/em&gt;. Cryptography is one such example application; this experiment is really just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack&quot;&gt;birthday attack&lt;/a&gt; in slightly more complicated form.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions and predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For completeness, let’s review the approach discussed in the previous post for estimating the number of packs we need to inspect to find a duplicate. We assume that the color of each individual Skittle is independently and uniformly distributed among the &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D5&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;d=5&quot; title=&quot;d=5&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; possible flavors (strawberry, orange, lemon, green apple, and grape). We further assume that the total number &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;n&quot; title=&quot;n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; of Skittles in a pack is independently distributed with density &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, where we guessed at &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; based on similar past studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use generating functions to compute the probability &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;q&quot; title=&quot;q&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; that two &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; randomly selected packs of Skittles would be identical, where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3D+%5Csum_n+f%28n%29%5E2+p%28n%2C5%29+&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=2&quot; alt=&quot;q = \sum_n f(n)^2 p(n,5) &quot; title=&quot;q = \sum_n f(n)^2 p(n,5) &quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28n%2Cd%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bd%5E%7B2n%7D%7D%5B%5Cfrac%7Bx%5E%7B2n%7D%7D%7B%28n%21%29%5E2%7D%5D%28%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5En+%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%5Ek%7D%7Bk%21%7D%29%5E2%29%5Ed+&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=2&quot; alt=&quot;p(n,d) = \frac{1}{d^{2n}}[\frac{x^{2n}}{(n!)^2}](\sum_{k=0}^n (\frac{x^k}{k!})^2)^d &quot; title=&quot;p(n,d) = \frac{1}{d^{2n}}[\frac{x^{2n}}{(n!)^2}](\sum_{k=0}^n (\frac{x^k}{k!})^2)^d &quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, a reasonable approximation of the expected number of packs we need to inspect until encountering a first duplicate is &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cpi+%2F+%282q%29%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\sqrt{\pi / (2q)}&quot; title=&quot;\sqrt{\pi / (2q)}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, or about 400-500 packs depending on our assumption for the pack size density &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common and controversial question asked about Skittles seems to be whether all five flavors are indeed uniformly distributed, or whether some flavors are more common than others. The following figure shows the distribution observed in this sample of 468 packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3210&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Average number of Skittles of each flavor in a pack. The assumed uniform average of 11.8547 Skittles of each color is shown by the black line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat unfortunately, this data set potentially adds fuel to the frequent accusation that the yellow Skittles dominate. However, I leave it to an interested reader to consider and analyze whether this departure from uniformity is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How accurate was our prior assumed distribution &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(n)&quot; title=&quot;f(n)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; for the total number of Skittles in each pack? The following figure shows the observed distribution from this sample of 468 packs, with the mean of 59.2735 Skittles per pack shown in red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although our prior assumed average of 60 Skittles per pack was reasonable, there is strong evidence against our assumption of independence from one pack to the next, as shown in the following figure. The &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;-axis indicates the pack number from 1 to 468, and the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;-axis indicates the number of Skittles in the pack, either total (in black) or of each individual color. The vertical grid lines show the grouping of 36 packs per box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-3207&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Number of Skittles per pack (total and of each color) vs. pack number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colored curves at bottom really just indicate the frequency and extent of outliers for the individual flavors; for example, we can see that every color appeared on at least 2 and at most 24 Skittles in every pack. The most interesting aspect of this figure, though, is the &lt;em&gt;consecutive&lt;/em&gt; spikes in &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; number of Skittles shown by the black curve, with the minimum of 45 Skittles in pack #291 immediately followed by the maximum of 73 Skittles in pack #292. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5hdtd9/got_ticked_off_about_skittles_posts_so_i_decided/&quot;&gt;this past analysis&lt;/a&gt; of a single box of 36 packs that shows similar behavior.) This suggests that the dispenser that fills each pack targets an amortized rate of weight or perhaps volume, got jammed somehow resulting in an underfilled pack, and in getting “unjammed” &lt;em&gt;overfilled&lt;/em&gt; the subsequent pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is admittedly just speculation; note, for example, that the 36 packs in each box are relatively free to shift around, and I made only a modest effort to pull packs from each box in a consistent “top to bottom, front to back” order as I recorded them. So although each &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; of 36 packs in this data set definitely come from the same box, the &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; of packs within each group of 36 does not necessarily correspond to the order in which the packs were filled at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, if the objective of this experiment were to obtain a representative “truly random” sample of packs of Skittles, then the above behavior suggests that buying these 36-pack boxes in bulk is probably not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stopping rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one additional caveat: fortunately the primary objective of this experiment was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to obtain a “truly random” sample, but only to confirm the predicted “ease” with which we could find a pair of identical packs of Skittles. However, suppose that we &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; want to use this data set as a “truly random” sample… and further suppose that we could eliminate the practical imperfections suggested above, so that each pack was indeed a theoretically perfect, independent random sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then even in this clean room thought experiment, we &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have a problem: by stopping our sampling procedure upon encountering a duplicate, we have biased the distribution of possible resulting sample data sets! This can perhaps be most clearly seen with a simpler setup that allows an analytical solution: suppose that each pack contains just &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;n=2&quot; title=&quot;n=2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; Skittles, and each individual Skittle is independently equally likely to be one of just &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3D2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;d=2&quot; title=&quot;d=2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; possible colors, red or green. If we collect any &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; number of sample packs, then we should expect to observe an “all-red” pack with two red Skittles exactly 1/4 of the time. But if we instead collect sample packs until we observe a first duplicate, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; count the fraction that are all red, the expected value of this fraction is slightly less than 1/4 (181/768, to be exact). That is, by stopping with a duplicate, we are less likely to even get a chance to observe the more rare all-red (or all-green) packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting problem to quantify the extent of this effect (which I suspect is vanishingly small) with actual packs of Skittles, where the numbers of candies are larger, and the probabilities of those “extreme” compositions such as all reds is so small as to be effectively zero.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Once it was easy to be obscure, but technology has ended that</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We are constantly exposed in public. Yet most of our actions will fade into &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2439866&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;obscurity&lt;/a&gt;. Do you, for example, remember the faces of strangers who stood in line with you the last time you bought medicine at a drugstore? Probably not. Thanks to limited memory and norms against staring, they probably don’t remember yours either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is what it means to be obscure. And our failure to collectively value this idea shows where we’ve gone wrong in the debates over data and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Lawmakers and industry leaders are missing the big picture. They are stuck on traditional concepts like “transparency,” “consent” and “secrecy,” which leads to proposals that reinforce broken mechanisms like &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/trustissues/user-agreements-are-betraying-you-19db7135441f&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consenting to unreadable terms of service&lt;/a&gt;. They are operating under the dangerous illusion that there’s a clear distinction between what’s public and what’s private. Most people probably intuitively know that their most deeply held secrets are private while the things about them that are commonly known or widely broadcast  are not. But what about information about our everyday actions that is shared with some but not all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Obscurity bridges this privacy gap with the idea that the parts of our lives that are hard or unlikely to be found or understood are relatively safe. It is a combination of the privacy you have in public and the privacy you have in groups. Obscurity  is a barrier that can shield you from government, corporate and social snoops. And until lawmakers, corporate leaders and citizens embrace obscurity and move to protect it, your freedom and opportunities to flourish will be in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The concept was first meaningfully articulated in a landmark 1989 Supreme Court decision, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/87-1379&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press&lt;/a&gt;, which recognized a privacy interest in the “practical obscurity” of information that was technically available to the public but could be found only by spending an unrealistic amount of time and effort. After the concept was introduced, most lawmakers, judges and the tech industry promptly forgot about it. This has dulled the potential of obscurity as a rallying point for change and leaves society struggling to protect something in dire need of defining and defending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Understanding obscurity means paying attention to how space, time and people’s cognitive limitations make it difficult for others to surveil us or find out things about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Consider space. The further away people are, the harder it is to see with the naked eye who they are and where they’re going. Usually, we are visible only to those nearby. But cellphone location data can reveal that same highly personal information to anyone with means and motivation. We should be disturbed that apps often &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftc.gov%2Fnews-events%2Fpress-releases%2F2013%2F12%2Fandroid-flashlight-app-developer-settles-ftc-charges-it-deceived&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7Cw.hartzog%40northeastern.edu%7C51a5443e3c864562254608d6c2ae9d8e%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C636910452592183627&amp;amp;sdata=PwMlL3cfeJ6z%2FxxtQ3USSMxSX%2F2jp9fFniFeH8NE1R4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;collect location data&lt;/a&gt; simply because they can and that T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Ftech-policy%2F2019%2F02%2Fatt-t-mobile-sprint-reportedly-broke-us-law-by-selling-911-location-data%2F&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7Cw.hartzog%40northeastern.edu%7C51a5443e3c864562254608d6c2ae9d8e%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C636910452592193641&amp;amp;sdata=sJKDXlLUbv%2BXiyjzHPqki0GaaGCO17UuwlFE3fe3Ib8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reportedly have illegally sold&lt;/a&gt; customers’ 911 location data to third parties. And we should be pleased that the  Supreme Court ruled last year in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-402&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carpenter vs. United States&lt;/a&gt; that, under the Fourth Amendment, cellphone records can’t be seized without a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Consider time. Memories fade as time passes. But the internet has impeccable recall. That’s why we should applaud the senators who have proposed a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Leg%20text%20--Markey-Hawley%203.11.19%20FINAL.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bipartisan update&lt;/a&gt; to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act that would give parents and children an “eraser button” to remove a child’s data from platforms like Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It’s also why we should be skeptical of Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that Facebook will become a more “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy-focused platform&lt;/a&gt;” that emphasizes features like ephemeral, expiring information. Truly ephemeral communications are certainly obscure, but it’s unclear what information Facebook will scrub on the front end (for users) and the back end (from the company). The company’s history suggests we shouldn’t let our guard down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Obscurity is also a better way to understand Europe’s “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/05/google-cant-forget-you-but-it-should-make-you-hard-to-find/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right to be forgotten&lt;/a&gt;” law, which can’t make anyone forget anything, but can make the remnants of your awkward youth harder to find online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, consider cognitive limitations. Facial recognition technology poses an immense danger to society because it can be used to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/story/facial-recognition-is-the-perfect-tool-for-oppression-bc2a08f0fe66&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overcome biological constraints&lt;/a&gt; on how many individuals anyone can recognize in real time. If its use continues to grow and the right regulations aren’t instituted, we might lose the ability to go out in public without being recognized by the police, our neighbors and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Creating strong regulations for the technology is going to be an uphill battle, especially because it’s already become widespread, being &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/us/politics/facial-recognition-airports-privacy.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;deployed at airports&lt;/a&gt; to make boarding easier and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/new-york-school-district-seeks-facial-recognition&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adopted by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/new-york-school-district-seeks-facial-recognition&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;schools&lt;/a&gt; to increase safety. It is even being used at &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/07/17/facial-recognition-helps-mom-and-dad-see-kids-camp-photos-raises-privacy-concerns-some/780725002/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;summer camps&lt;/a&gt; so parents can automatically receive photos in which their children appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Threats to our obscurity are growing because technology is making our personal information easy and cheap to aggregate, archive and interpret — with substantial growth in predictive analytics, too. To see what we mean, just look yourself up on the website &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mylife.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MyLife&lt;/a&gt; and marvel at how much information has been cobbled together from different moments in your life for anyone to see at the click of a button. Even speaking in hushed tones to a friend at a crowded cafe might not be enough to protect your obscurity if cameras are someday equipped with &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/lip-reading-artificial-intelligence-could-help-deaf-or-spies&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lip-reading artificial intelligence software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Obscurity is vital to our well-being for several reasons. It gives us breathing room to go about our daily routines with little fear of being judged, sent unwanted ads, gossiped about or needlessly shamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;to explore what’s at stake and what you can do about it.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Obscurity makes meaningful and intimate relationships possible, ones that offer solidarity, loyalty and love. It allows us to choose with whom we want to share different kinds of information. It protects us from having everyone know the different roles we play in the different parts of our lives. We need to be able to play one role with our co-workers while revealing other parts of ourselves with friends and family. Indeed, obscurity is one reason we feel safe bonding with others over our shared vulnerabilities, our mutual hopes, dreams and fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Obscurity enables us to develop and grow as individuals. It provides us collectively with spaces to explore new and controversial possibilities, to transgress taboos and ignore arbitrary rules. You might have thought you could skip church without anyone knowing, but churches are &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://churchix.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;being marketed&lt;/a&gt; facial recognition systems that will make sure your absences are duly noted. It won’t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Obscurity protects us from being pressured to be conventional. This buffer from a ubiquitous permanent record is especially important for the exploratory phase of youth. To develop as humans, people must be free to try things they might later regret. This is how we become better people. Without obscurity, we wouldn’t have the freedom to take risks, fail and dust ourselves off. We’d be stymied by the fear of being deemed failures by a system that never forgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Finally, obscurity is crucial to democracy. Obscurity fosters civic participation and gives us the confidence to attend political protests and engage in political speech online without worrying about ending up on a government watch list. It’s why the American Civil Liberties Union worries about the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/internet-speech/fbi-can-neither-confirm-nor-deny-it-monitors-your-social-media&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;government monitoring&lt;/a&gt; social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Things can be private even if others can see them. And there is so much of our lives that industry and governments have yet to find. But in our status-obsessed culture, it can be hard to appreciate that the opposite of obscurity isn’t fame, but chillingly oppressive fear.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Popular Google Play store apps are abusing permissions and committing ad fraud</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;flex xs-flex-column&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subbuzz__attribution js-subbuzz__attribution xs-text-6 xs-block&quot;&gt;Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed News&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;91.968045112782&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A host of&lt;/strong&gt; popular Android apps from a major Chinese developer, including a selfie app with more than 50 million downloads, have been committing large-scale ad fraud and abusing user permissions, a BuzzFeed News investigation of popular Android apps has found. In several cases, the apps took steps that concealed their connections to the developer, DU Group, to users and failed to clearly disclose they were collecting and sending data to China. The investigation also raises questions about Google's policing of apps in the Play store for fraud and data collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group is a Chinese app developer that claims more than 1 billion users worldwide, and was spun off from Baidu, one of China’s largest tech companies, last year. At least six of DU Group’s apps, which together have more than 90 million downloads from the Google Play store, have been fraudulently clicking on ads to generate revenue, and at least two of them contain code that could be used to engage in a different form of ad fraud, according to findings from security and ad fraud researchers Check Point and Method Media Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DU Group apps were identified after BuzzFeed News gathered a list of close to 5,000 popular apps from the Google Play store, along with associated information, such as the developer’s name, number of installs, and requested permissions. Apps that asked for a suspiciously large number of user permissions, or permissions deemed potentially &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#dangerous_permissions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“dangerous”&lt;/a&gt; by Android, were provided to researchers at several data analysis and security firms. (For a more detailed description of the methodology, see the bottom of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t limited to DU Group, however. Other Android apps with a high number of unnecessary permissions identified by BuzzFeed News include a hugely popular TV remote app that says it might use a phone’s microphone to record sound while a user watches TV, a Chinese-language kids app that sent personal information without any encryption to servers in China, and a flashlight app that took dozens of unnecessary and potentially invasive permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate how Google’s Play store, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessofapps.com/guide/app-stores-list/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; app store in the world, has been exploited by developers who easily conceal who they are from users, offer apps with invasive permissions, and use these permissions to commit ad fraud — all while collecting huge amounts of user data. The result is an app ecosystem that’s easily taken advantage of to abuse users and steal money from advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google told BuzzFeed News that it has blacklisted the six DU Group apps found committing ad fraud. This means they can no longer use any of Google’s ad products to earn money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We explicitly prohibit ad fraud and service abuse on Google Play. Developers are required to disclose the collection of personal data, and only use permissions that are needed to deliver the features within the app,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “If an app violates &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/#!?modal_active=none&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our policies&lt;/a&gt;, we take action that can include banning a developer from being able to publish on Play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s Play store, the largest app store in the world, has been exploited by developers who easily conceal who they are from users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;84.679611650485&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DU apps in question also violate the Play store policy against apps that “misrepresent or conceal their ownership,” given that they do not disclose any connection to DU Group to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After initially stating that the apps in question would remain in its store while it investigated, shortly before this article's publication a Google spokesperson confirmed they have now been removed. The company would not say if it plans to take action against DU Group overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before Google responded to BuzzFeed News’ questions about app permissions and developers concealing their identity, the company also published &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/04/improving-update-process-with-your.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlining a new approach to user permissions and measures “to prevent bad-faith developers from gaming our systems.” It said it will be hiring more people to evaluate apps for the Play store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group did not respond to multiple emails requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Kramer, a senior analyst of Arete Research, told BuzzFeed News Google isn’t doing enough to protect users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You cannot separate the behaviour of DU — spun out of Baidu a year ago, in which they still own 34% — from the US-listed parent,” he said in an email. “Ad fraud is simply the norm in China (and for many other apps), and ... Google should be doing far more to prevent it, even if it would materially reduce sales. They cannot claim ignorance of, or deny the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group’s ad fraud follows on previous BuzzFeed News reporting that revealed two other prominent Chinese Android app developers, Cheetah Mobile and Kika Tech, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/android-apps-cheetah-mobile-kika-kochava-ad-fraud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;were abusing user permissions to engage in ad fraud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that investigation, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/mark-warner-cheetah-mobile-chinese-apps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said Chinese mobile app companies pose a national security risk&lt;/a&gt; due to their voracious data collection and Chinese laws that make them “ultimately beholden to the Communist Party.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All this information is ending back up in data repositories in China. Beyond the [ad] fraud, just all the personal information that is being collected on Americans” is a problem, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant Simmons, the head of client analytics for the app analysis and attribution company Kochava, said the behaviors identified in this investigation often occur in the background when a user isn’t using the app in question. He compared it to “having downloaded an app that operates as a Trojan horse for the purposes of data collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“End users are not aware of how data is generated by the apps they use — and how frequently the data generated is used for ad fraud or further privacy violations,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A review of app privacy policies by Privacy International found many identified in this research were confusing or inadequate, and raised questions about when they share data with government authorities and other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beyond questions of legal compliance, companies need to stop exploiting people’s data,” said Frederike Kaltheuner, the data program lead of Privacy International. “What happens to your data matters, because it can be used against you or for purposes that you fundamentally disagree with. At the moment you often have to [be] an expert to understand what happens to your data —  with whom it’s shared, sold, and by whom it’s exploited. That’s a huge problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A family of apps committing ad fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pic.mycamera&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Selfie Camera&lt;/a&gt; app had been installed more than 50 million times from the Google Play store, and maintained a 4.5-star rating after tens of thousands of reviews. In 2017, Google listed it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/best-apps-of-2017-revealed-by-google/ar-BBG6WGe?li=BBnbklF&amp;amp;%25252525253Bocid=LENDHP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as one of the most popular new apps in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Those stats made it seem like a safe bet for users, but three different researchers found problems with the app that make it a risk to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most alarmingly, Check Point found the app contains code that causes it to fraudulently click on ads in the app without the user’s knowledge. The company’s researchers documented fake clicks taking place with ads served by AdMob and MoPub, the mobile ad networks operated by Google and Twitter, respectively. (MoPub and Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraudulent clicks even occur when the app isn’t open, which can drain a phone’s battery and consume data, according to Aviran Hazum, the analysis and response team leader for Check Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His team documented the app “checking if [a] user hasn’t clicked on an ad yet [and then] clicking at random intervals” on ads to generate fraudulent revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you can say is in the gray area — it's a clear-cut fraudulent activity,” he told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selfie Camera is one of six apps owned by DU Group that Check Point found engaged in fake ad clicking. The other apps were Omni Cleaner, RAM Master, Smart Cooler, Total Cleaner, and AIO Flashlight. They had been installed more than 40 million times from the Google Play store prior to being removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google said this form of “click fraud” is rare and against its policies, which is why it blacklisted all six apps from its ad products. The company pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/ads/enabling-safe-digital-advertising-ecosystem/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; about action it took in 2018 against malicious ads and actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with committing ad fraud, the apps also concealed their connection to DU Group from users. In Google’s Play store, all of the above apps (except for AIO Flashlight) list their developer as “Pic Tools Group (Photo Editor&amp;amp; Photo Grid&amp;amp;Collage).” There are no references to DU Group, or Baidu, on the apps' descriptions within the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It provides a layer of obscurity for the user,” Hazum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s developer policy does not allow “apps or developer accounts that impersonate any person or organization, or that misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose ... or conceal their country of origin and that direct content at users in another country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the above apps, Selfie Camera raised the most concerns among researchers. In addition to the fake clicks documented by Check Point, Method Media Intelligence identified code in the app that could enable app attribution ad fraud. Praneet Sharma of MMI said, “There is a clear pattern of using certain packages that game install attribution and ad calls,” and warned of the “immense and dangerous amount of permissions” in this and other apps he examined. (Sharma did not see the app committing attribution ad fraud.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribution ad fraud, which BuzzFeed News &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/android-apps-cheetah-mobile-kika-kochava-ad-fraud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; was committed by Cheetah Mobile and Kika Tech, is used to falsely claim credit for app installations. Developers often pay a “bounty” to partners who help drive new installations of their products. In this case the selfie app from DU Group contained code enabling it to detect when someone downloaded a new app to their phone, and could be used to help claim any bounty on an offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ad fraud activity, the app also comes bundled with unrelated — and undisclosed — features, documented in user complaints on Play store reviews and an analysis by Eset, a security firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Completely false advertisement ... it has a bunch of hidden ‘performance enhancements’ for my phone that only screw it up more. I'll be reporting this as it needs to be in the description,” read a recent review from Duncan Mugume, a user in Uganda who told BuzzFeed News he downloaded the app after seeing an online ad for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in a Facebook message that after he installed the app it “behaved completely different” than expected, including running “scans” of his phone while it was not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukas Stefanko, a malware researcher with Eset, examined the app for BuzzFeed News and found it contains a wide range of functionality not revealed to the user in the Play store, including a hidden battery monitor, CPU cooler, and the ability to view external websites, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefanko said this extra functionality adds vulnerabilities because the app could be used to load malicious links. (He did not witness any such activity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One puzzling behavior by many of DU Group’s unbranded apps is that their privacy policies werere hosted on Tumblr blogs with strange names. Selfie Camera hosts its policy at &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/FulRs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dreamilyswimmingwizard.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt; while other apps have policies at &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/qhDy2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yesexactlyinnerbouquetstuff.tumblr.com/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/jIWqw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;superiorzzr.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These policies don’t reveal that the user’s data is being collected by DU Global, adding yet another layer of obfuscation. Kaltheuner, of Privacy International, told BuzzFeed News the policies are vague about how third parties, including potentially the Chinese government or other authorities, can gain access to the data being collected. She also said the policy for Selfie Camera incorrectly claims it does not collect personal data. Under GDPR, the European data legislation, a device ID is considered personal data, and Selfie Camera collects this from users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One DU Group app that is explicit about user data being sent to China is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meet.android&amp;amp;hl=es&amp;amp;source=freeapkdescaragr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meet&lt;/a&gt; chat app. Like others, it does not list DU Group anywhere on its Play store listing. But it says in its privacy policy that “it may require us to transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the European Economic Area ... including to countries such as the People’s Republic of China or Singapore.” (The researchers did not identify any ad fraud taking place in Meet.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DU Group did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashlight apps taking permissions, engaging in ad fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all Android phones ship with a built-in flashlight, making these apps largely unnecessary. Yet many third-party lights boast millions of installs, and have in the past been used as a Trojan horse to &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2016/06/24/new-godless-android-malware-running-rampant-over-850000-devices-affected/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deliver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://siliconangle.com/2018/01/05/millions-android-users-downloaded-malicious-flashlight-apps-google-play/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; or engage in ad fraud by loading ads in the background without a user’s knowledge. BuzzFeed News’ investigation identified multiple flashlight apps that requested a suspiciously high number of permissions from users, and/or were engaged in ad fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Flashlight app developers] took advantage of a window of opportunity when iPhones and Android devices did not have built-in flashlight functionality, so real humans downloaded flashlight apps that asked for insane permissions and few noticed since they just gave all permissions when installing,” Augustine Fou, an independent ad fraud researcher, told BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, the AIO Flashlight from DU Group was part of the group of apps fraudulently clicking on ads. It also took 31 permissions, seven of which are in the dangerous group. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emoji.flashlight&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emoji Flashlight&lt;/a&gt;, from APUS Apps of China, has over 5 million installs and took 30 permissions, of which seven are in the dangerous group — far more than are needed to function. How many permissions does a flashlight app actually need? &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humberto.flashlight&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This app&lt;/a&gt; in the Play store took just two permissions and does the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A request for comment sent to the email address listed on the Emoji Flashlight’s Play store page did not receive a reply. Emails to APUS Apps also went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A TV remote that says it might use your phone mic to record what you watch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the most invasive apps identified in the investigation belonged to Chinese companies, one American-made app stood out for its dragnet data collection policy and high number of permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peel.samsungtv'&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Samsung TV Remote Control&lt;/a&gt; app from Peel Technologies took 58 permissions, 23 of which are in the dangerous category defined by Android. The app is one of a family of TV remote applications from Peel that have similar functionality and permissions. They are all covered by a single privacy policy that says the app collects detailed information about the “content you consume (validated by audio content recognition).” This suggests the app accesses the microphone to record audio while you use it. It also collects information on your location, IP address, device, and behavior when you use the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an email response, Peel said its apps do not perform audio content recognition, but did not respond to a follow-up question about why that feature is cited in its privacy policy. It also said it only shares “Non-Personally Identifiable Location data for a fraction of our users” with third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may not be a household name, the company is a global player. It has claimed a registered user base of more than 130 million people and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/peel#section-funding-rounds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raised more than $86 million in venture capital&lt;/a&gt; funding. (Its most recent round of financing came in 2014 and was led by Chinese e-commerce and tech conglomerate Alibaba Group.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex xs-flex-column&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;subbuzz__attribution js-subbuzz__attribution xs-text-6 xs-block&quot;&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;91.745639534884&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason it has attracted so many users over its history is because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-10.1-has-arrived-game-changing-device-hits-u.s.-store-shelves-tomorrow'&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in 2012&lt;/a&gt; Peel signed a deal to preinstall its apps on some Samsung phones. (It had a similar deal with handset maker HTC.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Flynn, a management consultant in Brisbane, Australia, told BuzzFeed News that his Samsung Galaxy, purchased around 2015, came with a Peel remote app preinstalled. He recently became frustrated after the app kept taking over his screen with ads. The same happened to his mother-in-law, who also owns a Samsung Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That behavior was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wandera.com/mobile-security/mobile-malware/peel-tv-remote-adware/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documented earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; by mobile security firm Wandera, which called out the Peel remote for “misusing permissions functionality and aggressively advertising to its users.” Peel initially said its apps “do not do any advertisements at the moment.” However, BuzzFeed News found at least four of its apps were offering inventory for advertisers to buy across several ad networks. The company then said it’s running “minor experiments running to find the right balance between interstitial [ads] and user churn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn was so frustrated by the adds that he tried to delete the app from his phone. But it kept reappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When it came back, covering up our lock screens again, I was very frustrated,” he said. Flynn had to search online to find out how to disable the app and its many permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I've since gone through, revoked all permissions, disabled auto updates,” he said. “The whole experience has put me off Samsung altogether. It's still there, and that annoys me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But when it made life harder for an older lady who really struggles with technology, I was angry,” he said. “I've had an easier time removing viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He posted a review about his struggles in the Play store earlier this year to warn other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peel told BuzzFeed News its apps are no longer preinstalled on Samsung or HTC phones. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment, though the company continues to maintain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/disable-peel-remote/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an online help page&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to telling people how to disable the Peel TV remote app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A kids app sending personal data in the clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one kids app stood out among the apps that took unnecessary permissions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wawayaya.kids_iread.foreign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WaWaYaYa app&lt;/a&gt; is a reading app for kids that offers Chinese-language content. It also took 32 permissions, seven of which are from the dangerous group. Most alarmingly, analysis from Stefanko of Eset found the app is sending user information such as an email, username, real name, and information about their device back to servers in China without encryption or other protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is only available in Chinese and has only been installed 1,000 times from the Play store. The developer of the app did not reply to a request for comment. ●&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we found the apps and analyzed them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, BuzzFeed News collected information from the US Google Play store on the top 600 free, paid, and highest-grossing Android apps in four categories: &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/top&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/GAME&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/FAMILY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kids apps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/TOOLS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;. Some apps appeared in multiple lists (i.e., both top-grossing games and top-grossing overall); in total, BuzzFeed News identified 4,880 apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the data that can be gleaned from the Play store are each app’s permissions. BuzzFeed News cross-referenced those permissions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Android’s official documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which assigns certain permissions a “protection level” of “dangerous.” Such permissions tend to be those that provide access to sensitive information (text messages, body sensors, location, etc.) or those that have the ability to exert effects outside of the app (sending text messages, modifying contacts, creating voicemails, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuzzFeed News manually identified apps that requested a high number of permissions, including those assigned as “dangerous,” and began researching those that took more permissions than appeared to be required for them to function (such as flashlight apps). Apps that warranted technical examination were provided to Check Point, Method Media Intelligence, and Eset for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
