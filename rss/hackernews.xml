<title>An update to storage policies across your Google Account</title>
<link>https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-policy-update/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-policy-update/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Gmail, Google Drive and Google Photos have helped billions of people securely store and manage their emails, documents, photos, videos and more. Today, people are uploading more content than ever before—in fact, more than 4.3 million GB are added across Gmail, Drive and Photos every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue providing everyone with a great storage experience and to keep pace with the growing demand, we're announcing important upcoming storage changes to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://myaccount.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Account&lt;/a&gt;. These changes will apply to Photos and Drive (specifically Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms and Jamboard files) and will enable us to continue investing in these products for the future. We're also introducing new policies for consumer Google Accounts that are either inactive or over their storage limit across Gmail, Drive (including Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms and Jamboard files) and Photos, to bring our policies more in line with industry standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These storage policy changes won’t take effect until June 1, 2021. However, we wanted to let you know well in advance and give you the resources to navigate these changes. Google Workspace subscribers, and G Suite for Education and G Suite for Nonprofits customers should refer to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/11/changes-to-google-workspace-storage.html&quot;&gt;Google Workspace Updates post&lt;/a&gt; to understand how these changes may affect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, every Google Account will continue to come with 15 GB of free storage across Gmail, Drive and Photos, which we estimate should last the majority of our users several years.  Because the content you store with these apps is primarily personal, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/keeping-private-information-private/&quot;&gt;not used&lt;/a&gt; for advertising purposes. We’ll also continue to give you visibility and &lt;a href=&quot;https://one.google.com/storage/management?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=NME&amp;amp;utm_content=storage_manager&quot;&gt;control over your storage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://one.google.com/storage/management?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=iop&quot;&gt;provide tools&lt;/a&gt; to help you easily manage it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New content that will count toward your Google Account storage&lt;/h3&gt;
Beginning June 1, any &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; photo or video uploaded in &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791&quot;&gt;High quality&lt;/a&gt; in Google Photos will count toward your free 15 GB storage quota or any additional storage you’ve purchased as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://one.google.com&quot;&gt;Google One&lt;/a&gt; member. To make this transition easier, we’ll exempt all High quality photos and videos you back up before June 1. This includes all of the High quality photos and videos you currently store with Google Photos. Most people who back up in High quality should have years before they need to take action—in fact, we estimate that 80 percent of you should have at least three years before you reach 15 GB. You can learn more about this change in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/photos/storage-changes/&quot;&gt;Google Photos post&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>Justice Dept files suit against Facebook for discriminating against U.S. workers</title>
<link>https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-against-facebook-discriminating-against-us-workers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-against-facebook-discriminating-against-us-workers</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice announced today that it filed a lawsuit against Facebook Inc. for discriminating against U.S. workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleges that Facebook refused to recruit, consider, or hire qualified and available U.S. workers for over 2,600 positions that Facebook, instead, reserved for temporary visa holders it sponsored for permanent work authorization (or “green cards”) in connection with the permanent labor certification process (PERM). The positions that were the subject of Facebook’s alleged discrimination against U.S. workers offered an average salary of approximately $156,000. According to the lawsuit, and based on the department’s nearly two-year investigation, Facebook intentionally created a hiring system in which it denied qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to learn about and apply for jobs that Facebook instead sought to channel to temporary visa holders Facebook wanted to sponsor for green cards.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Department of Justice’s lawsuit alleges that Facebook engaged in intentional and widespread violations of the law, by setting aside positions for temporary visa holders instead of considering interested and qualified U.S. workers,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division. “This lawsuit follows a nearly two-year investigation into Facebook’s practices and a ‘reasonable cause’ determination by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. Our message to workers is clear: if companies deny employment opportunities by illegally preferring temporary visa holders, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable. Our message to all employers — including those in the technology sector — is clear: you cannot illegally prefer to recruit, consider, or hire temporary visa holders over U.S. workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department’s lawsuit alleges that beginning no later than Jan. 1, 2018 and lasting until at least Sept. 18, 2019, Facebook employed tactics that discriminated against U.S. workers and routinely preferred temporary visa holders (including H-1B visa holders) for jobs in connection with the PERM process. Rather than conducting a genuine search for qualified and available U.S. workers for permanent positions sought by these temporary visa holders, Facebook reserved the positions for temporary visa holders because of their immigration status, according to the complaint. The complaint also alleges that Facebook sought to channel jobs to temporary visa holders at the expense of U.S. workers by failing to advertise those vacancies on its careers website, requiring applicants to apply by physical mail only, and refusing to consider any U.S. workers who applied for those positions. In contrast, Facebook’s usual hiring process relies on recruitment methods designed to encourage applications by advertising positions on its careers website, accepting electronic applications, and not pre-selecting candidates to be hired based on a candidate’s immigration status, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its investigation, the department determined that Facebook’s ineffective recruitment methods dissuaded U.S. workers from applying to its PERM positions. The department concluded that, during the relevant period, Facebook received zero or one U.S. worker applicants for 99.7 percent of its PERM positions, while comparable positions at Facebook that were advertised on its careers website during a similar time period typically attracted 100 or more applicants each. These U.S. workers were denied an opportunity to be considered for the jobs Facebook sought to channel to temporary visa holders, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do Facebook’s alleged practices discriminate against U.S. workers, they have adverse consequences on temporary visa holders by creating an employment relationship that is not on equal terms. An employer that engages in the practices alleged in the lawsuit against Facebook can expect more temporary visa holders to apply for positions and increased retention post-hire. Such temporary visa holders often have limited job mobility and thus are likely to remain with their company until they can adjust status, which for some can be decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States’ complaint seeks civil penalties, back pay on behalf of U.S. workers denied employment at Facebook due to the alleged discrimination in favor of temporary visa holders, and other relief to ensure Facebook stops the alleged violations in the future. According to the lawsuit, and based on the department’s nearly two-year investigation, Facebook’s discrimination against U.S. workers was intentional, widespread, and in violation of a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1324b(a)(1), that the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division enforces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PERM process is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor and allows employers to offer permanent positions to temporary visa holders by converting them to lawful permanent residents who may live and work in the United States on a permanent basis. However, the PERM process requires an employer to first demonstrate that there are no qualified and available U.S. workers for the position that the employer plans to offer to the temporary visa holder. The INA protects U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, refugees, asylees, and recent lawful permanent residents from citizenship status discrimination in hiring, firing, and recruitment or referral for a fee. Workers who fall outside of these categories are not protected from citizenship status discrimination under the INA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lawsuit is filed as part of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division’s Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative, which was started in 2017 and is aimed at targeting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-fourth-settlement-protecting-us-workers-discrimination&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-fourth-settlement-protecting-us-workers-discrimination&quot;&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt;, and taking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-us-worker-discrimination-claims-against-colorado-agricultural&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-us-worker-discrimination-claims-against-colorado-agricultural&quot;&gt;enforcement actions&lt;/a&gt; against companies that discriminate against U.S. workers in favor of temporary visa holders. The Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) has reached numerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/houston-bus-company-distributes-more-90000-us-workers-under-department-justice-settlement&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/houston-bus-company-distributes-more-90000-us-workers-under-department-justice-settlement&quot;&gt;settlements&lt;/a&gt; under the Initiative, and employers have distributed or agreed to pay a combined total of more than $1.2 million in back pay to affected U.S. workers and civil penalties to the United States.  These &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claims-against-landscaping-company-discriminating-against-us&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claims-against-landscaping-company-discriminating-against-us&quot;&gt;settlements&lt;/a&gt; involve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claim-against-florida-strawberry-farm-discriminating-against-us&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claim-against-florida-strawberry-farm-discriminating-against-us&quot;&gt;employers&lt;/a&gt; that discriminated in their use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claims-against-international-financial-association-discriminating&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claims-against-international-financial-association-discriminating&quot;&gt;H-1B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-us-worker-discrimination-claims-against-new-mexico-farm&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-us-worker-discrimination-claims-against-new-mexico-farm&quot;&gt;H-2A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claim-against-maryland-construction-firm-discriminating-against-us&quot; title=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claim-against-maryland-construction-firm-discriminating-against-us&quot;&gt;H-2B&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-settles-claim-against-california-based-staffing-company-favoring-temporary&quot;&gt;F-1&lt;/a&gt; visas.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Warner Bros. Will Send Entire 2021 Slate to HBO Max and Theaters</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;28.6875&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;js-publish-date article__publish-date&quot; data-pubdate-value=&quot;2020120310&quot;&gt;10:30 AM PST 12/3/2020&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;span class=&quot;js-authors-list&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Aaron Couch&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Pamela McClintock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;117.08609271523&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;article__deck&quot;&gt;In an unprecedented announcement, the studio will send 17 films — including 'The Matrix 4,' 'The Suicide Squad' and 'Dune' to its streaming service for 31 days the same day they hit theaters.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner Bros. is plotting a sweeping response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has shuttered movie theaters around the country. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/wonder-woman-1984-heading-to-hbo-max-theaters-dec-25&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; will go to HBO Max as well as theaters on Dec. 25, the studio has laid out a similar path for its 2021 slate amid uncertainty about when movie-going will get back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studio announced Thursday day-and-date releases for its 17-film slate, which will hit HBO Max for a one-month window that starts the same day they will be available in U.S. theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studio's 2021 slate includes projects such as &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/keanu-reeves-calls-matrix-4-a-beautiful-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dune-unveils-ambitious-first-trailer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lebron-james-unveils-space-jam-a-new-legacy-title-logo-1292743&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Other films include &lt;em&gt;Little Things&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Judas and the Black Messiah&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tom-jerry-live-action-animated-hybrid-film-drops-first-trailer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom &amp;amp; Jerry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Those Who Wish Me Dead, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/heights-trailer-lin-manuel-miranda-broadway-musical-movie-1261923&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;In The Heights&lt;/a&gt;, Reminiscence, Malignant, The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;King Richard &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Cry Macho.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented move is likely to catch theater owners off guard and upsets a model that has been in place for decades. Warner Bros. stresses that these are pandemic-only rules, but once a something is broken, can you really put it back together again? This also raises serious concerns about the landscape of movie-going in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources say these discussions were kept close to the vest and not shared with many exhibitors. Warner Bros. will likely have to agree to far more generous terms with theater owners to avoid them boycotting their films. Insiders say the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/wonder-woman-1984-trailer-brings-back-gal-gadots-warrior-1260653&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; split of ticket sales is far better for exhibitors than normal. Sources also say the studio did not inform partners such as Legendary, which has &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, that their films were included in this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re living in unprecedented times which call for creative solutions, including this new initiative for the Warner Bros. Pictures Group,” said Ann Sarnoff, chair and CEO, WarnerMedia Studios and Networks Group “No one wants films back on the big screen more than we do. We know new content is the lifeblood of theatrical exhibition, but we have to balance this with the reality that most theaters in the U.S. will likely operate at reduced capacity throughout 2021. With this unique one-year plan, we can support our partners in exhibition with a steady pipeline of world-class films, while also giving moviegoers who may not have access to theaters or aren’t quite ready to go back to the movies the chance to see our amazing 2021 films. We see it as a win-win for film lovers and exhibitors, and we’re extremely grateful to our filmmaking partners for working with us on this innovative response to these circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After considering all available options and the projected state of moviegoing throughout 2021, we came to the conclusion that this was the best way for WarnerMedia’s motion picture business to navigate the next 12 months,” said WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar. “More importantly, we are planning to bring consumers 17 remarkable movies throughout the year, giving them the choice and the power to decide how they want to enjoy these films. Our content is extremely valuable, unless it’s sitting on a shelf not being seen by anyone. We believe this approach serves our fans, supports exhibitors and filmmakers, and enhances the HBO Max experience, creating value for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This hybrid exhibition model enables us to best support our films, creative partners and moviegoing in general throughout 2021,” said Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich. “We have a fantastic, wide-ranging slate of titles from talented and visionary filmmakers next year, and we’re excited to be able get these movies in front of audiences around the world. And, as always, we’ll support all of our releases with innovative and robust marketing campaigns for their theatrical debuts, while highlighting this unique opportunity to see our films domestically via HBO Max as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HBO Max is only available in the United States, and Warners' 2021 slate will roll out internationally in theaters as planned.  The move comes after Warners released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tenet-film-review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Christopher Nolan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;in theaters this summer amid challenges faced by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal has already shortened theatrical windows via its unique VOD plan, which was put in place because of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is free for all to read thanks to the investment &lt;strong&gt;Platformer&lt;/strong&gt; subscribers have made in independent journalism. If this work is meaningful to you, I invite you to become a subscriber today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, a prominent a co-leader of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence team at Google sent an email to her colleagues. Timnit Gebru had been working on a research paper that she hoped to publish, but ran into resistance from her superiors at Google. And so she sent a letter expressing her frustration to the internal listserv Google Brain Women and Allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Gebru was fired — Google reportedly found the email “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” It details the struggles Gebru experienced as a Black leader working on ethics research within the company, and presents a bleak view of the path forward for underrepresented minorities at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gebru is well known and respected in the AI ethics community; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email?sref=ExbtjcSG&quot;&gt;here are Shelly Banjo and Mark Bergen on her background at Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16.299236641221&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gebru, an alumni of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is one of the leading voices in the ethical use of artificial intelligence. She is well-known for her work on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212&quot; title=&quot;MIT&quot;&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that showed how facial recognition software misidentified dark-skinned women as much as 35% of the time, whereas the technology worked with near precision on white men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has also been an outspoken critic of the lack of diversity and unequal treatment of Black workers at tech companies, particularly at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Alphabet Inc.&lt;/a&gt;’s Google, and said she believed her dismissal was meant to send a message to the rest of Google’s employees not to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platformer received the email Gebru sent; she herself did not have access to her account after Google terminated her. It is published in full below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But on Thursday morning, Jeff Dean, the head of Google research, emailed employees with his account of what happened. Dean said Gebru had issued ultimatum and would resign unless certain conditions were met. &lt;strong&gt;Platformer&lt;/strong&gt; obtained Dean’s email as well; you can find it below Gebru’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;79&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR &amp;amp; Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR &amp;amp; Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timnit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the email that Jeff Dean sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.  Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical DEI programs. &lt;strong&gt;Please don’t&lt;/strong&gt;. I understand the frustration about the pace of progress, but we have important work ahead and we need to keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we all genuinely share Timnit’s passion to make AI more equitable and inclusive. No doubt, wherever she goes after Google, she’ll do great work and I look forward to reading her papers and seeing what she accomplishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and for all the important work you continue to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Jeff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Colombia is considering legalizing its cocaine industry</title>
<link>https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdv3j/colombia-is-considering-legalizing-its-massive-cocaine-industry</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdv3j/colombia-is-considering-legalizing-its-massive-cocaine-industry</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;MEDELLÍN, Colombia - VICE World News sat down with Senator Iván Marulanda to talk about his cocaine legalization bill, which is currently moving through Colombia’s congress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;After 40 years of U.S. - backed anti-drug policy that criminalizes the coca leaf, Marulanda and a group of members of congress want to change tack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The bill attempts to create a legal industry that distributes cocaine to users for pain relief, not recreational use. Like that in Bolivia, it also hopes to bring hundreds of thousands of illegal coca farmers out of the shadows into a legal, homegrown industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VICE World News: So what does your bill propose exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Senator Iván Marulanda: It proposes that the state buy the entirety of Colombia’s coca harvest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;There are 200,000 farmer families linked to coca growing. The state would buy coca at market prices. The programs for coca eradication each year cost four trillion pesos ($1 billion). Buying the entire coca harvest each year would cost 2.6 trillion pesos ($680 million). It costs less to buy the harvest than to destroy it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;With that intervention from the government, two fundamental things would happen. First, you would bring 200,000 families into a legal sphere where they would no longer be persecuted by the state. Usually, these farm families end up displacing themselves, deforesting new areas, and re-planting coca while they’re running from the authorities. Second, Colombia is destroying around 300,000 hectares of forest per year. It’s estimated that coca-growing families are responsible for 25 percent of that annual deforestation. Colombia’s ecosystems are the collateral damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would the government do with all the coca leaves?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The state would supply raw materials to artisanal industries - primarily of indigenous origin - that would produce foods, baking flour, medicinal products and drinks like tea. Those ancestral industries in Colombia haven’t had the chance to develop because the raw material is stigmatized and persecuted by the justice authorities. So, on one hand, it’s about developing these industries. Indigenous groups have a strong relationship with the leaf because they’ve taken care of it for hundreds of years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Now, the coca leaf has other properties too. Studies show it has a significant amount of calcium. There are nutritional properties. And so there are opportunities to open up to industrial production. There are also ways to make fertilizers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The other thing the state would do is produce cocaine. It would supply that cocaine to users. And then it would supply coca and cocaine to research groups around the world who could study it for analgesic (pain-killing) uses. It hasn’t been easy to do that because it hasn’t been easy for these research groups to obtain cocaine. So, this would mean companies would enter into contracts with pharmaceutical companies with state-of-the-art research and top security protocols to buy it in pure form from the state. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In Colombia, the personal consumption of cocaine is legal. It’s legal because of a court ruling that recognizes personal consumption as a human right. In Colombia we have those freedoms and the state can’t intervene. However, what we don’t have is the legal cocaine to meet that demand. Instead, we have consumers who are in contact with organized crime groups who supply them cocaine in local drug markets. It’s poor quality cocaine and it’s often mixed with unregulated substances. It’s everywhere: in our schools, in universities, in parks and bars. It’s in all these public spaces. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;So this policy would mean cutting organized crime off from the coca leaf, and it would cut consumers off from organized crime. The Colombian state would distribute it to users under a public health program, effectively through physicians who would evaluate if a person is apt for taking cocaine for their pain. Do they have the right physical and mental conditions? That’s the question we would have to ask. And then it would be high-quality cocaine. Another important thing here is that not all consumers are addicts. Less than 10 percent of cocaine consumers are addicts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How successful has Colombia’s war on drugs been?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Colombia has a military and police-driven drug policy that dates back to the 1980s, when drug-trafficking was the powerful weapon of the cartels. Colombia’s first reaction - and also the response of the international community - was to start a war on drugs. The war on drugs is a law-and-order policy against drugs that thinks of drugs as a criminal offence. It’s also a persecution against the coca plant, the leaves of which are used to produce cocaine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;That policy has not changed since the 1980s. Actually, Colombia’s drug policy has only become more entrenched, more stubborn and more severe in its application. We’re now in the year 2020. Yet Colombia exports 90 percent of the cocaine in the world today. There are about 1,500 tonnes that leave the country each year. And there are about 200,000 hectares of land under cultivation of coca. We’re inundated with cocaine and inundated with deaths and violence. We’ve lost sovereignty over Colombian territory to the dominion of organized criminal mafias.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Over this period of 40 years, Colombia’s anti-drug policy has become almost like a religion for two generations. Two generations that were born and raised with this way of thinking about drugs. But this policy is now part of our culture and dogma. Yet in 40 years, we haven’t had a real, honest conversation about this policy and its results. It’s a policy that’s been reinforced by the international community and above all the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you decouple the cocaine trade from criminal organizations?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;You have to remember the state has a large margin here. The state is spending $1 billion on eradication. Buying coca leaves would cost the state $680 million. There’s a strong fiscal margin and they could push up the price if they need to. And if you need more, you’d have to feed the program with more public spending. But the important thing here is to save lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The thing is, we have to recover control over the state. We’re losing control of the state to corruption, narcos in politics. They’re in municipalities, in departments and in congress. All the way to the highest echelons of government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think the U.S. would think about a legal cocaine trade in Colombia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The U.S. has been an important partner for Colombia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;We’ve been going 40 years with a policy that costs billions of U.S. dollars with zero success and so much cost and destruction. Let’s try out this other policy. Because something that hasn’t worked in the last 40 years is something that’s just not going to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The United States is just like Colombia. We’re throwing away enormous quantities of money on the war on drugs in the garbage, instead of dedicating it to social and human development in order to improve peoples’ well being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The scenario for relations between Colombia and the United States will be very different [under President-elect] Biden. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Colombia have the right to do what it wants with cocaine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;This is the thing. Anti-drug policy doesn’t have the same effect for a country like the United States or a European country as it does for Colombia. We’re the producers. That means this is destroying the lives of our youth, of our soldiers and police. The economy is totally disfigured because of this business. And look at the problems of corruption. It’s brutal. Our current anti-policy is destroying Colombia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;There are countries in solidarity with Colombia on this issue. Colombia has all the right in the world to look for an exit from this problem. But I don’t rule out the possibility that other countries want to implement a public health policy that would supply cocaine from the state to their consumers. They would buy from the Colombian state and distribute. And it would be distributed outside of the blackmarket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest obstacles and threats to this bill?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;The first big obstacle is to open up the conversation among public opinion. This has been a giant taboo. Colombians are born and raised under this assumption that drug-trafficking is a war. There’s no information about coca and cocaine. So, with this bill we hope to open the conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;Right now, there are a lot of parties that hold power right now, and they’ve gained that power by selling the war on drugs. It’s their political flag and it’s won them lots of votes. Those parties - the ruling party Centro Democratico, the Conservative party, Cambio Radical - this has always been their traditional policy stance: to fight cocaine as a crime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;abc__textblock size--article&quot; data-component=&quot;TextBlock&quot;&gt;In our upcoming presidential elections in 2022, I hope that candidates get asked by the public: ‘What do you think about the legalization of cocaine?” Because that’s never happened before in Colombia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Computer input latency from 1977-2017 (2017)</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Computer latency: 1977-2017&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:;base64,=&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;458.86537051904&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer latency: 1977-2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've had this nagging feeling that the computers I use today feel slower than the computers I used as a kid. As a rule, I don’t trust this kind of feeling because human perception has been shown to be unreliable in empirical studies, so I carried around a high-speed camera and measured the response latency of devices I’ve run into in the past few months. Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are tests of the latency between a keypress and the display of a character in a terminal (see appendix for more details). The results are sorted from quickest to slowest. In the latency column, the background goes from green to yellow to red to black as devices get slower and the background gets darker as devices get slower. No devices are green. When multiple OSes were tested on the same machine, the os is &lt;strong&gt;in bold&lt;/strong&gt;. When multiple refresh rates were tested on the same machine, the refresh rate is &lt;em&gt;in italics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the year column, the background gets darker and purple-er as devices get older. If older devices were slower, we’d see the year column get darker as we read down the chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two columns show the clock speed and number of transistors in the processor. Smaller numbers are darker and blue-er. As above, if slower clocked and smaller chips correlated with longer latency, the columns would get darker as we go down the table, but it, if anything, seems to be the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, the latency of a packet going around the world through fiber from NYC back to NYC via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/122989-1-5-billion-the-cost-of-cutting-london-toyko-latency-by-60ms&quot;&gt;Tokyo and London&lt;/a&gt; is inserted in the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at overall results, the fastest machines are ancient. Newer machines are all over the place. Fancy gaming rigs with unusually high refresh-rate displays are almost competitive with machines from the late 70s and early 80s, but “normal” modern computers can’t compete with thirty to forty year old machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also look at mobile devices. In this case, we’ll look at scroll latency in the browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As above, the results are sorted by latency and color-coded from green to yellow to red to black as devices get slower. Also as above, the year gets purple-er (and darker) as the device gets older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we exclude the &lt;code&gt;game boy color&lt;/code&gt;, which is a different class of device than the rest, all of the quickest devices are Apple phones or tablets. The next quickest device is the &lt;code&gt;blackberry q10&lt;/code&gt;. Although we don’t have enough data to really tell why the &lt;code&gt;blackberry q10&lt;/code&gt; is unusually quick for a non-Apple device, one plausible guess is that it’s helped by having actual buttons, which are easier to implement with low latency than a touchscreen. The other two devices with actual buttons are the &lt;code&gt;gameboy color&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;kindle 4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that &lt;code&gt;iphones&lt;/code&gt; and non-kindle button devices, we have a variety of Android devices of various ages. At the bottom, we have the ancient &lt;code&gt;palm pilot 1000&lt;/code&gt; followed by the kindles. The &lt;code&gt;palm&lt;/code&gt; is hamstrung by a touchscreen and display created in an era with much slower touchscreen technology and the &lt;code&gt;kindles&lt;/code&gt; use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Ink&quot;&gt;e-ink&lt;/a&gt; displays, which are much slower than the displays used on modern phones, so it’s not surprising to see those devices at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-the-apple-2e-so-fast&quot;&gt;Why is the &lt;code&gt;apple 2e&lt;/code&gt; so fast?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to a modern computer that’s not the latest &lt;code&gt;ipad pro&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;apple 2&lt;/code&gt; has significant advantages on both the input and the output, and it also has an advantage between the input and the output for all but the most carefully written code since the &lt;code&gt;apple 2&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t have to deal with context switches, buffers involved in handoffs between different processes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the input, if we look at modern keyboards, it’s common to see them scan their inputs at &lt;code&gt;100 Hz&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;200 Hz&lt;/code&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware&quot;&gt;the ergodox claims to scan at &lt;code&gt;167 Hz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). By comparison, the &lt;code&gt;apple 2e&lt;/code&gt; effectively scans at &lt;code&gt;556 Hz&lt;/code&gt;. See appendix for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the other end of the pipeline, the display, we can also find latency bloat there. I have a display that advertises &lt;code&gt;1 ms&lt;/code&gt; switching on the box, but if we look at how long it takes for the display to actually show a character from when you can first see the trace of it on the screen until the character is solid, it can easily be &lt;code&gt;10 ms&lt;/code&gt;. You can even see this effect with some high-refresh-rate displays that are sold on their allegedly good latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;code&gt;144 Hz&lt;/code&gt;, each frame takes &lt;code&gt;7 ms&lt;/code&gt;. A change to the screen will have &lt;code&gt;0 ms&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;7 ms&lt;/code&gt; of extra latency as it waits for the next frame boundary before getting rendered (on average,we expect half of the maximum latency, or &lt;code&gt;3.5 ms&lt;/code&gt;). On top of that, even though my display at home advertises a &lt;code&gt;1 ms&lt;/code&gt; switching time, it actually appears to take &lt;code&gt;10 ms&lt;/code&gt; to fully change color once the display has started changing color. When we add up the latency from waiting for the next frame to the latency of an actual color change, we get an expected latency of &lt;code&gt;7/2 + 10 = 13.5ms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the old CRT in the &lt;code&gt;apple 2e&lt;/code&gt;, we’d expect half of a &lt;code&gt;60 Hz&lt;/code&gt; refresh (&lt;code&gt;16.7 ms / 2&lt;/code&gt;) plus a negligible delay, or &lt;code&gt;8.3 ms&lt;/code&gt;. That’s hard to beat today: a state of the art “gaming monitor” can get the total display latency down into the same range, but in terms of marketshare, very few people have such displays, and even displays that are advertised as being fast aren’t always actually fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ios-rendering-pipeline&quot;&gt;iOS rendering pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at what’s happening between the input and the output, the differences between a modern system and an &lt;code&gt;apple 2e&lt;/code&gt; are too many to describe without writing an entire book. To get a sense of the situation in modern machines, here’s former iOS/UIKit engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://andymatuschak.org/&quot;&gt;Andy Matuschak&lt;/a&gt;’s high-level sketch of what happens on iOS, which he says should be presented with the disclaimer that “this is my out of date memory of out of date information”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;hardware has its own scanrate (e.g. &lt;code&gt;120 Hz&lt;/code&gt; for recent touch panels), so that can introduce up to &lt;code&gt;8 ms&lt;/code&gt; latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;events are delivered to the kernel through firmware; this is relatively quick but system scheduling concerns may introduce a couple &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt; here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the kernel delivers those events to privileged subscribers (here, &lt;code&gt;backboardd&lt;/code&gt;) over a mach port; more scheduling loss possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;backboardd&lt;/code&gt; must determine which process should receive the event; this requires taking a lock against the window server, which shares that information (a trip back into the kernel, more scheduling delay)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;backboardd&lt;/code&gt; sends that event to the process in question; more scheduling delay possible before it is processed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those events are only dequeued on the main thread; something else may be happening on the main thread (e.g. as result of a timer or network activity), so some more latency may result, depending on that work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UIKit introduced &lt;code&gt;1-2 ms&lt;/code&gt; event processing overhead, CPU-bound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;application decides what to do with the event; apps are poorly written, so usually this takes many &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;. the consequences are batched up in a data-driven update which is sent to the render server over IPC
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the app needs a new shared-memory video buffer as a consequence of the event, which will happen anytime something non-trivial is happening, that will require round-trip IPC to the render server; more scheduling delays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(trivial changes are things which the render server can incorporate itself, like affine transformation changes or color changes to layers; non-trivial changes include anything that has to do with text, most raster and vector operations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These kinds of updates often end up being triple-buffered: the GPU might be using one buffer to render right now; the render server might have another buffer queued up for its next frame; and you want to draw into another. More (cross-process) locking here; more trips into kernel-land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the render server applies those updates to its render tree (a few &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every &lt;code&gt;N Hz&lt;/code&gt;, the render tree is flushed to the GPU, which is asked to fill a video buffer
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Actually, though, there’s often triple-buffering for the screen buffer, for the same reason I described above: the GPU’s drawing into one now; another might be being read from in preparation for another frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every &lt;code&gt;N Hz&lt;/code&gt;, that video buffer is swapped with another video buffer, and the display is driven directly from that memory
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(this &lt;code&gt;N Hz&lt;/code&gt; isn’t necessarily ideally aligned with the preceding step’s &lt;code&gt;N Hz&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy says “the actual amount of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; happening here is typically quite small. A few &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt; of CPU time. Key overhead comes from:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;periodic scanrates (input device, render server, display) imperfectly aligned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many handoffs across process boundaries, each an opportunity for something else to get scheduled instead of the consequences of the input event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of locking, especially across process boundaries, necessitating trips into kernel-land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, on the Apple 2e, there basically aren’t handoffs, locks, or process boundaries. Some very simple code runs and writes the result to the display memory, which causes the display to get updated on the next scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;refresh-rate-vs-latency&quot;&gt;Refresh rate vs. latency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s curious about the computer results is the impact of refresh rate. We get a &lt;code&gt;90 ms&lt;/code&gt; improvement from going from &lt;code&gt;24 Hz&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;165 Hz&lt;/code&gt;. At &lt;code&gt;24 Hz&lt;/code&gt; each frame takes &lt;code&gt;41.67 ms&lt;/code&gt; and at &lt;code&gt;165 Hz&lt;/code&gt; each frame takes &lt;code&gt;6.061 ms&lt;/code&gt;. As we saw above, if there weren’t any buffering, we’d expect the average latency added by frame refreshes to be &lt;code&gt;20.8ms&lt;/code&gt; in the former case and &lt;code&gt;3.03 ms&lt;/code&gt; in the latter case (because we’d expect to arrive at a uniform random point in the frame and have to wait between &lt;code&gt;0ms&lt;/code&gt; and the full frame time), which is a difference of about &lt;code&gt;18ms&lt;/code&gt;. But the difference is actually &lt;code&gt;90 ms&lt;/code&gt;, implying we have latency equivalent to &lt;code&gt;(90 - 18) / (41.67 - 6.061) = 2&lt;/code&gt; buffered frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we plot the results from the other refresh rates on the same machine (not shown), we can see that they’re roughly in line with a “best fit” curve that we get if we assume that, for that machine running powershell, we get 2.5 frames worth of latency regardless of refresh rate. This lets us estimate what the latency would be if we equipped this low latency gaming machine with an &lt;code&gt;infinity Hz&lt;/code&gt; display -- we’d expect latency to be &lt;code&gt;140 - 2.5 * 41.67 = 36 ms&lt;/code&gt;, almost as fast as quick but standard machines from the 70s and 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every computer and mobile device that people buy today is slower than common models of computers from the 70s and 80s. Low-latency gaming desktops and the &lt;code&gt;ipad pro&lt;/code&gt; can get into the same range as quick machines from thirty to forty years ago, but most off-the-shelf devices aren’t even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we had to pick one root cause of latency bloat, we might say that it’s because of “complexity”. Of course, we all know that complexity is bad. If you’ve been to a non-academic non-enterprise tech conference in the past decade, there’s a good chance that there was at least one talk on how complexity is the root of all evil and we should aspire to reduce complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's a lot harder to remove complexity than to give a talk saying that we should remove complexity. A lot of the complexity buys us something, either directly or indirectly. When we looked at the input of a fancy modern keyboard vs. the &lt;code&gt;apple 2&lt;/code&gt; keyboard, we saw that using a relatively powerful and expensive general purpose processor to handle keyboard inputs can be slower than dedicated logic for the keyboard, which would both be simpler and cheaper. However, using the processor gives people the ability to easily customize the keyboard, and also pushes the problem of “programming” the keyboard from hardware into software, which reduces the cost of making the keyboard. The more expensive chip increases the manufacturing cost, but considering how much of the cost of these small-batch artisanal keyboards is the design cost, it seems like a net win to trade manufacturing cost for ease of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this kind of tradeoff in every part of the pipeline. One of the biggest examples of this is the OS you might run on a modern desktop vs. the loop that’s running on the &lt;code&gt;apple 2&lt;/code&gt;. Modern OSes let programmers write generic code that can deal with having other programs simultaneously running on the same machine, and do so with pretty reasonable general performance, but we pay a huge complexity cost for this and the handoffs involved in making this easy result in a significant latency penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the complexity might be called &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.c2.com/?AccidentalComplexity&quot;&gt;accidental complexity&lt;/a&gt;, but most of that accidental complexity is there because it’s so convenient. At every level from the hardware architecture to the syscall interface to the I/O framework we use, we take on complexity, much of which could be eliminated if we could sit down and re-write all of the systems and their interfaces today, but it’s too inconvenient to re-invent the universe to reduce complexity and we get benefits from economies of scale, so we live with what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those reasons and more, in practice, the solution to poor performance caused by “excess” complexity is often to add more complexity. In particular, the gains we’ve seen that get us back to the quickness of the quickest machines from thirty to forty years ago have come not from listening to exhortations to reduce complexity, but from piling on more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ipad pro&lt;/code&gt; is a feat of modern engineering; the engineering that went into increasing the refresh rate on both the input and the output as well as making sure the software pipeline doesn’t have unnecessary buffering is complex! The design and manufacture of high-refresh-rate displays that can push system latency down is also non-trivially complex in ways that aren’t necessary for bog standard &lt;code&gt;60 Hz&lt;/code&gt; displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a common theme when working on latency reduction. A common trick to reduce latency is to add a cache, but adding a cache to a system makes it more complex. For systems that generate new data and can’t tolerate a cache, the solutions are often even more complex. An example of this might be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDMA_over_Converged_Ethernet&quot;&gt;large scale RoCE deployments&lt;/a&gt;. These can push remote data access latency from from the millisecond range down to the microsecond range, &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/infinite-disk/&quot;&gt;which enables new classes of applications&lt;/a&gt;. However, this has come at a large cost in complexity. Early large-scale RoCE deployments easily took tens of person years of effort to get right and also came with a tremendous operational burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit absurd that a modern gaming machine running at &lt;code&gt;4,000x&lt;/code&gt; the speed of an &lt;code&gt;apple 2&lt;/code&gt;, with a CPU that has &lt;code&gt;500,000x&lt;/code&gt; as many transistors (with a GPU that has &lt;code&gt;2,000,000x&lt;/code&gt; as many transistors) can maybe manage the same latency as an &lt;code&gt;apple 2&lt;/code&gt; in very carefully coded applications if we have a monitor with nearly &lt;code&gt;3x&lt;/code&gt; the refresh rate. It’s perhaps even more absurd that the default configuration of the &lt;code&gt;powerspec g405&lt;/code&gt;, which had the fastest single-threaded performance you could get until October 2017, had more latency from keyboard-to-screen (approximately &lt;code&gt;3 feet&lt;/code&gt;, maybe &lt;code&gt;10 feet&lt;/code&gt; of actual cabling) than sending a packet around the world (&lt;code&gt;16187 mi&lt;/code&gt; from NYC to Tokyo to London back to NYC, more due to the cost of running the shortest possible length of fiber).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, we’re arguably emerging from the latency dark ages and it’s now possible to assemble a computer or buy a tablet with latency that’s in the same range as you could get off-the-shelf in the 70s and 80s. This reminds me a bit of the screen resolution &amp;amp; density dark ages, where CRTs from the 90s offered better resolution and higher pixel density than affordable non-laptop LCDs until relatively recently. 4k displays have now become normal and affordable 8k displays are on the horizon, blowing past anything we saw on consumer CRTs. I don’t know that we’ll see the same kind improvement with respect to latency, but one can hope. There are individual developers improving the experience for people who use certain, very carefully coded, applications, but it's not clear what force could cause a significant improvement in the default experience most users see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-why-measure-latency&quot;&gt;Appendix: why measure latency?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latency matters! For very simple tasks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/386a/15fd85c162b8e4ebb6023acdce9df2bd43ee.pdf&quot;&gt;people can perceive latencies down to &lt;code&gt;2 ms&lt;/code&gt; or less&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, increasing latency is not only noticeable to users, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tactuallabs.com/papers/howMuchFasterIsFastEnoughCHI15.pdf&quot;&gt;it causes users to execute simple tasks less accurately&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a visual demonstration of what latency looks like and you don’t have a super-fast old computer lying around, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4&quot;&gt;check out this MSR demo on touchscreen latency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly cited document on response time is the nielsen group article on response times, which claims that latncies below &lt;code&gt;100ms&lt;/code&gt; feel equivalent and perceived as instantaneous. One easy way to see that this is false is to go into your terminal and try &lt;code&gt;sleep 0; echo &quot;pong&quot;&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;sleep 0.1; echo &quot;test&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (or for that matter, try playing an old game that doesn't have latency compensation, like quake 1, with &lt;code&gt;100 ms&lt;/code&gt; ping, or even &lt;code&gt;30 ms&lt;/code&gt; ping, or try typing in a terminal with &lt;code&gt;30 ms&lt;/code&gt; ping). For more info on this and other latency fallacies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/#appendix-counter-arguments-to-common-arguments-that-latency-doesn-t-matter&quot;&gt;see this document on common misconceptions about latency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/39187441/334816&quot;&gt;Throughput&lt;/a&gt; also matters, but this is widely understood and measured. If you go to pretty much any mainstream review or benchmarking site, you can find a wide variety of throughput measurements, so there’s less value in writing up additional throughput measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-apple-2-keyboard&quot;&gt;Appendix: apple 2 keyboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;apple 2e&lt;/code&gt;, instead of using a programmed microcontroller to read the keyboard, uses a much simpler custom chip designed for reading keyboard input, the AY 3600. If we look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/AY3600.pdf&quot;&gt;the AY 3600 datasheet&lt;/a&gt;,we can see that the scan time is &lt;code&gt;(90 * 1/f)&lt;/code&gt; and the debounce time is listed as &lt;code&gt;strobe_delay&lt;/code&gt;. These quantities are determined by some capacitors and a resistor, which appear to be &lt;code&gt;47pf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;100k ohms&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;0.022uf&lt;/code&gt; for the Apple 2e. Plugging these numbers into &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/AY3600.pdf&quot;&gt;the AY3600 datasheet&lt;/a&gt;, we can see that &lt;code&gt;f = 50 kHz&lt;/code&gt;, giving us a &lt;code&gt;1.8 ms&lt;/code&gt; scan delay and a &lt;code&gt;6.8 ms&lt;/code&gt; debounce delay (assuming the values are accurate -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/191/Why%2047%20uF%20capacitor%20drops%20to%2037%20uF-%2030%20uF-%20or%20lower.pdf&quot;&gt;capacitors can degrade over time&lt;/a&gt;, so we should expect the real delays to be shorter on our old Apple 2e), giving us less than &lt;code&gt;8.6 ms&lt;/code&gt; for the internal keyboard logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing to a keyboard with a &lt;code&gt;167 Hz&lt;/code&gt; scan rate that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce&quot;&gt;scans two extra times to debounce&lt;/a&gt;, the equivalent figure is &lt;code&gt;3 * 6 ms = 18 ms&lt;/code&gt;. With a &lt;code&gt;100Hz&lt;/code&gt; scan rate, that becomes &lt;code&gt;3 * 10 ms = 30 ms&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;18 ms&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;30 ms&lt;/code&gt; of keyboard scan plus debounce latency is in line with &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/&quot;&gt;what we saw when we did some preliminary keyboard latency measurements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, the ergodox uses a &lt;code&gt;16 MHz&lt;/code&gt; microcontroller with ~80k transistors and the &lt;code&gt;apple 2e&lt;/code&gt; CPU is a &lt;code&gt;1 MHz&lt;/code&gt; chip with 3.5k transistors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-why-should-android-phones-have-higher-latency-than-old-apple-phones&quot;&gt;Appendix: why should android phones have higher latency than old apple phones?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've seen, raw processing power doesn't help much with many of the causes of latency in the pipeline, like handoffs between different processes, so phones that an android phone with a 10x more powerful processor than an ancient iphone isn't guaranteed to be quicker to respond, even if it can render javascript heavy pages faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you talk to people who work on non-Apple mobile CPUs, you'll find that they run benchmarks like dhrystone (a synthetic benchmark that was irrelevant even when it was created, in 1984) and SPEC2006 (an updated version of a workstation benchmark that was relevant in the 90s and perhaps even as late as the early 2000s if you care about workstation workloads, which are completely different from mobile workloads). This problem where the vendor who makes the component has &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/percentile-latency/&quot;&gt;an intermediate target&lt;/a&gt; that's only weakly correlated to the actual user experience. I've heard that there are people working on the pixel phones who care about end-to-end latency, but it's difficult to get good latency when you have to use components that are optimized for things like dhrystone and SPEC2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you talk to people at Apple, you'll find that they're quite cagey, but that they've been targeting the end-to-end user experience for quite a long time and they they can do &quot;full stack&quot; optimizations that are difficult for android vendors to pull of. They're not literally impossible, but making a change to a chip that has to be threaded up through the OS is something you're very unlikely to see unless google is doing the optimization, and google hasn't really been serious about the end-to-end experience until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having relatively poor performance in aspects that aren't measured is a common theme and one we saw when we looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/term-latency/&quot;&gt;terminal latency&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to examining temrinal latency, public benchmarks were all throughput oriented and the terminals that priortized performance worked on increasing throughput, even though increasing terminal throughput isn't really useful. After those terminal latency benchmarks, some terminal authors looked into their latency and found places they could trim down buffering and remove latency. You get what you measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-experimental-setup&quot;&gt;Appendix: experimental setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most measurements were taken with the 240fps camera (&lt;code&gt;4.167 ms&lt;/code&gt; resolution) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071W3DDM7/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071W3DDM7&amp;amp;linkId=fde44f1346bdf4bc60896580c2f3dffa&quot;&gt;the iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;. Devices with response times below &lt;code&gt;40 ms&lt;/code&gt; were re-measured with a 1000fps camera (&lt;code&gt;1 ms&lt;/code&gt; resolution), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M62I8Q7/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M62I8Q7&amp;amp;linkId=d5f90ebe0b220a8c6e550761f663fb19&quot;&gt;Sony RX100 V&lt;/a&gt; in PAL mode. Results in the tables are the results of multiple runs and are rounded to the nearest &lt;code&gt;10 ms&lt;/code&gt; to avoid the impression of false precision. For desktop results, results are measured from when the key started moving until the screen finished updating. Note that this is different from most key-to-screen-update measurements you can find online, which typically use a setup that effectively removes much or all of the keyboard latency, which, as an end-to-end measurement, is only realistic if you have a psychic link to your computer (this isn't to say the measurements aren't useful -- if, as a programmer, you want a reproducible benchmark, it's nice to reduce measurement noise from sources that are beyond your control, but that's not relevant to end users). People often advocate measuring from one of: {the key bottoming out, the tactile feel of the switch}. Other than for measurement convenience, there appears to be no reason to do any of these, but people often claim that's when the user expects the keyboard to &quot;really&quot; work. But these are independent of when the switch actually fires. Both the distance between the key bottoming out and activiation as well as the distance between feeling feedback and activation are arbitrary and can be tuned. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/&quot;&gt;this post on keyboard latency measurements for more info on keyboard fallacies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant difference is that measurements were done with settings as close to the default OS settings as possible since approximately 0% of users will futz around with display settings to reduce buffering, disable the compositor, etc. Waiting until the screen has finished updating is also different from most end-to-end measurements do -- most consider the update &quot;done&quot; when any movement has been detected on the screen. Waiting until the screen is finished changing is analogous to webpagetest's &quot;visually complete&quot; time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer results were taken using the “default” terminal for the system (e.g., powershell on windows, lxterminal on lubuntu), &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/term-latency/&quot;&gt;which could easily cause &lt;code&gt;20 ms&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;30 ms&lt;/code&gt; difference between a fast terminal and a slow terminal&lt;/a&gt;. Between measuring time in a terminal and measuring the full end-to-end time, measurements in this article should be slower than measurements in other, similar, articles (which tend to measure time to first change in games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;powerspec g405&lt;/code&gt; baseline result is using integrated graphics (the machine doesn’t come with a graphics card) and the &lt;code&gt;60 Hz&lt;/code&gt; result is with a cheap video card. The baseline was result was at &lt;code&gt;30 Hz&lt;/code&gt; because the integrated graphics only supports &lt;code&gt;hdmi&lt;/code&gt; output and the display it was attached to only runs at &lt;code&gt;30 Hz&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;hdmi&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile results were done by using the default browser, browsing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com&quot;&gt;https://danluu.com&lt;/a&gt;, and measuring the latency from finger movement until the screen first updates to indicate that scrolling has occurred. In the cases where this didn’t make sense, (kindles, gameboy color, etc.), some action that makes sense for the platform was taken (changing pages on the kindle, pressing the joypad on the gameboy color in a game, etc.). Unlike with the desktop/laptop measurements, this end-time for the measurement was on the first visual change to avoid including many frames of scrolling. To make the measurement easy, the measurement was taken with a finger on the touchscreen and the timer was started when the finger started moving (to avoid having to determine when the finger first contacted the screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of “ties”, results are ordered by the unrounded latency as a tiebreaker, but this shouldn’t be considered significant. Differences of &lt;code&gt;10 ms&lt;/code&gt; should probably also not be considered significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;custom haswell-e&lt;/code&gt; was tested with &lt;code&gt;gsync&lt;/code&gt; on and there was no observable difference. The year for that box is somewhat arbitrary, since the CPU is from &lt;code&gt;2014&lt;/code&gt;, but the display is newer (I believe you couldn’t get a &lt;code&gt;165 Hz&lt;/code&gt; display until &lt;code&gt;2015&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of transistors for some modern machines is a rough estimate because exact numbers aren’t public. Feel free to ping me if you have a better estimate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color scales for latency and year are linear and the color scales for clock speed and number of transistors are log scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Linux results were done with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/741878/eb6c9d3913d7cb2b/&quot;&gt;pre-KPTI&lt;/a&gt; kernel. It's possible that KPTI will impact user perceivable latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurements were done as cleanly as possible (without other things running on the machine/device when possible, with a device that was nearly full on battery for devices with batteries). Latencies when other software is running on the device or when devices are low on battery might be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a reference to compare the kindle against, a moderately quick page turn in a physical book appears to be about &lt;code&gt;200 ms&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a work in progress. I expect to get benchmarks from a lot more old computers the next time I visit Seattle. If you know of old computers I can test in the NYC area (that have their original displays or something like them), let me know! If you have a device you’d like to donate for testing, feel free to mail it to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon reportedly has Pinkerton agents surveil workers who try to form unions</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/940196997/amazon-reportedly-has-pinkerton-agents-surveil-workers-who-try-to-form-unions</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;storytext&quot; readability=&quot;60&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to documents, Amazon reportedly runs a surveillance program to track activism among its workers. NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Lauren Gurley of Motherboard magazine, who broke the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div aria-label=&quot;Transcript&quot; readability=&quot;131.76511260371&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a century ago, the titans of industry hired private agents to crack down on labor strikes and union organizers at steel mills and factories in the U.S. Those agents were called Pinkerton detectives. Now the giant of a new industry is using the same approach. A story from Vice magazine's Motherboard reports that leaked documents show that Amazon hired Pinkerton operatives in Europe to surveil workers. The story also reports that Amazon monitors workers who try to form unions or take part in protest movements. We need to note that Amazon is an NPR funder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Kaori Gurley is the staff writer who broke this story. When I spoke with her earlier, I asked her to explain what these documents say about how Amazon keeps an eye on employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAUREN KAORI GURLEY: It involves collecting data, it seems, from Facebook groups, from social media. In some cases in the case of the Pinkertons, there is a line in one of the documents that we've obtained that says that Pinkerton operatives were inserted into a warehouse in Wroclaw, Poland, to gather intelligence on what their warehouse workers were up to. They believe that some people were tinkering with the application interview process, so some people were sent in to figure out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAPIRO: This leak focuses on Amazon's operations in Europe. How likely is it that the company is doing similar things in the U.S.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GURLEY: So our source told us that they do the same thing in the U.S. They sort of create - they gather the same intelligence. But one difference is that unlike Europe, there are no Amazon unions in the U.S. No Amazon workers have unionized in the U.S. There have been several failed attempts. But we do know that they're tracking how many people are attending meetings, how many people are joining unions. So I imagine that in the U.S., they're tracking labor organizing activity but not union members yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAPIRO: We asked Amazon for comment, and they told us that they hire Pinkerton to secure shipments. And they said, quote, &quot;We do not use our partners to gather intelligence on warehouse workers.&quot; Is that consistent with what these documents show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GURLEY: No. So - not at all. The documents say Pinkerton operatives were inserted into an Amazon warehouse in Wroclaw, Poland, to investigate an allegation that warehouse workers were circumventing sort of the application process for applying to warehouse jobs, so I would say that it goes directly against what Amazon is saying. They indeed, at least in this one instance we know, if these documents are correct, that Amazon has used Pinkertons explicitly to spy on warehouse workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAPIRO: Amazon also told us that everything they do is fully legal. What does the law say about union organizing activities and surveilling workers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GURLEY: Right. I think the laws are a lot - I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but I believe the laws are a lot stronger in Europe than they are in the United States. In the United States, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 protects workers' rights to join trade unions, to organize, to engage in concerted activities to improve their working conditions. Now, there are also lots of laws that make that difficult. So lots of companies around the United States - it's very common for them to hold anti-union campaigns when workers seek to organize. And it's sort of up to the NLRB, the national labor board. They determine whether that's legal or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAPIRO: This is the busiest shopping season right now in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Does surveillance change at this time of year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GURLEY: Yes. So during what they call peak season - so it's the time between Black Friday and Christmas - they put out a series of reports called peak season reports detailing all sorts of risks to Amazon's operations. These are, like, lists of the protests that are scheduled, the number of people who are - you know, said they'd be attending them on Facebook, the location, the time. And the reason why they do this, I think, is because during the holidays, the workload at Amazon warehouses increases. Workplace injuries are the highest by far if you look at the data. And so this is typically a time when workers stage strikes, walkouts. So Amazon's very also concerned about protecting itself during this time. It's sort of the highest-stakes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAPIRO: That's Lauren Kaori Gurley, a staff writer for Vice's tech magazine Motherboard. Thank you for your time today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GURLEY: Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHAPIRO: And we also reached out to Pinkerton. We've had no response from them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
