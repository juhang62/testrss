<title>Rust 1.32 released</title>
<link>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/01/17/Rust-1.32.0.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/01/17/Rust-1.32.0.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Jan. 17, 2019 Â· The Rust Release Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;235.63190269817&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.32.0. Rust is a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust 1.32.0 is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ rustup update stable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have it already, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html&quot;&gt;get &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1320-2019-01-17&quot;&gt;detailed release notes for 1.32.0&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a small side note, &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt; has seen some new releases lately! To update &lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt; itself, run &lt;code&gt;rustup self update&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in 1.32.0 stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust 1.32.0 has a few quality of life improvements, switches the default allocator, and makes additional functions &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;. Read on for a few highlights, or see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1320-2019-01-17&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The &lt;code&gt;dbg&lt;/code&gt; macro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, a quality of life improvement. Are you a &quot;print debugger&quot;? If you are, and you've wanted to print out some value while working on some code, you have to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;let x = 5;

println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, x);

// or maybe even this
println!(&quot;{:#?}&quot;, x);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the &lt;em&gt;largest&lt;/em&gt; speed bump, but it is a lot of stuff to simply show the value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, there's no context here. If you have several of these &lt;code&gt;println!&lt;/code&gt;s, it can be hard to tell which is which, unless you add your own context to each invocation, requiring even more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rust 1.32.0, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56395/&quot;&gt;we've added a new macro, &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for this purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    
    dbg!(x);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run this program, you'll see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[src/main.rs:4] x = 5
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the file and line number of where this was invoked, as well as the name and value. Additionally, &lt;code&gt;println!&lt;/code&gt; prints to the standard output, so you really should be using &lt;code&gt;eprintln!&lt;/code&gt; to print to standard error. &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; does the right thing and goes to &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even works in more complex circumstances. Consider this factorial example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn factorial(n: u32) -&amp;gt; u32 {
    if n &amp;lt;= 1 {
        n
    } else {
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wanted to debug this, we might write it like this with &lt;code&gt;eprintln!&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn factorial(n: u32) -&amp;gt; u32 {
    eprintln!(&quot;n: {}&quot;, n);

    if n &amp;lt;= 1 {
        eprintln!(&quot;n &amp;lt;= 1&quot;);

        n
    } else {
        let n = n * factorial(n - 1);

        eprintln!(&quot;n: {}&quot;, n);

        n
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to log &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; on each iteration, as well as have some kind of context for each of the branches. We see this output for &lt;code&gt;factorial(4)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;n: 4
n: 3
n: 2
n: 1
n &amp;lt;= 1
n: 2
n: 6
n: 24
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is servicable, but not particularly great. Maybe we could work on how we print out the context to make it more clear, but now we're not debugging our code, we're figuring out how to make our debugging code better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this version using &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn factorial(n: u32) -&amp;gt; u32 {
    if dbg!(n &amp;lt;= 1) {
        dbg!(1)
    } else {
        dbg!(n * factorial(n - 1))
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simply wrap each of the various expressions we want to print with the macro. We get this output instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[src/main.rs:3] n &amp;lt;= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:3] n &amp;lt;= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:3] n &amp;lt;= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:3] n &amp;lt;= 1 = true
[src/main.rs:4] 1 = 1
[src/main.rs:5] n * factorial(n - 1) = 2
[src/main.rs:5] n * factorial(n - 1) = 6
[src/main.rs:5] n * factorial(n - 1) = 24
[src/main.rs:11] factorial(4) = 24
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; macro returns the value of what it's debugging, instead of &lt;code&gt;eprintln!&lt;/code&gt; which returns &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, we need to make &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; changes to the structure of our code. Additionally, we have &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; more useful output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot to say about a little macro, but we hope it improves your debugging experience! We are contining to work on support for &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; and friends as well, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code&gt;jemalloc&lt;/code&gt; is removed by default&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long, long ago, Rust had a large, Erlang-like runtime. We chose to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://jemalloc.net/&quot;&gt;jemalloc&lt;/a&gt; instead of the system allocator, because it often improved performance over the default system one. Over time, we shed more and more of this runtime, and eventually almost all of it was removed, but jemalloc was not. We didn't have a way to choose a custom allocator, and so we couldn't really remove it without causing a regression for people who do need jemalloc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, saying that &lt;code&gt;jemalloc&lt;/code&gt; was always the default is a bit UNIX-centric, as it was only the default on &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; platforms. Notably, the MSVC target on Windows has shipped the system allocator for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while jemalloc &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; has great performance, that's not always the case. Additionally, it adds about 300kb to every Rust binary. We've also had a host of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/36963#issuecomment-252029017&quot;&gt;other issues&lt;/a&gt; with jemalloc in the past. It has also felt a little strange that a systems language does not default to the system's allocator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, once &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/08/02/Rust-1.28.html#whats-in-1.28.0-stable&quot;&gt;Rust 1.28 shipped a way to choose a global allocator&lt;/a&gt;, we started making plans to switch the default to the system allocator, and allow you to use &lt;code&gt;jemalloc&lt;/code&gt; via a crate. In Rust 1.32, we've finally finished this work, and by default, you will get the system allocator for your programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to continue to use jemalloc, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/jemallocator&quot;&gt;the jemallocator crate&lt;/a&gt;. In your &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-toml&quot;&gt;jemallocator = &quot;0.1.8&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in your crate root:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: jemallocator::Jemalloc = jemallocator::Jemalloc;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it! If you don't need jemalloc, it's not forced upon you, and if you do need it, it's a few lines of code away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Final module improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past two releases, we announced several improvements to the module system. We have one last tweak landing in 1.32.0 and the 2018 edition. Nicknamed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56759#issuecomment-450051210&quot;&gt;&quot;uniform paths&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, it permits previously invalid import path statements to be resolved exactly the same way as non-import paths. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }

use Color::*;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; previously compile, as &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; statements had to start with &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;crate&lt;/code&gt;. Now that the compiler supports uniform paths, this code will work, and do what you probably expect: import the variants of the &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; enum defined above the &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this change in place, we've completed our efforts at revising the module system. We hope you've been enjoying the simplified system so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Macro improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few improvements to macros have landed in Rust 1.32.0. First, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56072/&quot;&gt;a new &lt;code&gt;literal&lt;/code&gt; matcher&lt;/a&gt; was added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;macro_rules! m {
    ($lt:literal) =&amp;gt; {};
}

fn main() {
    m!(&quot;some string literal&quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;literal&lt;/code&gt; matches against literals of any type; string literals, numeric literals, &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; literals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2018 edition, &lt;code&gt;macro_rules&lt;/code&gt; macros can also use &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;macro_rules! bar {
    ($(a)?) =&amp;gt; {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; will match zero or one repetitions of the pattern, similar to the already-existing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; for &quot;zero or more&quot; and &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; for &quot;one or more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Library stabilizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked above about the &lt;code&gt;dbg!&lt;/code&gt; macro, which is a big library addition. Beyond that, 19 functions were made &lt;code&gt;const fn&lt;/code&gt;s, and all integral numeric primitives now provide conversion functions to and from byte-arrays with specified edianness. These six functions are named &lt;code&gt;to_&amp;lt;endian&amp;gt;_bytes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;from_&amp;lt;endian&amp;gt;_bytes&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;endian&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is one of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ne&lt;/code&gt; - native endianness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; - little endian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;be&lt;/code&gt; - big endian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1320-2019-01-17&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cargo features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo gained &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6218/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo c&lt;/code&gt; as an alias for &lt;code&gt;cargo check&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6242/&quot;&gt;allows usernames in registry URLs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md#version-1320-2019-01-17&quot;&gt;detailed release notes&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributors to 1.32.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people came together to create Rust 1.32.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.32.0&quot;&gt;Thanks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count the number of people around you ð¨âð¨âð¦ by monitoring wifi signals ð¡.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;howmanypeoplearearound&lt;/em&gt; calculates the number of people in the vicinity using the approximate number of smartphones as a proxy (since &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/conradhackett/status/701798230619590656&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;~70% of people have smartphones nowadays&lt;/a&gt;). A cellphone is determined to be in proximity to the computer based on sniffing WiFi probe requests. Possible uses of &lt;em&gt;howmanypeoplearearound&lt;/em&gt; include: monitoring foot traffic in your house with Raspberry Pis, seeing if your roommates are home, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tested on Linux (Raspbian and Ubuntu) and Mac OS X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It may be illegal&lt;/strong&gt; to monitor networks for MAC addresses, especially on networks that &lt;em&gt;you do not own&lt;/em&gt;. Please check your country's laws (for US &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Section 18 U.S. Code Â§ 2511&lt;/a&gt;) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schollz/howmanypeoplearearound/issues/4&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a video walkthrough on how to install, checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dLzouUfJyMM?t=3m2s&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PNPtutorials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7 or preferably Python 3 must be installed on your machine with the &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; command also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  python -V
  pip -V
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WiFi adapter that supports monitor mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of possible USB WiFi adapters that support monitor mode. Here's a list that are popular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely you want to find a USB adapter with one of the following chipsets: Atheros AR9271, Ralink RT3070, Ralink RT3572, or Ralink RT5572.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  brew install wireshark
  brew cask install wireshark-chmodbpf
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linux &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tshark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install tshark
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then update it so it can be run as non-root:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common     (select YES)
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark ${USER:-root}
newgrp wireshark
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pip install howmanypeoplearearound
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quickstart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run, simply type in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ howmanypeoplearearound
Using wlan1 adapter and scanning &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; 60 seconds...
[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;==================================================&lt;/span&gt;] 100%        0s left
There are about 3 people around.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be prompted for the WiFi adapter to use for scanning. Make sure to use an adapter that supports &quot;monitor&quot; mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Docker alternative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Docker is installed locally and you want to take &lt;em&gt;howmanypeoplearearound&lt;/em&gt; out for a quick spin, you can try the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy Dockerfile from this repo in your current working directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker build -t howmanypeoplearearound .&lt;/code&gt; # that . at the end is important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -it --net=host --name howmanypeoplearearound howmanypeoplearearound&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This Docker alternative is known to work on Ubuntu but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on Mac OS X. Feedback on other platforms would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can modify the scan time, designate the adapter, or modify the output using some command-line options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ howmanypeoplearearound --help

Options:
  -a, --adapter TEXT   adapter to use
  -z, --analyze TEXT   analyze file
  -s, --scantime TEXT  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; seconds to scan
  -o, --out TEXT       output cellphone data to file
  -v, --verbose        verbose mode
  --number             just print the number
  -j, --jsonprint      print JSON of cellphone data
  -n, --nearby         only quantify signals that are nearby (rssi &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; -70)
  --nocorrection       &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; not apply correction

  }
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A higher rssi means closer (one of these phones is mine, and the other two are my roommates' who were upstairs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add &lt;code&gt;--loop&lt;/code&gt; to make this run forever and append new lines an output file, &lt;code&gt;test.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ howmanypeoplearearound -o test.json -a wlan1 --loop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visualize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visualize the output from a looped command via a browser using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ howmanypeoplearearound --analyze test.json 
Wrote index.html
Open browser to http://localhost:8001
Type Ctl+C to &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then just open up &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; in a browser and you should see plots. The first plot shows the number of people over time. Here you can see that people start arriving at work place around 8-9am (when work starts!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550035/26174159/b478b764-3b0b-11e7-9600-2aa215b789d0.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550035/26174159/b478b764-3b0b-11e7-9600-2aa215b789d0.png&quot; alt=&quot;newplot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second plot shows the RSSI values for the mac addresses seen. You can double-click on one of them in particular to highlight that trajectory, as I have done here for my phone (you can see when I leave from and when I arrive to work!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550035/26174160/b4911ae8-3b0b-11e7-93b2-92c3efaa01aa.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550035/26174160/b4911ae8-3b0b-11e7-93b2-92c3efaa01aa.png&quot; alt=&quot;newplot 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;howmanypeoplearearound&lt;/em&gt; counts up the number of probe requests coming from cellphones in a given amount of time. The probe requests can be &quot;sniffed&quot; from a monitor-mode enabled WiFi adapter using &lt;code&gt;tshark&lt;/code&gt;. An acccurate count does depend on everyone having cellphone and also scanning long enough (1 - 10 minutes) to capture the packet when a phone pings the WiFi network (which happens every 1 to 10 minutes unless the phone is off or WiFi is disabled).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simplification of another program I wrote, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schollz/find-lf&quot;&gt;find-lf&lt;/a&gt; which uses a similar idea with a cluster of Raspberry Pis to geolocate positions of cellphones within the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Nothing Can Stop Google. DuckDuckGo Is Trying Anyway</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;06eb&quot; id=&quot;06eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;uckDuckGo is based just east of nowhere. Not in the Bay Area, or New York, or Weinbergâs hometown of Atlanta, or in Boston, where he and his wife met while attending MIT. Instead, DuckDuckGo headquarters is set along a side street just off the main drag of Paoli, Pennsylvania, in a building that looks like a cross between a Pennsylvania Dutch house and a modest Catholic church, on the second floor above a laser eye surgery center. Stained-glass windows look out onto the street, and a small statue of an angel hangs precariously off the roof. On the second floor, a door leading out to a balcony is framed by a pair of friendly looking cartoon ducks, one of which wears an eye patch. Just before DuckDuckGoâs entrance sits a welcome mat that reads âCOME BACK WITH A WARRANT.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b18&quot; id=&quot;8b18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;âPeople donât generally show up at our doorstep, but I hope that at some point itâll be useful,â Weinberg tells me, sitting on a couch a few feet from an &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&lt;/em&gt; mural that takes up a quarter of a wall. At 39, he is energetic, affable, and generally much more at ease with himself than the stereotypical tech CEO. The office around us looks like it was furnished by the set designer of &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;: a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; print in the entryway, Japanese-style panels depicting the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the bathroom, and a vintage-looking &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;RoboCop&lt;/em&gt; pinball machine in the break room. Thereâs even a Lego model of the DeLorean from &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; on his desk. The furniture, Weinberg tells me, is mostly from Ikea. The lamp in the communal area is a hand-me-down from his mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;108.26342525399&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9c2b&quot; id=&quot;9c2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Weinberg learned basic programming on an Atari while he was still in elementary school. Before hitting puberty, heâd built an early internet bulletin board. âIt didnât really have a purposeâ in the beginning, Weinberg says. The one feature that made his bulletin board unique, he says, was that he hosted anonymous AMA-style question panels with his father, an infectious disease doctor with substantial experience treating AIDS patients. This was during the early 1990s, when the stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS remained so great that doctors were known to deny treatment to those suffering from it. Weinberg says that the freeâand privateâmedical advice made the board a valuable resource for the small number of people who found it. It was an early instance of Weinbergâs interest in facilitating access to information, as well as a cogent example of the power of online privacy: âThe ability to access informational resources anonymously actually opens up that access significantly,â he told me over email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d42&quot; id=&quot;9d42&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After graduating from MIT in 2001, Weinberg launched a slew of businesses, none of which are particularly memorable. First there was an educational software program called Learnection. (âTerrible nameâ¦ the idea was good, but 15 years too early,â he says.) Then he co-founded an early social networking company called Opobox, taking on no employees and writing all the code himself. âFacebook just kind of obliterated it,â Weinberg says, though he was able to sell the network to the parent company of Classmates.com for roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1142701/000110465906033409/a06-9620_110q.htm&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1142701/000110465906033409/a06-9620_110q.htm&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$10 million in cash&lt;/a&gt; in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f8f3&quot; id=&quot;f8f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It was around that time when Weinberg began working on what would become DuckDuckGo. Google had yet to achieve total hegemony over the internet search field, and Weinberg felt that he could create a browser plugin that might help eliminate the scourge of spammy search results in other search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;52ec&quot; id=&quot;52ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg bought a billboard in San Francisco that proudly proclaimed, âGoogle tracks you. We donât.â The stunt paid off in spades, doubling DuckDuckGoâs daily searchÂ traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cec7&quot; id=&quot;cec7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;To build an algorithm that weeded out bad search results, he first had to do it by hand. âI took a large sample of different pages and hand-marked them as âspamâ or ânot spam.ââ The process of scraping the web, Weinberg says, inadvertently earned him a visit from the FBI. âOnce they realized I was just crawling the web, they just went away,â he says. He also experimented with creating a proto-Quora service that allowed anyone to pose a question and have it answered by someone else, as well as a free alternative to Meetup.com. Eventually, he combined facets of all three efforts into a full-on search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;93f9&quot; id=&quot;93f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When Weinberg first launched DuckDuckGo in 2008âââthe &lt;a href=&quot;https://duck.co/help/company/name&quot; data-href=&quot;https://duck.co/help/company/name&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;name is a wink to the childrenâs game&lt;/a&gt; of skipping over the wrong options to get to the right oneâââhe differentiated his search engine by offering instant answers to basic questions (essentially an early open-source version of Googleâs Answer Box), spam filtering, and highly customizable search results based on user preferences. âThose [were] things that early adopters kind of appreciated,â he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;63a4&quot; id=&quot;63a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At the time, Weinberg says, consumer privacy was not a central concern. In 2009, when he made the decision to stop collecting personal search data, it was more a matter of practicality than a principled decision about civil liberties. Instead of storing troves of data on every user and targeting those users individually, DuckDuckGo would simply sell ads against search keywords. Most of DuckDuckGoâs revenue, he explains, is still generated this way. The system doesnât capitalize on targeted ads, but, Weinberg says, âI think thereâs a choice between squeezing out every ounce of profit and making ethical decisions that arenât at the expense of society.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*OU-b4th16b49_BUikJUKiQ.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;6381&quot; data-height=&quot;4259&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*OU-b4th16b49_BUikJUKiQ.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*OU-b4th16b49_BUikJUKiQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;53fa&quot; id=&quot;53fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Until 2011, Weinberg was DuckDuckGoâs sole full-time employee. That year, he pushed to expand the company. He bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2011/01/duckduckgo-google-privacy/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2011/01/duckduckgo-google-privacy/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a billboard in Googleâs backyard&lt;/a&gt; of San Francisco that proudly proclaimed, âGoogle tracks you. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; donât.â (That defiant gesture &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncubed.com/daily/the-best-and-worst-of-startup-billboards/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://uncubed.com/daily/the-best-and-worst-of-startup-billboards/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;and others like it&lt;/a&gt; were later parodied on HBOâs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl4HWvvNwo8&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl4HWvvNwo8&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) The stunt paid off in spades, doubling DuckDuckGoâs daily search traffic. Weinberg began courting VC investors, eventually selling a minority stake in the company to Union Square Ventures, the firm that has also backed SoundCloud, Coinbase, Kickstarter, and Stripe. That fall, he hired his first full-time employee, and DuckDuckGo moved out of Weinbergâs house and into the strangest-looking office in all of Paoli, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;49ae&quot; id=&quot;49ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Then, in 2013, digital privacy became front-page news. That year, NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a series of documents to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.0a2a22e68c6e&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.0a2a22e68c6e&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealing the existence of the NSAâs PRISM program, which granted the agency unfettered access to the personal data of millions of Americans through a secret back door into the servers of Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Apple, and other major internet firms. Though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/google-statement-on-nsa-infiltration-of-links-between-data-centers/2013/10/30/75f3314a-41b3-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html?utm_term=.59f4e9b5887b&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/google-statement-on-nsa-infiltration-of-links-between-data-centers/2013/10/30/75f3314a-41b3-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html?utm_term=.59f4e9b5887b&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google denied&lt;/a&gt; any knowledge of the program, the reputational damage had been done. DuckDuckGo rode a wave of press coverage, enjoying placement in stories that offered data privacy solutions to millions of newly freaked-out people worried that the government was spying on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e600&quot; id=&quot;e600&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;âAll of a sudden we were part of this international story,â Weinberg says. The next year, DuckDuckGo turned a profit. Shortly thereafter, Weinberg finally started paying himself a salary.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DNS Flag Day on February 1, 2019: check your domains</title>
<link>https://dnsflagday.net</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dnsflagday.net</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo&quot; alt=&quot;DNS flag day logo&quot; src=&quot;https://dnsflagday.net/images/DNS_Flag.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;social&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt; is unnecessarily slow and suffers from inability to deploy new features. To remediate these problems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnsflagday.net/#supporters&quot;&gt;vendors of DNS software&lt;/a&gt; and also big &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnsflagday.net/#supporters&quot;&gt;public DNS providers&lt;/a&gt; are going to remove certain workarounds on February 1st, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change affects only sites which operate software which is not following published standards. Are you affected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please check if your domain is affected:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On or around Feb 1st, 2019, major open source resolver vendors will release updates that implement stricter EDNS handling. Specifically, the following versions introduce this change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BIND 9.13.3 (development) and 9.14.0 (production)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knot Resolver already implemented stricter EDNS handling in all current versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PowerDNS Recursor 4.2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unbound 1.9.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://dnsflagday.net/#supporters&quot;&gt;public DNS providers listed below&lt;/a&gt; will disable workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For introduction to EDNS compliance we recommend you to use form above which produces simplified result for a whole domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to test your DNS servers directly using the tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://ednscomp.isc.org/ednscomp&quot;&gt;ednscomp&lt;/a&gt; which displays detailed technical report. Simply enter the name of a zone hosted on your DNS servers into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;zone name&lt;/code&gt; field and click the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ednscomp.isc.org/ednscomp&quot;&gt;ednscomp&lt;/a&gt; tests should preferably be a green message &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All Ok&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal working setup which will allow your domain to survive 2019 DNS flag day must not have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/code&gt; result in any of plain DNS and EDNS version 0 tests implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ednscomp.isc.org/ednscomp&quot;&gt;ednscomp&lt;/a&gt; tool. Please note that this minimal setup is still not standards compliant and will cause other issues sooner or later. For this reason &lt;strong&gt;we strongly recommend you to get full EDNS compliance (all tests &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt; instead of doing just minimal cleanup otherwise you will have to face new issues later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a problem, the ednscomp tool displays an explanation for each failed test. Failures in these tests are typically caused by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;broken DNS software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;broken firewall configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remediate problems please upgrade your DNS software to the latest stable versions and test again. If the tests are still failing even after a DNS upgrade please check your firewall configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firewalls must not drop DNS packets&lt;/strong&gt; with EDNS extensions, including unknown extensions. Modern DNS software may deploy new extensions (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7873&quot;&gt;DNS cookies&lt;/a&gt; to protect from DoS attacks). Firewalls which drop DNS packets with such extensions are making the situation worse for everyone, including worsening DoS attacks and inducing higher latency for DNS traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main change is that DNS software from vendors named above will interpret timeouts as sign of a network or server problem. Starting February 1st, 2019 there will be &lt;strong&gt;no attempt to disable EDNS&lt;/strong&gt; as reaction to a DNS query timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effectivelly means that all DNS servers which &lt;strong&gt;do not respond at all to EDNS queries&lt;/strong&gt; are going to be treated as &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please test your implementations using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ednscomp.isc.org/ednscomp&quot;&gt;ednscomp&lt;/a&gt; tool to make sure that you handle EDNS properly. Source code of the tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/DNS-Compliance-Testing&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that EDNS is still not mandatory. If you decide not to support EDNS it is okay as long as your software replies according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891#section-7&quot;&gt;EDNS standard section 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researches and other parties like TLD operators might be interested in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read respective methodologies before interpreting the data. In any case, do not hesitate to reach out to tool authors using Gitlab links above.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The creeping IT apocalypse</title>
<link>https://forrestbrazeal.com/2019/01/16/cloud-irregular-the-creeping-it-apocalypse/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://forrestbrazeal.com/2019/01/16/cloud-irregular-the-creeping-it-apocalypse/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2812&quot; src=&quot;https://forrestbrazeal.com/images/cloud-irregular.png&quot; alt=&quot;cloud-irregular&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, Iâm trying a thing. A newsletter thing. Iâm not sure if this will work, or how often I will do it. Probably not more frequently than once a month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In each issue of âCloud Irregularâ, Iâll try to provide a useful piece of commentary on some tech-related topic. After that Iâll let you know about any new stuff Iâve published, or upcoming talks. Then Iâll give you something extremely silly, just to cleanse your palate, and weâll be done.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sound good? If so, throw in your email at the bottom of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18930781&quot;&gt;HackerNews comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-creeping-it-apocalypse&quot;&gt;The creeping IT apocalypse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2019/aws-everyone-new-clues-emerge-amazons-secretive-low-code-no-code-project/&quot;&gt;AWS is working on a clandestine low-code/no-code product codenamed âAWS for Everyoneâ&lt;/a&gt;. Itâs useless to speculate on this without concrete info (though that didnât stop Geekwire), but hopefully this isnât just another half-baked attempt to simplify the process of application development past all recognition. An awful lot of smart people have been trying to make graphical interfaces to help non-programmers code since - what, pre-Visual Basic? - and those projects always seem to get bogged down by a) fundamental limitations of usefulness or b) horrifying snarls of technical debt, or c) both of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the real trend to watch here is not that the cloud providers are making it easier for non-technical people to code (although they are), but that they are &lt;em&gt;straight-up reducing the number of people required to deliver technical solutions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve been saying for awhile now that weâre getting close to a crisis point in the IT world. The mid-tier IT worker is in imminent danger of being automated out of existence, and just like with the vanished factory jobs of the last 30 years, nobody wants to admit itâs happening until itâs too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT automation apocalypse will move slowly (by tech standards), so it is flying under the radar. Unlike with the collapse of American manufacturing, we wonât get breathless feature articles and political posturing. A shuttered factory and 700 unemployed workers are concrete, easily visible; a decaying Rust Belt town makes an arresting photo spread. But how do you build a narrative around midlevel IT engineers let go in twos and threes from jobs that even they probably canât quite describe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the first people to feel the pain will not be the highly-paid, conference-trotting Very Important Programmers in job-rich tech hubs. They will be anonymous Windows administrators and point-and-click DBAs and âsenior application developersâ who munge JSON in C#. Normal people making comfortable money, fifty to eighty thousand dollars a year in ordinary places like Omaha and Memphis and Santa Fe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether they and their bosses realize it yet or not, all these people are doing work that is not unique or proprietary to their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud scale has enabled AWS and Azure and Google to identify patterns that are common across customers and industries. Look at Googleâs suite of natural language processing services, or AWSâs steady creep up the stack with development automation services like AppSync and Amplify. Once the providers build it, nobody else has to. I mean, you could, but the opportunity cost gets harder and harder to justify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, itâs not that these tools have democratized IT or software development, exactly. Rather, theyâve enabled technical work to be done by a vastly smaller absolute number of people. (This is also the primary selling point of âserverlessâ computing, by the way, though itâs not quite polite to say so.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the cloud services are expensive. So are the robots used in warehouses and on factory floors. But theyâre less expensive than a bunch of humans with health benefits. And the average mid-sized financial services company or industrial shop is not doing cutting edge work that requires a lot of groundbreaking programmers anyway. IT is overhead, for them. Way better to pay Azure for a DevOps service than to hire a dedicated DevOps engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies still need tech-savvy people, of course, just like factories need people on the floor. But instead of five backend developers and three ops people and a DBA to keep the lights on for your line-of-business app, now you maybe need two people total. Those two people make great money, theyâre plenty busy, and they have lots of technical challenges to solve. But theyâre not managing a database cluster or babysitting a build server or writing giant stored procedures to do some non-differentiated task, like OCR on insurance forms. The cloud provider can do that (and is adding more capabilities all the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a zero-sum game of outsourcing, like people feared 15 years ago. These jobs have been distributed via the economy of scale to a small number of domain specialists working for service providers. Theyâre disappearing into the cloud, and theyâre never coming back, and too many of my fellow tech workers arenât prepared for whatâs about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve spent my career in tech, almost a decade at this point, running about a step-and-a-half ahead of the automation reaper. I was an IT field engineer maintaining server blades until they turned into EC2 instances. I was a DevOps DBA building SQL Server clusters on top of AWS EC2; then RDS got better and that wasnât a good use of manpower anymore. I was a CI/CD tool builder for internal development teams - cloud providers and service companies now make better versions of those tools available at cloud scale. Just about every role Iâve had in tech has become an inefficiency, sometimes due in part to my own efforts. The work has been automated out of existence, and I have moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you know if your job is going to disappear into the cloud? You donât really need me to tell you. You already feel it in your bones. Repetition is a sure warning sign. If youâre building the same integrations, patching the same servers over and over again every day, congratulations â youâve already become a robot. Itâs only a matter of time before a small shell script makes it official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is simple, but not easy: you simply must keep moving. If you donât know how to code, learn - like planting a tree, the best time to start was ten years ago, but the second best time is now. If your technical competence is ten years out of date, donât cling to your hard-won kingdom of decaying knowledge and sabotage any attempts at change: get out and pick up a certification, attend a meetup, something. Anything. At the end of the day, weâre all self-taught engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, Iâll tell you what will happen. The economy will take a small dip, or your department will get re-orged, and you will lose that job as an operations engineer on a legacy SaaS product. Youâll look around for a similar job in your area and discover that nobody is hiring people anymore whose skill set is delivering a worse version of what AWSâs engineers can do for a fraction of the cost. And by then you wonât have the luxury of time to level up your skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please donât be that person. If you need some advice on where to take your career, feel free to reach out â Iâll offer any help I can. Because you can definitely stay ahead of the IT automation apocalypse. It just requires serious personal effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâs how I know this is gonna get real bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;links-and-events&quot;&gt;Links and Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youâre in the Raleigh, NC area on January 24th, I hope youâll join me at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/TriangleServerless/events/257885233/&quot;&gt;Triangle Serverless Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, where Iâll be speaking on serverless data patterns and telling you about the most embarrassing moment of my IT career. If youâre not in Raleigh, I believe the atrocities will be streamed on Triangleâs YouTube and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâll also be making a trip to the Bay Area March 18-20th for a couple of speaking engagements. Iâll have some free time, so please give me a shout if youâre from around there and want to meet up and talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://read.acloud.guru/how-serverless-is-breaking-down-barriers-in-tech-9b32d7fbf9e7&quot;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; Stackeryâs Farrah Campbell for A Cloud Guru. She has a provocative perspective on how the serverless community is eliminating gatekeepers and democratizing tech. Worth a readâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a ton of time over the year-end holiday digging deep on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trek10.com/blog/dynamodb-single-table-relational-modeling/&quot;&gt;relational modeling in DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt;. Code is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In non-tech writing news, I had a couple of fictional stories published this month: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/future-societies/forrest-brazeal/world-war-2841-release-notes&quot;&gt;World War 2.8.41 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; at Daily Science Fiction, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://menacinghedge.com/winter2019/entry-brazeal.php&quot;&gt;Deathâs Head in B Dorm&lt;/a&gt; at Menacing Hedge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-for-fun&quot;&gt;Just For Fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In each newsletter, Iâll try to put something completely silly and useless, just in case youâre afraid of getting too much value out of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today: Disney Foxes, Ranked By Wokeness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breâr Fox from &lt;em&gt;Song of the South&lt;/em&gt;. A racist fox. Not woke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fox from the fox hunt in &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins&lt;/em&gt;. An Irish revolutionary fox. Awake, but unwoke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tod from &lt;em&gt;The Fox and the Hound&lt;/em&gt;. A very boring fox, not a political fox at all. Well, I guess he is a bit of a gun control or animal rights fox. Slightly woke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robin Hood from &lt;em&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/em&gt;. A democratic socialist fox. Likely favors a 100% marginal tax rate on the rich. Woke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nick Wilde from &lt;em&gt;Zootopia&lt;/em&gt;. Sort of the opposite of Breâr Fox. An extremely woke fox. Perhaps - dare I say - overly woke, for a fox. What am I saying, a fox canât be too woke. Our winner!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;(If the words âfoxâ and âwokeâ look meaningless to you now, my work here is done!)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft pledges $500M for affordable housing in Seattle area</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/microsoft-affordable-housing-seattle.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/microsoft-affordable-housing-seattle.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;SEATTLE â The Seattle area, home to both Microsoft and Amazon, is a potent symbol of the affordable housing crisis that has followed the explosive growth of tech hubs. Now Microsoft, arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom, is putting up $500 million to help address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoftâs money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated, particularly on the West Coast. It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the companyâs own non-tech workers, but also for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoftâs move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing. The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs. Microsoft, which is based in nearby Redmond, Wash., and has few employees who work in the city, did not take a position on the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country, particularly as Amazon, with billions of taxpayer subsidies, announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va., that would employ a total of at least 50,000 people. In New York, elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;âWe believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role,â said Brad Smith, Microsoftâs president and chief legal officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The companyâs strong finances, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/microsoft-apple-worth-how.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;a sign of its resurgence&lt;/a&gt; under Satya Nadella as chief executive, have given it resources to deploy, Mr. Smith said. In October, the company reported net income of $8.8 billion in its most recent quarter, up 34 percent, and it had almost $136 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The companyâs stock has risen steadily under Mr. Nadella, and Microsoft is now valued at over $800 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A number of other tech businesses have tried to address the homeless crisis. Amazonâs chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has supported homeless service providers through his personal foundation, and the Salesforce chief executive, Marc Benioff, helped fund a proposition in San Francisco to tax businesses to pay for homeless services. Voters &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/technology/san-francisco-business-tax-homeless.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the tax in November, rejecting opposition from some tech leaders, including Twitterâs chief executive, Jack Dorsey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Others plan to build housing for their own employees. Such housing may help with demand, but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;âThis is long-range thinking by a company that has been around for a long time, and plans to be around for a long time,â said Margaret OâMara, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft began researching the regionâs housing last summer, after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market. The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work. The areaâs home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years, and Mr. Smith said he learned that âthe region has counterintuitively done less to build middle-income housing than low-income housing, especially in the suburbs.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The availability of affordable housing in the Seattle area has not kept pace with growth fueled by tech giants like Microsoft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ruth Fremson/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That squeeze hits a range of workers. âOf course, we have lots of software engineers, but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft. Cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers,â Mr. Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the companyâs headquarters. âIt is a supply problem, a market failure.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft plans to lend $225 million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middle-income housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters. It will put an additional $250 million into low-income housing across the region. Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for low-income housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The company plans to invest the money within three years, and expects most of it to go to Seattleâs suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The loans could go to private or nonprofit developers, or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority. As the loans are repaid, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The remaining $25 million will be grants to local organizations that work with the homeless, including legal aid for people fighting eviction. The Seattle Times &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/microsoft-pledges-500-million-to-help-develop-affordable-housing-in-seattle-and-on-eastside/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that if the $500 million were put into one project, it would create only about 1,000 units, so instead Microsoft will most likely put smaller amounts in many projects to help build âtens of thousands of units.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The initial reaction to the companyâs announcement was positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;âThere is almost no level of housing that isnât direly needed,â said Claudia Balducci, a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.kingcounty.gov/initiatives/affordablehousing.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in December by the task force said that the region needs 156,000 more affordable housing units, and will need 88,000 more units by 2040 to accommodate future growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A growing body of research has tied the lack of affordable housing to increasing homelessness. A December &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.zillow.com/research/homelessness-rent-affordability-22247/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the real estate website Zillow said that was particularly true when households pay more than a third of their income in rent. The New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle regions â the countryâs largest tech hubs â have all already crossed that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;âThe idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just doesnât work anymore,â said Steve Schwartz, head of public affairs at Tableau Software, which is based in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon in recent years has worked closely with Maryâs Place, a homeless shelter for women and children in Seattle, and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/amazon-homeless-shelter-seattle.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;is integrating a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/technology/amazon-homeless-shelter-seattle.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;shelter&lt;/a&gt; for about 65 families into one of its new buildings. Amazon has paid tens of millions of dollars to the cityâs affordable housing trust fund as fees to build in the core of Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amazon declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Google supported the City of Mountain Viewâs plan to add 10,000 housing units in an area itâs developing, with 20 percent designated for lower-income residents. And Facebook &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/facebook-zucktown-willow-village.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;has planned&lt;/a&gt; to build 1,500 apartments near its Menlo Park headquarters, with 15 percent to be affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Microsoft has begun a major overhaul of its main campus in Redmond, committing billions of dollars in renovations and connecting it to a light rail station under construction. The company helped finance a successful campaign for voters to approve more property taxes to pay for transportation. This new investment in housing takes its commitments a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;âThis is where Microsoft is going to be, and the region needs to work,â Ms. Balducci said. âI donât think this is wholly altruism.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Mastercard will stop free trials from automatically billing once they&amp;#039;re over</title>
<link>https://newsroom.mastercard.com/2019/01/16/free-trials-without-the-hassle/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://newsroom.mastercard.com/2019/01/16/free-trials-without-the-hassle/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;No one wants to be unsatisfied with a physical product after paying for it. For some consumers, a free-trial is a great way to test out a new product and get comfortable with it before making a purchasing decision. And with so many merchants offering free product trials,Â theyâre becoming the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes a free trial of a skincare or healthcare product can unwittingly turn into a recurring product subscription that is difficult to cancel. These situations can be frustrating and costly for both consumers and their banks.Â &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/online_fraud.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-13650 alignright&quot; src=&quot;https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/online_fraud.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;M&quot; width=&quot;315&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Mastercard, we want every commerce engagement to be simple, safe and secure and we are introducing rules for merchants that offer free-trials to make this a hassle-free experience for their consumers. The rule change will require merchants to gain cardholder approval at the conclusion of the trial before they start billing. To help cardholders with that decision, merchants will be required to send the cardholder â either by email or text â the transaction amount, payment date, merchant name along with explicit instructions on how to cancel a trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each payment thereafter, the merchant will have to send a receipt to the cardholder for each transaction by email or text message with clear instructions on how to cancel the service if the consumer so desires.Â  In addition, all charges that appear on the cardholderâs statement must now include the merchant website URL or the phone number of the store where the cardholder made the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free trial offers can be a legitimate and useful way to increase sales and improve consumer satisfaction. The new rules will help in increase transparency and ensure an outstanding experience for cardholders. In addition to these changes, Mastercard cardholders are also covered by our Zero Liability policy which protects them against unauthorized purchases or charges. If a cardholder suspects that a transaction is fraudulent or unusual, we encourage them to contact the bank that issues their card for assistance and more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*This blog was updated on January 17, 2019 to clarify that the rule change is applicable to physical products such as skincare, healthcare items etc.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Find Hidden Cameras and Spy Gear</title>
<link>https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/blog/post/how-to-find-hidden-cameras/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/blog/post/how-to-find-hidden-cameras/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is without a doubt most thorough guide to detecting hidden cameras and covert spy gear that is online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The simple strategies that we are going to show you will effectively clear most rooms for hidden cameras and bugs without having to use super expensive countersurveillance gear or an outside company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the processes and steps that we are going to show you are adopted from some of our best government agencies, where countersurveillance is of a grave concern to them, so these techniques have been tried and tested&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the best part about this guide?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyone can do it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This post will reveal the exact step-by-step process that we use to sweep for covert spy gear and cameras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let's get started!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sweeping For Hidden Cameras &amp;amp; Devices Is Becoming A Necessity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just in the past couple of years, we have seen a rise in hidden cameras and spy gear being used in nefarious ways, targeting guests that stay on cruise lines, in hotel rooms, Airbnb houses, the list goes on. Unfortunately, this trend does not seem to be going away anytime soon, but you can, however, take measures to ensure that you are not a victim. In this post, we will show you exactly how to do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What Type of Device Could Be Used Against Me?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before sweeping the room in question, you should first try to determine what type of surveillance equipment, if any, would be used against you in your specific situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/what_kind_of_gear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Probability of finding a Hidden camera&quot; height=&quot;410&quot; width=&quot;410&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, if you find yourself staying at a bed and breakfast or a hotel, you would most likely find surveillance equipment that would utilize video to capture compromising clips or photos of the occupants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are in a business meeting environment like a conference room, you could assume that the intelligence being gathered would encompass important conversations and interactions between parties. The most likely device to be used in this situation and environment would be an audio recorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When sweeping a room for surveillance equipment, Keep this in the back of your mind and pay close attention to the areas of the room that are the most vulnerable and compromising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Â Â Â Â Â 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Break Your Bug Sweep Down Into These Steps:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 1: Enter The Room Assuming You Are Under Surveillance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If this is your first time staying in a new hotel or an Airbnb, automatically assume that you are currently being recorded and surveilled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But relax! No need to panic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Odds are in your favor that you are not being monitored, but you still want to sweep your location to be 100% sure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/chances.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Probability of finding a Hidden camera&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Think of it like riding in a vehicle and putting your seatbelt on. Chances are you won't need it, but you will be glad you put it on if you do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it is always best to just assume you are being recorded until you are 100% certain the room is clear of all surveillance equipment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 2: Split The Room Into Quadrants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start off by standing in the center of the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, split the room into quadrants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have identified your quadrants and your start points, go through each quadrant one at a time and clear it, using the techniques in this guide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Splitting the room into sections will help you to systematically and meticulously go through the room and clear each section without skipping over any of the fine details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/quad_22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using quadrant method to find Hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 3: Start Off By Making Basic Observations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perform a general scan and pay attention to anything that looks out of place or appears suspicious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there duplicate items in the room? Such as clocks, smoke detectors or coffee pots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there any unusual holes in the walls or ceiling?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are any of the items in the room positioned in an unusual way?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check all of the appliances like televisions, clocks, phones, hair dryers, and coffee pots for exposed wiring, suspicious lights, or anything that looks abnormal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/look_around.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Look around for hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 4: Check Every Outlet And Identify What Is Plugged Into Each Socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All surveillance devices require a power source; whether that power source is powered by an electrical outlet or a wireless battery may depend on how long you are expected to occupy the room and if the perpetrator has access to your room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Devices that run on batteries have limited lifespans, however, those that run on electrical power can be used for constant and long-term surveillance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conduct a sweep of the outlets and identify everything that is plugged into them. Pay close attention to anything plugged in that may seem out of place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/plugs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using quadrant method to find Hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What About Video Surveillance And Audio Recorders?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any type of video surveillance device would be positioned in a way that would provide the best opportunity to capture footage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, a video surveillance device would be aimed at the bathroom, in front of the dresser where one would get changed, or aimed at the bed. It is important to be aware of all choke points or high traffic areas in the room that would force occupants to take a certain path or occupy a certain area in the room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some areas to pay attention to are the bathroom door, the front door, and all hallways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/choke_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chokepoints for Hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is important to pay special attention to locations where conversations would take place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If someone wanted to plant surveillance equipment in a room with the specific intent of capturing crystal clear audio of a conversation between parties, they would place the device(s) in any area people are expected to gather.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some areas to pay close attention to are beds, tables, couches, chairs, desks, and balconies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Objects Or Amenities That Could Be Vulnerable To Surveillance Equipment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do the devices and appliances in your room match the other devices and appliances in the rest of the room or house?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are any of them placed in peculiar positions or locations?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are these devices different from room to room?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Always keep an eye out for smoke detectors, thermostats, outlets, fixtures, and bulbs. Normally, common sense would suggest these devices should all match and remain relatively similar since they are usually original to the construction of the room or building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/sockets.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Hidden cameras sockets&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;5px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could suggest an anomaly that should be inspected further. More importantly, are there similar devices found from room to room that are placed in peculiar positions or locations?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This could also suggest an anomaly that should be inspected further. During your sweep, you should always ask yourself these questions and inspect further if warranted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does the artwork in the room match the dÃ©cor or the theme of the room or house you are occupying?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is more common than not for hotels and rented rooms to have a common theme or dÃ©cor pattern.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, a modern hotel would have mostly modern dÃ©cor, fixtures, furniture, and appliances. A rustic Bed and Breakfast might have older furniture with an old world charm. Keep an eye out for fixtures and pieces of dÃ©cor that seem out of place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/beach_pictures.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Hidden camera beach pictures&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;5px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;span/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Know The Ammenties That Are Offered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is always recommended to be very knowledgeable and aware of the services and amenities of the location you are staying in and compare those standards to the devices and appliances in your room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For instance, if the room is listed to have one coffee pot, but you see two in your room, inspect them both for anomalies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If coffee is offered downstairs, is the coffee pot in your room supposed to be there?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you see more than one clock in your room?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most websites will list expected room amenities and devices, but you can always call the front desk and ask if you are unsure of what devices and amenities should be in your room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/hotel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Hidden amenities&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; width=&quot;520&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your room has ceiling tiles, are they part of a drop ceiling system or are they build into the ceiling?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there any holes in them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do any of the tiles seem to stick out above the others or sit differently?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your room has a drop ceiling where the ceiling tiles can easily be pushed up, inspect them and make sure there are not any surveillance devices hidden above them if you are suspicious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check The Mirrors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is always recommended to inspect every mirror in your room to ensure it is not a two-way mirror.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best way to check for a two-way mirror is by using your fingertip. On most mirrors, if you place your fingertip on the mirror, the reflection of it will not touch. Instead, it will leave a quarter inch gap or so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/mirror_good.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; mirror without spy camera&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you put your fingertip on the mirror and the reflection is touching your finger, you should inspect it further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/mirror_caution.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; mirror with spy camera&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is important to note that some establishments like bars or gas stations may use a metal back with a mirror tint instead of using a real mirror, which will give the appearance of it being a 2 way mirror. This is meant to prevent the mirror from shattering and becoming a liability for the business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another technique is to shut off the lights and shine a flashlight through the mirror to see if there is anything behind it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's Take A Deeper Look:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you have completed a visual and physical inspection, it is suggested to take a closer look at all suspicious objects, devices, or locations, using a few countersurveillance tools that are easy to use and best of all, affordable. They will be used to find the surveillance devices that you were unable to locate with a visual inspection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 1: Purchase A Radio Frequency (RF) Detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most long-term surveillance devices will need a way to transmit the information back to the surveyor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;An RF detector works by scanning the area in search of devices emitting radio waves and once detected will produce an audible tone for the user that fluctuates as the device is detected closer or further away. This will continue until the user is ultimately able to locate the device emitting radio waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Commercial spy devices usually transmit in a range of 10 MHz to 8 MHz. Most RF detectors will detect them and scan from 10 hertz all the way to 24 GHz. Professional Grade RF detectors have an even broader RF range in addition to a ton of specialized features. However, these devices are expensive and could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your specific situation will determine the level of detection you would need. The average person using an RF detector to simply sweep a hotel room or an AirBnB room can get away with a simple device that will detect and locate unknown RF transmissions. You can purchase a quality &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/professional-audio-video-and-tracking-bug-detector.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;RF detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, such as the one below, that will get the job done for a little over $100.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/professional-audio-video-and-tracking-bug-detector.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_11.26.02_PM.png&quot; alt=&quot; Rf detector&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 2: Pick Up A Camera Lens Detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;RF detectors will only detect wireless devices that transmit information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What about stand-alone devices that save the information to an SD card?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For that, it would be beneficial to have a camera lens detector at your disposal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A camera lens detector works by detecting the reflection of light off of the lens of a recording camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When using a camera lens detector, the lens of a camera will sparkle or illuminate on the viewing screen indicating to the user that a camera may be present.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are looking for an all-in-one device that has the ability to detect both RF and a camera lens, the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/lawmate-dd802-defender.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lawmate Defender DD802&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would be an excellent choice. This is a professional grade device that will be very effective in detecting and locating both RF and camera lenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/lawmate-dd802-defender.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/691_00.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Rf detector with lens detector&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 3: Turn Off All Emitters Before Sweeping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before beginning your sweep with an RF detector, it is important for you to ensure all devices that could possibly emit an RF signal be fully and completely powered down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be sure to power down all cell phones, Bluetooth devices, laptop computers, tablets, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is also a good idea to test your RF detector before your sweep by turning it on and sweeping over your cell phone. If your RF detector is able to detect the frequency being emitted from your cell phone, it is functioning correctly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_190517783-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;electronic devices&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 4: Conduct Your Sweep &quot;Painting&quot; The Walls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pick the edge of one of your quadrants and start &quot;painting&quot; the walls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Painting&quot; the walls simply means to slowly and methodically walk up and down the walls and scan them visually and with your RF detector in a painting motion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While completing this process, you should also be visually inspecting the walls looking for any sort of disturbances or unusual anomalies, while at the same time keeping an ear out for your RF detector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will paint the walls until you have reached the end of your quadrant. If nothing was detected on that pass, you should mark that quadrant clear for any transmitting devices and move to the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_507538078.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paint the walls for hidden cameras&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 5: &quot;Paint&quot; The Walls Using A Camera Lens Detector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following the same &quot;painting&quot; method as before, repeat the same process in each quadrant using your camera lens detector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 6: Turn Off The Lights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turn off the lights and look for any tiny lights that seem out of the ordinary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most spy cameras have indicator lights that will tell the user if the camera is recording or powered. If the surveyor neglected to turn these indicator lights off, you can use their mistake to your advantage by easily detecting and locating them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_382611709_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;recording lights&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step 7: Use Your Phone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order to record video at night, most spy cameras will need some type of Infrared (IR) technology to effectively illuminate the scene digitally so that the footage being recorded is visible in complete darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;True Infrared Radiation (IR) lighting is ideal for use in covert surveillance because it is not detectable by the human eye. The visible wavelengths are from approximately 390 to 700 nm while the Infrared spectrum range is 700 nm to 1000000 nm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/em_spectrum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ir visible spectrum&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One quick and cost-effective way to detect IR light is by using the front-facing camera on your phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unlike the rear-facing camera, the front-facing camera does not have an IR filter and can easily pick up IR lights in the dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To try this at home, grab your TV remote, which uses IR light to send information to your TV and open the front-facing camera on your phone. Next, point the front end of the remote at the camera and press any of the remote buttons. The IR light that is normally not visible will be completely visible on your camera screen. IR light is easy to conceal and hide from unsuspecting victims of surveillance. Keep this in mind when conducting your sweep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What About Thermal Detection?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One more device to be aware of that will aid in the detection of surveillance equipment is a thermal imaging camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any type of surveillance device, whether it is video, audio, or IR, it will emit some sort of heat signature that would be easily detected with a thermal imaging device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most surveillance cameras emit a fair amount of heat due to their small size and the fact that they are normally enclosed in something discreet that does not provide much ventilation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FLIRÂ® offers an outstanding device called the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flir.com/products/flir-one-gen-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FLIRÂ® ONE Gen 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that connects to your smartphone and allows it to be used as a thermal imaging camera.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flir.com/products/flir-one-gen-3/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_6.41.14_PM.png&quot; alt=&quot; Flir thermal imaging&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A thermal imaging camera device like this will help you locate hot spots in the room directly on your phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you locate a hot spot behind a wall, a picture, a smoke detector, or behind any other device or location that seems unusual or peculiar, you should be able to detect the anomaly. At that time, it would be appropriate to take a closer look and inspect for surveillance devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What To Do If You Locate A Surveillance Device:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you do encounter a surveillance device, do not disturb it. Immediately walk out of view of the camera and call the authorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/shutterstock_1044868723.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; call the police&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; margin=&quot;10px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the newer surveillance cameras use motion detection with a loop-recording feature for the SD card. There have been quite a few cases of the perpetrator inadvertently recording themselves placing and walking away from the device because of this feature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By staying out of the camera view, you reduce the chance of recording over any of the old footage should the SD card become full. If the perpetrator did record themselves on the camera, it is obviously best to minimize the chance of that footage becoming recorded over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may ask yourself what are the legalities of a hidden camera? Check out this &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senteltechsecurity.com/blog/post/blog-9/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; post for more info.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;American investors have lost the fiercest advocate they may have ever had.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;John Clifton Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group and a crusader for investorsâ rights for more than three decades, died in Bryn Mawr, Pa., on Wednesday at age 89. The cause of death was cancer, said Mr. Bogleâs assistant, Michael Nolan.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;âIf all investors had heeded his ideas, they would be hundreds of billions of dollars better off than they are now,â financier Warren Buffett told The Wall Street Journal in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Through the sheer force of his will, Mr. Bogle, known as Jack, almost singlehandedly made index fundsâwhich hold virtually every security in a given marketâa practical and popular option for institutional and individual investors alike. He created the first mutual fund tied to an index in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;âJack Bogle made an impact on not only the entire investment industry, but more importantly, on the lives of countless individuals saving for their futures or their childrenâs futures,â Vanguard Chief Executive Tim Buckley said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Under Mr. Bogle, who retired as Vanguardâs chief executive in 1996, Vanguard continually cut the costs of investing, eventually stoking a fee war that roiled an entire industry and created a money-management giant in the Philadelphia suburb of Malvern. Vanguard is now the second-largest asset manager in the world, with $4.9 trillion in assets under management at the end of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;His campaign to cut fees put Mr. Bogle squarely into an American tradition of iconoclastic discounters like Henry Ford of Ford Motor, Sam Walton of Walmart and Michael Dell of Dell Inc.âmen who built giant companies by selling directly to the consumer at rock-bottom prices.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;By putting the ability to own a stake in the entire stock market into the hands of any investor who could scrape together what was for many years Vanguardâs required account minimum of $3,000, Mr. Bogle helped democratize financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Holders of index funds can match the market for a fraction of the cost of traditional funds. The resulting savingsâbillions of dollars a yearâhave gone straight into investorsâ own pockets. Vanguardâs asset-weighted average fee has fallen in the past 20 years to 0.10% from 0.27%, according to






            &lt;a href=&quot;https://quotes.wsj.com/MORN&quot;&gt;Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


      Many traditional funds still demand 1% or more. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogle was alone among mutual-fund leaders in having his own groupiesâa following of investors who are dedicated to his principles of low-cost, long-term investing. Members of an official group of these fans call themselves âBogleheads.â In a speech in 2005, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson praised Mr. Bogleâs creation of the retail index fund as equal in importance to âthe invention of the wheel, wine and cheese, the alphabet and Gutenberg printing.â&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogleâs championing of index funds may also have had unintended negative consequences. By enabling anyone to own a broad swath of the market at minimal cost, some critics say index portfoliosâespecially in the form of exchange-traded fundsâmay have encouraged excessive trading, higher volatility and a lower sensitivity to the risk of overvaluation. ETFs trade like stocks on exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;p&gt;Born in Montclair, N.J., on May 8, 1929, Mr. Bogle and his twin brother David arrived five months before the Great Crash that began that October wiped out much of their familyâs wealth. Mr. Bogle delivered papers and worked as a waiter growing up.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;At Blair Academy and Princeton University, Mr. Bogle said he initially struggled with the subject of economics. An article about the mutual-fund industry in the December 1949 issue of Fortune magazine inspired his 1951 senior thesis, titled âThe Economic Role of the Investment Company.â He graduated from Princeton &lt;em&gt;magna cum laude &lt;/em&gt;in economics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogleâs first job in the investment world was as a clerk to Walter L. Morgan, who founded the first-ever balanced mutual fund at Wellington Management.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Despite his eventual advocacy for index funds, Mr. Bogle was contemptuous early in his career of the idea that trying to beat the market was a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In 1960, under the pen name John B. Armstrong, he wrote a lengthy article for the Financial Analysts Journal in which he ridiculed the very idea âthat the mutual fund itself should buy the market average,â or settle for a return no better than that of a benchmark like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&amp;amp;P 500 index. In 1973, he gave a speech insisting that âthe average individual is getting âabove-indexâ results in mutual fundsâ and that âneither compensation of salesmen, nor profitability of broker-dealers and underwriters, is excessive.â&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Only after he was fired as Wellingtonâs president in 1974 by his partners and launched Vanguard as an independent company the following year did Mr. Bogle challenge the industryâs prevailing orthodoxy that price was a signal of quality and embrace low-cost investing.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogle chose to organize Vanguard as a mutual company, an idea he said he had unsuccessfully pitched to his Wellington colleagues years earlier. Along the lines of a consumer cooperative, the firm would beâand still isâowned not by private shareholders who seek to maximize their own profits but rather by its fund investors, who earn higher returns as Vanguard drives costs lower. In 1977, Vanguard also went âno-load,â eliminating the sales commissions and all middlemen on its funds. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bogleâs insistence on integrity, which often struck many of his competitors as sanctimonious, steered Vanguard clear of the scandals that periodically swept through the mutual-fund industry. Still, when it came to corporate governance, Mr. Bogle became a greater proponent of index and other funds harnessing their power on shareholder votes after his tenure at Vanguard than he was during it. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;At Vanguard, Mr. Bogle paid himself well but not lavishly, though he and other firm executives have never publicly disclosed those figures. Mr. Bogle frowned on ostentation, driving a Volvo station wagon, vacationing in Lake Placid, N.Y., flying economy class and haggling for discounts at hotels.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Vanguard continues to take a similarly thrifty approach to its business at its Malvern campus, whose plain brick buildings bear the names of warships. Mr. Bogle, a fan of British Adm. Horatio Nelson, named the firm Vanguard after Adm. Nelsonâs ship in the 1798 Battle of the Nile and referred to employees as âcrew.â&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Despite Mr. Bogleâs age and lengthy career, he had chronic coronary failure and suffered at least seven heart attacksâthe first at age 31. He endured a malfunctioning pacemaker before finally receiving a heart transplant in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;âI didnât think about [dying],â he told an interviewer in 2007. âI just got on with what needed to be done.â&lt;/p&gt;
