<title>Rust&amp;#039;s 2019 Roadmap</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apr. 23, 2019 · The Rust Core Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;90.316163410302&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year the Rust community &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1728&quot;&gt;comes together&lt;/a&gt; to set out a roadmap. This year, in addition to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/27/Rust-survey-2018.html&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, we put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/call-for-rust-2019-roadmap-blogposts.html&quot;&gt;call for blog posts&lt;/a&gt; in December, which resulted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://readrust.net/rust-2019/&quot;&gt;73 blog posts&lt;/a&gt; written over the span of a few weeks. The end result is the recently-merged &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2657-roadmap-2019.md&quot;&gt;2019 roadmap RFC&lt;/a&gt;. To get all of the details, please give it a read, but this post lays out some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, 2019 will be a year of &lt;em&gt;rejuvenation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;maturation&lt;/em&gt; for the Rust project. We shipped a lot of stuff last year, and grew a lot. Now it's time to take a step back, take stock, and prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work we have planned for this year falls into three major categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Governance: improving how the project is run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish long-standing requests: closing out work we've started but never finished&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polish: improving the overall quality of the language and tooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last three years, the Rust project has grown a lot. Rust used to have a core team of 8 members. When we added sub-teams in 2015, we grew to 23 members. We've now grown to over 100 — that's bigger than many companies! And of course, looking beyond the teams, the size of the Rust community as a whole has grown tremendously as well. As a result of this growth, we've found that the processes which served us well when we were a smaller project are starting to feel some strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the teams have announced plans to look over revamp their processes to scale better. Often this can be as simple as taking the time to write down things that previously were understood only informally — sometimes it means establishing new structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this widespread interest in governance, we've also created a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/governance-working-group-announcement/9637&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance Working Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This group is going to be devoted to working with each team to hone its governance structure and to help pass lessons and strategies between teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the RFC process has been a great boon for Rust, but as we've grown, there have been times where it didn't work so well too. We may look at revisions to the process this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long-standing requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of exciting initiatives that have been sitting in a limbo state — the majority of the design is done, but there are some lingering complications that we haven't had time to work out. This year we hope to take a fresh look at some of these problems and try hard to resolve those lingering problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Cargo team and custom registries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Language team is taking a look at async/await, specialization, const generics, and generic associated types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Libs team wants to finish custom allocators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Polish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last few years have also seen a lot of foundational work. The compiler, for example, was massively refactored to support incremental compilation and to be better prepared for IDEs. Now that we've got these pieces in place, we want to do the “polish” work that really makes for a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compile times and IDE support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polishing the specification of the language by improving &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/&quot;&gt;the reference&lt;/a&gt; and laying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines&quot;&gt;the unsafe code guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WebAssembly WG's work this year includes polishing our wasm support, for example, debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post only covered a few examples of the plans we've been making. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2657-roadmap-2019.md&quot;&gt;If you'd like to see the full details, take a look at the RFC itself.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to a great 2019 for Rust!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Court Says Using Chalk on Tires for Parking Enforcement Violates Constitution</title>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time parking enforcement officers use chalk to mark your tires, they might be acting unconstitutionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court ruled Monday that &quot;chalking&quot; is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was brought by Alison Taylor, a Michigan woman whom the court describes as a &quot;frequent recipient of parking tickets.&quot; The city of Saginaw, Mich., like countless other cities around the country, uses chalk to mark the tires of cars to enforce time limits on parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Taylor received her 15th citation in just a few years, she decided to go after the city — and specifically after parking enforcement officer Tabitha Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoskins, Taylor alleged in her lawsuit, was a &quot;prolific&quot; chalker. Every single one of Taylor's 15 tickets was issued by Hoskins after she marked a tire with chalk, and then circled back to see if Taylor's car had moved. That chalking, Taylor argued, was unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trespassing upon a privately-owned vehicle parked on a public street to place a chalk mark to begin gathering information to ultimately impose a government sanction is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,&quot; Taylor's lawyer, Philip Ellison, wrote in a court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit unanimously agreed. Chalking tires is a kind of trespass, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/19a0076p-06.pdf&quot;&gt;Judge Bernice Donald&lt;/a&gt; wrote for the panel, and it requires a warrant. The decision affects the 6th Circuit, which includes Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fourth Amendment protects people from &quot;unreasonable searches and seizures.&quot; To determine whether a violation has occurred, the court first asks whether the government's conduct counts as a search; if so, it asks whether the search was reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court found that chalking is indeed a &quot;search&quot; for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, because government officials physically trespass upon a constitutionally protected area to obtain information. Just as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2012/01/23/145656654/top-court-police-need-warrant-for-gps-tracking&quot;&gt;Supreme Court ruled in 2012&lt;/a&gt; that sticking a GPS tracker to a car counted as a &quot;search,&quot; so is marking a tire with chalk to figure out how long it has been parked, the court wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that search wasn't reasonable, the court said. The city searches vehicles &quot;that are parked legally, without probable cause, or even so much as 'individualized suspicion of wrongdoing' — the touchstone of the reasonableness standard,&quot; the court wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Fascinating CA6 opinion today holding that chalking a tire for parking enforcement -- to see if the car had been there a while in violation of parking rules -- violates the 4th Amendment. Not sure where I come out on it, but fun issue. Here's a thread. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2MtCtAb9e6&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2MtCtAb9e6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/N?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#N&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GOGjL0RUGk&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GOGjL0RUGk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Orin Kerr (@OrinKerr) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1120412475466375168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don't think everyone deserves free parking,&quot; Ellison, the attorney who brought the case, told The Associated Press. &quot;But the process Saginaw selected is unconstitutional. ... I'm very glad the three judges who got this case took it seriously. It affects so many people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law professor Orin Kerr, noting that he had never seen a chalking case before, said parking enforcement officers could sidestep the constitutional issue altogether by simply taking a photo of the car rather than using chalk. &quot;That way parking enforcement can learn the placement of the car [without] physically marking it,&quot; Kerr &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1120412520987209728&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her Facebook page, Taylor — the recipient of frequent parking tickets — delighted in the fact that future law students would get to read about her case while studying the Fourth Amendment. &quot;That's definitely the most exciting part!&quot; she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/alicat422/posts/10205450087049346?comment_id=10205450181051696&amp;amp;reply_comment_id=10205450333775514&amp;amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;I've helped change the law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>They think they are above the law: the firms who own America&amp;#039;s voting system</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/22/us-voting-machine-private-companies-voter-registration</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/22/us-voting-machine-private-companies-voter-registration</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aryland congressman Jamie Raskin is a newcomer to the cause of reforming America’s vote-counting machines, welcomed through baptism by fire. In 2015, Maryland’s main election system vendor was bought by a parent company with ties to a Russian oligarch. The state’s election officials did not know about the purchase until July 2018, when the &lt;a href=&quot;https://elections.maryland.gov/press_room/documents/July%2013%20Press%20Statement.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;FBI notified&lt;/a&gt; them of the potential conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI &lt;a href=&quot;https://elections.maryland.gov/about/documents/HIRT_Engagement_Report_Maryland_State_Board_of_Elections_FINAL.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; and did not find any evidence of tampering or sharing of voter data. But the incident was a giant red flag as to the potential vulnerabilities of American democracy – especially as many states have outsourced vote-counting to the private sector. After all, the purchase happened while Russian agents were mounting multiple disinformation and cybersecurity campaigns to interfere with America’s 2016 general election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To say that they don’t have any evidence of any wrongdoing is not to say that nothing untoward happened,” Raskin said. “It’s simply to say that we don’t have the evidence of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that democracy in the United States is now largely a secretive and privately-run affair conducted out of the public eye with little oversight. The corporations that run every aspect of American elections, from voter registration to casting and counting votes by machine, are subject to limited state and federal regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are privately-owned and closely held, making information about ownership and financial stability difficult to obtain. The software source code and hardware design of their systems are kept as trade secrets and therefore difficult to study or investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for election vendors is small and the “customer base” mostly limited to North America and centered on the US, meaning that competition is fierce. The result is a small network of companies that have near-monopolies on election services, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/files/270-the-business-of-votin&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;building voting machines&lt;/a&gt;. Across the spectrum, private vendors have long histories of errors that affected elections, of obstructing politicians and the public from seeking information, of corruption, suspect foreign influence, false statements of security and business dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these companies are the safekeepers of American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A corner of the computer security world has been sounding the alarm since voting machines were adopted after the punch-card disaster of the 2000 election recount in Florida. Now lawmakers, election officials and national security experts are joining in on the clamor after Russian agents probed voting systems in all &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/04/dhs-fbi-say-election-systems-in-50-states-were-targeted-in-2016/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;50 states&lt;/a&gt;, and successfully breached the voter registration systems of &lt;a href=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/politics/images/boe_flash_aug_2016_final.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Arizona and Illinois&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Voting machines are set up in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the 2016 presidential election.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5fcb2f0f2812a20b654c77161fb2e11569a3dc9/0_160_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=c84013da1acbe4034b589583f36496d4&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Robert Mueller’s report and a previous indictment of 12 Russian agents confirmed Russians also targeted private vendors that provided election software. The Russians successfully breached at least one company, its name redacted in the reports, “and installed malware on the company network”, according to the Mueller report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence agencies expect cyber attacks from Russia, China and other nations against America’s democracy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;continue in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Raskin learned that there are next to no federal laws that govern or regulate private sector companies involved in US election infrastructure, he hurriedly introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6435/text&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would prevent states from contracting with firms owned or influenced by non-US citizens. He plans to reintroduce an updated version of the bill in this legislative session, he told the Guardian. While it has a decent chance of passing the Democratic-controlled House, it would require Republican support in the Senate to become law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article229016119.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;That is not likely&lt;/a&gt;. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell has been antagonistic to election reform bills, as has the whole Republican party. The party narrative is that Democrats are trying to use the federal government to take over state and local elections; the political angle is that recognizing vulnerabilities or flaws in the election system could raise doubts about the legitimacy of the party’s – and Donald Trump’s – victory in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raskin’s bill could affect at least two of the largest election companies. Dominion Voting Systems, which is the second-largest voting machine vendor in the US, is based in both the US and Canada. Scytl, which provides voter registration services and other online election management tools, is based in Spain. ByteGrid, the Maryland elections contractor, is no longer owned by the Russian parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigners say, however, that foreign ownership of an election vendor is not the only potential security problem. No matter who owns them, voting machines are more vulnerable to insider malfeasance than any other sector of the election industry, and no sector has a longer documented history of US-based ownership with clear partisan ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, for example, when voting machines were rapidly spreading across the country with the help of federal funds, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/aug/24/uselections2004.usa&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;the CEO&lt;/a&gt; of one of the largest companies and a top fundraiser for then president George W Bush said he was “committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to that statement and a litany of other scandals – such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2003/10/did-e-vote-firm-patch-election/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;leaving&lt;/a&gt; an internet-facing server unprotected and revealing the source code for its machines or by installing unapproved software patches on its machines just before an election – that company, Diebold, sold off the election-machine portion of its company in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the push for more transparency, computer scientists and academics have been buying voting machines and hacking them. The most famous example came out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/DEF%20CON%2025%20voting%20village%20report.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;2017 Defcon&lt;/a&gt; hacking conference where computer scientists released a report describing how they hacked a suite of voting machines and the poor computer programming they found. As a result, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elections.virginia.gov/Files/Media/Agendas/2017/20170908BWP.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Virginia decertified&lt;/a&gt; their voting machines and moved to paper ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting machine companies have been actively seeking to avoid this type of scrutiny. They have sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1spgbhYRHNWTMFBnAAlj56NjN5xGBDWQ9/view&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;threats of litigation&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2008/03/17/interesting-email-sequoia/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;academics&lt;/a&gt; researching their machines. They have also blocked litigation seeking records from the machines when there were errors in vote counts and have &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mb4ezy/top-voting-machine-vendor-admits-it-installed-remote-access-software-on-systems-sold-to-states&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;lied to journalists&lt;/a&gt; and to elected officials about the fact that some machines could be accessed remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oregon senator Ron Wyden, in a speech at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://echo360.org/lesson/G_cb3ec0ac-f27e-44bb-8e22-0b65b17cc91c_24303292-7317-429a-9947-90afd7603cf0_2019-03-14T08:15:00.000_2019-03-14T10:00:00.000/classroom#sortDirection=desc&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;election security conference&lt;/a&gt; in Washington DC, said that the voting machine lobby “literally thinks they are just above the law, they are accountable to nobody, [and] they have been able to hotwire the political system in certain parts of the country like we’ve seen in Georgia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyden was referring to the fact that Brian Kemp, who is now Georgia’s governor after overseeing his own election while secretary of state, appointed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/firm-close-ties-georgia-stir-concerns-about-voting-system-purchase/HVK4wcNsEAKO0Xa0ptLLKM/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;ES&amp;amp;S lobbyist&lt;/a&gt; as his deputy chief of staff. Meanwhile, the state is in the process of purchasing more than $150m in new voting machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My view is that the maintenance of our constitutional rights should not depend on the sketchy ethics of these well-connected corporations that stonewall Congress, lie to public officials and have repeatedly gouged taxpayers,” Wyden said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, weak state or federal guidance leaves many cybersecurity companies doing whatever they want, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jfranklin.me/prez/DEFCON26-FINAL.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Joshua M&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jfranklin.me/prez/DEFCON26-FINAL.pdf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, president and co-founder of Outstack Technologies, a cybersecurity company that helps protect campaign and election infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;There are no technical standards from the US federal government on the security of voter registration systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;pullquote-cite&quot;&gt;Joshua M Franklin&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are no technical standards or best practices from the US federal government on the security of voter registration systems,” Franklin said. “One to two pages [of guidelines] don’t cut it. Similarly, we are missing technical security specifications that election night reporting or blank ballot distribution systems must meet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like voting machine vendors, companies providing voter registration and election-night reporting services have their own history with security lapses and false statements. Very little is known about the contracts and relationships between states and voter registration vendors such as PCC and Scytl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was discovered three days before the 2018 midterms that &lt;a href=&quot;https://whowhatwhy.org/2018/11/04/kemps-aggressive-gambit-to-distract-from-election-security-crisis/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;poor cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; left Georgia’s voter registration system vulnerable to being altered, it was unclear whether the state or the company were &lt;a href=&quot;https://whowhatwhy.org/2018/11/06/brian-kemp-and-his-staff-caught-in-a-string-of-falsehoods/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;responsible for the failures&lt;/a&gt;. Computer security experts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article221423980.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; the systems of two other states also served by PCC. One of the coding problems also existed in North Carolina and Washington, though the way the states used PCC’s product muted the potential hazard faced in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information on which states PCC contracts with is hard to come by, with the best data seemingly on PCC’s own website. PCC claims that its technology is responsible for the registration for nearly 25% of US voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case when companies provide their own industry data with little oversight, it is not clear how true their information is. The Guardian found that at least two listed clients, Indiana and New Jersey, either have never directly contracted with PCC or have not done so in a decade. New Jersey is no longer listed as a client for voter registration services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency and trust in every stage of election systems is important because it affects how well voters trust that the system is fair, campaigners say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the dominant private sector makes that difficult. Not only are the companies largely free from public records requests, they are often asked to investigate or police themselves, according to election law expert Candice Hoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is unheard of, for instance in a bank, that if they have anomalies or a potential hack that they need to investigate, that they are supposed to call the software licensor or the software company and get them to examine their own software and decide whether their software was hacked or flawed in some way,” Hoke said. “Absolutely preposterous. And yet we allow that in our elections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, counties simply do not have the expertise or funding to do investigations, and there is currently little state or federal infrastructure in place to solve this problem. Voters, civil rights groups and activists have taken to the courts, but legal rules say plaintiffs need a certain amount of evidence to file a lawsuit, Hoke said. Yet they cannot get that information – held by the private election vendors – without a judge allowing discovery during that lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is through the courts or legislation, Hoke is clear about what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need independent auditing and forensics assessments and other kinds of IT assessments that are not controlled by the vendors,” Hoke said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was amended on 23 April 2019 to clarify that Dominion Voting Systems operates both in the US and Canada, rather than just Canada as previously stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity to let our minds wander can give humans a surprising edge against advancing technologies in the battle for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;callout-frontiers-copy&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is part of an &lt;span&gt;MIT SMR&lt;/span&gt; initiative exploring how technology is reshaping the practice of management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-sidebar&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/content/uploads/2019/04/MAG-Waytz-FR-OP-Leisure-2400x2400-1-300x300.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on which forecasts you believe, we should be either &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176517302811&quot;&gt;moderately&lt;/a&gt; concerned or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244&quot;&gt;extremely&lt;/a&gt; concerned about robots taking our jobs in the near future. From truck drivers to lawyers to those designing the robots themselves, nobody is safe from being replaced by software, algorithms, and machines. Now that we are face-to-face (or face-to-screen) with that threat, an entire cottage industry has emerged around dispensing advice on how to prepare for it. Much of this advice centers on mastering skills that robots ostensibly cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What skills are needed to avoid being automated out of a job? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryalton/2018/01/29/how-should-millennials-prepare-for-the-coming-robotic-revolution/#8e1e06f10580&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; article suggests the answer is all of them: “The more skills, knowledge, and experience you have, the less likely you are to be replaced or automated, so acquire whatever you can, as fast as you can.” But this “more is more” approach isn’t sustainable, especially given the rapidly changing nature of work and the imperative to keep learning and adapting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recommending specific areas for development, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2018/07/7-skills-that-arent-about-to-be-automated&quot;&gt;management&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robots-jobs-automation-employment-training_n_5a0c3f77e4b0b17ffce184a1&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/12/28/how-we-can-best-prepare-for-job-automation/#1464186b28ba&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/upshot/how-to-prepare-for-an-automated-future.html&quot;&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; tend to focus on two broad classes of skills that distinguish people from machines — what I’ll refer to as &lt;em&gt;sociability&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;variability&lt;/em&gt;. But homing in on those areas can still lead to burnout, leaving us even more vulnerable to obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It’s Exhausting to Be Human&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin to social and emotional intelligence, sociability involves understanding others’ emotions and seeing situations from alternative points of view, or what social psychologists call perspective-taking. It’s a skill set that enables empathic collaboration with colleagues and customers, and many organizations are making it a priority for employee development. The retail pharmacy chain Walgreens, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagobusiness.com/health-care/new-walgreens-program-blurs-lines-between-pharmacy-retail&quot;&gt;launched an initiative&lt;/a&gt; for its pharmacists and beauty consultants to undergo empathy training to help cancer patients find products to manage treatment side effects such as hair loss, dry skin, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push for employees to master sociability — increasingly common now that &lt;em&gt;empathy&lt;/em&gt; has become a corporate buzzword — may partly be a response to the rise of automation. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-12471-006&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; I conducted with Harvard Business School marketing professor Michael Norton, we found that people are particularly averse to robots taking jobs that require social and emotional skills (think social worker), but they are more comfortable with robots taking jobs that require analytical skills (think data analyst). Though the respondents were speaking for themselves, not for their employers, organizations seem inclined to divvy up work along similar lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variability, the second skill set experts urge us to develop in the automation age, is our capacity for managing change and variety at work. Robots are extremely good at doing the same thing over and over, and so, we logically assume, humans should be more dynamic. What does variability look like in practice? It largely involves three things: detecting outliers, multitasking, and learning. Detecting outliers means responding to information that is rare or unexpected. People tend to do this more effectively than machines. Recently, for example, automaker Tesla attempted to fully automate its assembly line but discovered its robots could not manage “&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/elon-musk-wasnt-wrong-about-automating-the-model-3-assembly-line-he-was-just-ahead-of-his-time/&quot;&gt;unexpected orientations of objects&lt;/a&gt;,” which then required the attention of human workers. Multitasking and learning, the other two manifestations of variability, are workplace skills we’ve been talking about for some time. In the current era, however, they’ve taken on greater urgency as pressure builds for employees to work faster and stay relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that work involving sociability and variability can feel meaningful and motivating, applying these skills nonstop is exhausting. Jobs that require high levels of sustained sociability — for instance, nursing and customer service — are some of the most susceptible to burnout and what psychologists call compassion fatigue, which can impair job performance and increase turnover. Jobs that require a great deal of variability — those for which people must continually shift between roles or tasks, develop new skills, or keep many things cooking at once — can be similarly draining, with negative consequences for job performance and turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;article-ad ad-300 ad-loop ad-300x600&quot;&gt;&lt;h6&gt;advertisement&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leisure as a Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because sociability and variability, the qualities that set us apart from machines, are so taxing, leisure has become increasingly necessary for workers who fear being replaced by automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who feel threatened should &lt;em&gt;relax&lt;/em&gt;? Yes, that’s my argument, not because people are worry-free, but because worrying tends to make matters worse and leisure could actually give them an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organizations are recognizing the importance of leisure for preventing burnout generally — forcing employees to take more vacation, giving them dedicated free time at work, turning off work email after hours, and my personal favorite, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/17/one-companys-genius-way-to-free-employees-from-email-on-vacation.html&quot;&gt;implementing an on-holiday autoreply to email&lt;/a&gt;, as Daimler has done. To encourage employees to take real time off, the German automaker allows them to select an email setting that automatically deletes messages sent to them during vacation, lets senders know that the recipient will never see the messages, and encourages senders to email again after a specified date or to contact someone else. Programs like this one typically intend to reverse or prevent the negative effects of an always-on work culture. The 24-7 workplace simply keeps us plugged into our work, whereas the push toward sociability and variability makes that work more demanding. Leisure can mitigate the depleting effects from both sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Benefits of a Wandering Mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond reducing employee burnout, however, leisure serves an additional function in the age of automation. Leisure itself is an activity that robots cannot perform, and it might actually make us better thinkers and workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I visited the San Francisco Bay Area to interview people in the technology industry for my research on the psychological consequences of automation, I asked everyone I met the same question: “What is something a human can do that a robot cannot?” Henry Wang, a former venture capitalist associate who worked on investments in companies involved in artificial intelligence, gave my favorite answer: “A robot’s mind cannot wander.” Of course, this is supposed to be the advantage of robots, because it allows them to always stay on task. But this also means they cannot experience any of the benefits of mind-wandering, a state that occurs when we are at leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several lines of research suggest that mind-wandering is associated with specific cognitive benefits. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188691000601X&quot;&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, whose minds are prone to wandering off task perform better than non-ADHD adults in real-world creative pursuits such as the visual arts and score higher on a laboratory test of creative original thinking. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612446024&quot;&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt;, participants who twice took a simple creativity test (for instance, “How many unusual uses can you generate for a paper clip?”) performed better the second time around if given a nondemanding activity such as a simple memory task to spur mind-wandering before retaking the test. They came up with ideas that were more unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What explains these findings? &lt;a href=&quot;https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspa0000148&quot;&gt;Recent studies&lt;/a&gt; led by Dartmouth psychologist Meghan Meyer (and coauthored by me) suggest one possible answer. We found that people who are highly successful in real-world creative pursuits and laboratory creative tasks are better at thinking beyond the here and now and show increased neural activity in brain regions involved in this type of thinking. In other words, highly creative people think more deeply about different points in time (the past and present), different places, and alternative realities. What does that have to do with the cognitive benefits of leisure? By encouraging our minds to wander, leisure activities pull us out of our present reality, which in turn can improve our ability to generate novel ideas or ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Again, this is something robots don’t experience. You can turn a machine off and on to reboot it, but this simply simulates sleep. Leisure is more than that. When we let our minds drift away from work, we return to our tasks capable of tackling them in more inventive and creative ways. By prioritizing leisure, we can nurture and protect the qualities that set humans apart and improve work in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m Kevin Burton, the creator of Polar and I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past six months I’ve been working on a project to address the problems with the current Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar is a new type of app which helps you build a personal knowledge repository and keeps all your reading in one place. It allows you to annotate all your documents including highlighting and manage them with tags and notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar also supports advanced features like spaced repetition (so you never forget anything again) and web archival so you can view a document forever even if it’s deleted on the original site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it’s the starting ramp for a more long term vision around content sharing and knowledge collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll touch upon this in a minute but Polar is something I’ve been thinking about for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put - I want to reboot the Internet and take it to a time when data and knowledge was shared more freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar is the platform I’m building to enable this vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Polar as another layer on top of the existing Internet which includes easy content sharing, annotations, and archival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end I’m starting a crowdfunding campaign to keep Polar open source and really put the project into overdrive - and I need your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we’re going to raise twenty five thousand dollars from our current user base over the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We polled our users and asked them what they would be willing do donate and the average was twenty seven dollars, and of course we have thousands of users - so I think this is a reasonable goal. Now of course, if you’d like do donate more than $27 don’t let me stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to allow donors to convert their donations to Polar Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a link below to the crowdfunding campaign and also one directly in Polar when you’re ready to donate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve raised this initial round, we’re then going to use that momentum to raise $150k from the Internet as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly through a system like Kickstarter or Indiegogo but we’re still investigating our options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should get us through the next 6-9 months and allow us apply for grants to continue supporting development over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant application process itself can take 3-6 months but the funding could be much larger and allow us to build something really special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-your-support-will-help-polar&quot;&gt;How Your Support Will Help Polar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money will help us improve usability, reliability and focus on feature requests from our user base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’re planning on adding mobile support including iOS and Android and improving our user interface (including a dark mode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also going to implement a new viewer to support most popular document formats including ePub and Mobi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly we’re going to focus on team sharing and collaboration. These are two major features of Polar we haven’t shipped yet but they’re the ones I’m most excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot under the surface of Polar that you haven’t seen yet. Mostly architectural work but I think we’re really close to something amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve included links below to our roadmap if you’re interested in exactly what we’d like to accomplish..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long term goal is to have Polar financially self sufficient but in order to get there we need more time to expand our initial user base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;freemium-model&quot;&gt;Freemium Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar will be funded by a freemium model with 95% of users using Polar for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I want to continue to keep Polar Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s vital that a tool that holds your personal knowledge repository is built on a foundation that you can trust isn’t going to simply vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar’s primary funding long term will be supported by sales of Polar premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will always support using Polar as Open Source and users can build from source code directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re will also have free versions of Polar which will be very easy to install and without annoying ads or nagging you to constantly upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;premium-versions&quot;&gt;Premium Versions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium versions of Polar designed to be very affordable - $4.99 per month - about the price of a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we haven’t generated enough value for you that you wouldn’t buy me a cup of coffee I think we’re doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve included a rough feature breakdown so you can see what features we intend on charging for at each level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds we raise will primarily be used to allow me to concentrate on Polar but also bring in additional developers who are more skilled in specific areas including UI, design and React development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;polar-is-important&quot;&gt;Polar is Important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar is an important project for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very passionate about open content and open source and have devoted the last 20 years of my life to fighting for the open web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of the inventors of RSS and podcasting and helped create many projects within the Apache Software Foundation including Apache Maven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last ten years I’ve been running a search company I started named Datastreamer which is a petabyte-scale search engine which I built to index large scale web content on behalf of our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m deeply troubled with the way the Internet is becoming more and more locked up behind walled gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re in the middle of a data war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Facebook, and Elsevier want to lock up the web and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But knowledge dies without oxygen. Science literally can’t work without active peer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also something that directly impacts education as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College has become a bubble with students taking on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt just to finish their degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of textbooks alone has increased 1000% in the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s sad is that we’re losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook made 53 billion dollars last year. By comparison, Wikimedia, which shares their data openly, raised $100M in donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means Facebook made 530x more than Wikimedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s a bit of an apples to oranges comparison but the challenge is that strictly non-profit organizations generally tend to lag behind for-profit corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Twain once said that by the time the truth is out of bed a lie is half-way around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel the same about open and closed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed data models have the potential for such massive revenues that open data just lags behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar is more of a long term vision around distributed content and knowledge sharing which I think can break down these walled gardens and reboot the web to a time when content and knowledge was shared more freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m so focused on Polar becoming economically self sufficient is that large organizations like Facebook have such a massive amount of cash compared to non-profits like Wikimedia that this puts us at a major disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want Polar to be able to stand by itself and have the capital needed to reboot the Internet but at the same time not infringe on the rights of our user base or lock up portions of the Internet the way other companies have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edmund Burke said that for evil to win is for good men to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an uphill battle - but we’re in this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your support.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Sell Onions on the Internet</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/vidalia-onions-in-field.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/vidalia-onions-in-field-300x225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vidalia Onions in the field&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-186&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/vidalia-onions-in-field-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/vidalia-onions-in-field-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/vidalia-onions-in-field.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Vidalia Onions to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re classified as a sweet onion, and because of their mild flavor (they don’t make your eyes tear up), some folks can eat them like an apple. Most of my customers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a phone order one season – 2018 I believe – a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to ‘&lt;em&gt;take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad&lt;/em&gt; ‘. That story made me smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks who love Vidalias, &lt;em&gt;love Vidalias&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me stop, though. I don’t want to get ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did all this start? I’m a web guy. I’m not a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I’M ADDICTED TO DOMAIN NAMES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, it &lt;u&gt;didn’t&lt;/u&gt; start with an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, the domain name &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vidaliaonions.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;VidaliaOnions.com&lt;/a&gt; expired, and went up for auction. For some reason the original owner abandoned it, and being a GA native, I recognized it ’cause I was familiar with the industry. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;been buying expired or abandoned domain names&lt;/a&gt; for a while, and enjoy developing them into niche businesses. This one was different though – I backordered the domain as a spectator, but for kicks &amp;amp; giggles, I dropped in a bid around $2,200 ’cause I was confident I’d be outbid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 minutes later, I was the proud owner of VidaliaOnions.com. I had no idea what to do with it. Ready, fire, aim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the domain landed in my account, I attempted to re-focus my attention on other projects, but the name kept clawing me. Like it was saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… yoo-hoo… over here… 😘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/william-faulkner-bench-480.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;William faulkner statue on bench&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-189&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/william-faulkner-bench-480.jpg 480w, https://www.deepsouthventures.com/wp-content/uploads/william-faulkner-bench-480-300x224.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Faulkner had an interesting perspective on writing his characters – on how &lt;em&gt;they essentially wrote themselves&lt;/em&gt;, and how &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; (Faulkner) served as a sortof mechanical in-between. His quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I would say to get the character in your mind. Once he is in your mind, and he is right, and he’s true, then he does the work himself. All you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says… You’ve got to know the character. You’ve got to believe in him. You’ve got to feel that he is alive… After that, the business of putting him down on paper is mechanical.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://faulkner.lib.virginia.edu/display/wfaudio21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;[source]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Faulkner treats his characters, I treat domain name projects. I buy them with an intention to develop. And I let &lt;u&gt;them&lt;/u&gt; take the lead. They’re the inspiration for the business itself. They guide me towards what they need to become. I’m just the dude behind the keyboard (sorta).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I buy them at auction, sometimes I buy them from original-owners. But universally, the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t usually rush into development. The path of some domains is apparent before I acquire. Others, the path reveals itself down the road. Vidalia was the latter. And after I acquired it, it kept nudging me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build me… build me… you know how. And you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what I should be…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry &amp;amp; David every year, and I should mimic that same service for Vidalia Onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to-door Vidalia Onions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea, but daunting to approach. I’m not a farmer, I don’t have employees, I don’t have a packing shed. And I have no logistics or distribution system setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the domain name kept staring at me. ಠ~ಠ ////&lt;em&gt;whispering&lt;/em&gt;////&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just start..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“take the path to Nothing, and go Nowhere until you reach it.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;em&gt;-the tao of pooh&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I did. I’m just dumb enough to try a project of this complexity. The market size justified an online venture. Google Trends showed strong search volume for the phrase. And chefs around the world had already belted their praise over the ‘caviar of sweet onions’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I just started down a path, with no end goal or milestone set. I just started going. No angel investor. No VC backer. I just used some modest profit from my other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepsouthventures.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;domain name developments&lt;/a&gt; to fund the endeavor. This was Feb of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I began, I discovered there was a Vidalia Onion committee which represents all the Vidalia farmers. So I reached out to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were kind enough to listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They introduced me to 3 farmers in the Vidalia region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got along quite well with the 3rd farmer I met, so we decided to partner &amp;amp; give this a shot. They’d been around for 25 years; hadn’t focused on direct-to-consumer; but understood its value. They operated a packing shed as well. And most importantly, they grew an award winning Vidalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conservatively estimated fifty (50) orders for our 2015 season. We ended up with over six hundred (600).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the farm concentrated on the Vidalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, &amp;amp; logistics. I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we both focused on these efforts, the more we grew. So much so, that other Vidalia operations began shutting down their mail order efforts and simply directed folks our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began testing alternate marketing avenues – a billboard on I-95 just south of Savannah, GA facing northbound traffic; sponsoring a bike rider headed cross country for charity; sponsoring a high school basketball team, as well as a grade school auction fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added a phone order hotline, which – from time to time – generates more sales than online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made a few colossal mistakes, which were entirely of my doing, like blowing $10,000 on faulty shipping boxes from an ill-informed &amp;amp; misleading box manufacturer in Dalton, GA. (it happened early in our journey, and nearly forced me to shut down)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I refused to let something like that that kill this. Honestly, my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: ” THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE! ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes say I prefer projects that focus on purpose over profit. And as we enter our 5th season, this one continues to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m Peter Askew, and I sell onions on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;On January 3, 2018, Google Project Zero and others &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html&quot;&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; the first three of a new class of vulnerabilities that affect CPUs that perform speculative execution, dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf&quot;&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf&quot;&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution&quot;&gt;speculative execution&lt;/a&gt; mechanisms of CPUs, an attacker could temporarily bypass both implicit and explicit safety checks in code that prevent programs from reading unauthorized data in memory. While processor speculation was designed to be a microarchitectural detail, invisible at the architectural level, carefully crafted programs could read unauthorized information in speculation and disclose it through side channels such as the execution time of a program fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was shown that JavaScript could be used to mount Spectre attacks, the V8 team became involved in tackling the problem. We formed an emergency response team and worked closely with other teams at Google, our partners at other browser vendors, and our hardware partners. In concert with them, we proactively engaged in both offensive research (constructing proof-of-concept gadgets) and defensive research (mitigations for potential attacks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Spectre attack consists of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leak of otherwise-inaccessible data into hidden CPU state.&lt;/em&gt; All known Spectre attacks use speculation to leak bits of inaccessible data into CPU caches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extract the hidden state&lt;/em&gt; to recover the inaccessible data. For this, the attacker needs a clock of sufficient precision. (Surprisingly low-resolution clocks can be sufficient, especially with techniques such as edge thresholding.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, it would be sufficient to defeat either of the two components of an attack. Since we do not know of any way to defeat any of the parts perfectly, we designed and deployed mitigations that greatly reduce the amount of information that is leaked into CPU caches &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; mitigations that make it hard to recover the hidden state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;high-precision-timers&quot;&gt;High-precision timers &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/spectre#high-precision-timers&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tiny state changes that can survive speculative execution give rise to correspondingly tiny, almost impossibly tiny, timing differences — on the order of a billionth of a second. To directly detect individual such differences, an attacker program needs a high precision timer. CPUs offer such timers, but the Web Platform does not expose them. The Web Platform’s most precise timer, &lt;code&gt;performance.now()&lt;/code&gt;, had a resolution of single-digit micro-seconds, which was originally thought unusable for this purpose. Yet two years ago, an academic research team specializing in micro-architectural attacks published &lt;a href=&quot;https://gruss.cc/files/fantastictimers.pdf&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; that studied the availability of timers in the web platform. They concluded that concurrent mutable shared memory and various resolution-recovery techniques could allow the construction of even higher resolution timers, down to nanosecond resolution. Such timers are precise enough to detect individual L1 cache hits and misses, which is usually how Spectre gadgets leak information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;timer-mitigations&quot;&gt;Timer mitigations &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/spectre#timer-mitigations&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disrupt the ability to detect small timing differences, browser vendors took a multi-pronged approach. On all browsers, the resolution of &lt;code&gt;performance.now()&lt;/code&gt; was reduced (in Chrome, from 5 microseconds to 100), and random uniform jitter was introduced to prevent resolution recovery. After consultation among all the vendors, together we decided to take the unprecedented step of immediately and retroactively disabling the &lt;code&gt;SharedArrayBuffer&lt;/code&gt; API across all browsers in order to prevent the construction of a nanosecond timer that could be used for Spectre attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;amplification&quot;&gt;Amplification &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/spectre#amplification&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became clear early on in our offensive research that timer mitigations alone would not be sufficient. One reason why is that an attacker may simply repeatedly execute their gadget so that the cumulative time difference is much larger than a single cache hit or miss. We were able to engineer reliable gadgets that use many cache lines at a time, up to the cache capacity, yielding timing differences as large as 600 microseconds. We later discovered arbitrary amplification techniques that are not limited by the cache capacity. Such amplification techniques rely on multiple attempts to read the secret data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;jit-mitigations&quot;&gt;JIT mitigations &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/spectre#jit-mitigations&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read inaccessible data using Spectre, the attacker tricks the CPU into speculatively executing code that reads normally inaccessible data and encodes it into the cache. The attack can be broken in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevent speculative execution of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent speculative execution from reading inaccessible data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have experimented with (1) by inserting the recommended speculation barrier instructions, such as Intel’s &lt;code&gt;LFENCE&lt;/code&gt;, on every critical conditional branch, and by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7625886&quot;&gt;retpolines&lt;/a&gt; for indirect branches. Unfortunately, such heavy-handed mitigations greatly reduce performance (2–3× slowdown on the Octane benchmark). Instead, we chose approach (2), inserting mitigation sequences that prevent reading secret data due to mis-speculation. Let us illustrate the technique on the following code snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;condition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, let us assume condition is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. The code above is vulnerable if the CPU speculatively reads from &lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is out-of-bounds, accessing normalling inaccessible data. The important observation is that in such case, the speculation tries to read &lt;code&gt;a[i]&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;condition&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. Our mitigation rewrites this program so that it behaves exactly like the original program but does not leak any speculatively loaded data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reserve one CPU register which we call the poison to track whether code is executing in a mispredicted branch. The poison register is maintained across all branches and calls in generated code, so that any mispredicted branch causes the poison register to become &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. Then we instrument all memory accesses so that they unconditionally mask the result of all loads with the current value of the poison register. This does not prevent the processor from predicting (or mispredicting) branches, but destroys the information of (potentially out-of-bounds) loaded values due to mispredicted branches. The instrumented code is shown below (assuming that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a number array).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;mark class=&quot;highlight-line highlight-line-active&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; poison &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;condition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;mark class=&quot;highlight-line highlight-line-active&quot;&gt;  poison &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; condition&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;mark class=&quot;highlight-line highlight-line-active&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; poison&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional code does not have any effect on the normal (architecturally-defined) behavior of the program. It only affects micro-architectural state when running on speculating CPUs. If the program was instrumented at source level, advanced optimizations in modern compilers might remove such instrumentation. In V8, we prevent our compiler from removing the mitigations by inserting them in a very late phase of compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use the poisoning technique to prevent leaks from misspeculated indirect branches in the interpreter’s bytecode dispatch loop and in the JavaScript function call sequence. In the interpreter, we set the poison to 0 if the bytecode handler (i.e. the machine code sequence that interprets a single bytecode) does not match the current bytecode. For JavaScript calls, we pass the target function as a parameter (in a register) and we set the poison to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of each function if the incoming target function does not match the current function. With the poisoning mitigations in place, we see less than 20% slowdown on the Octane benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mitigations for WebAssembly are simpler, since the main safety check is to ensure memory accesses are within bounds. For 32-bit platforms, in addition to the normal bounds checks, we pad all memories to the next power of two and unconditionally mask off any upper bits of a user-supplied memory index. 64-bit platforms need no such mitigation, since the implementation uses virtual memory protection for bounds checks. We experimented with compiling switch/case statements to binary search code rather than using a potentially vulnerable indirect branch, but this is too expensive on some workloads. Indirect calls are protected with retpolines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-mitigations-are-an-unsustainable-path&quot;&gt;Software mitigations are an unsustainable path &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/spectre#software-mitigations-are-an-unsustainable-path&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately or unfortunately, our offensive research advanced much faster than our defensive research, and we quickly discovered that software mitigation of all possible leaks due to Spectre was infeasible. This was due to a variety of reasons. First, the engineering effort diverted to combating Spectre was disproportionate to its threat level. In V8 we face many other security threats that are much worse, from direct out-of-bound reads due to regular bugs (faster and more direct than Spectre), out-of-bound writes (impossible with Spectre, and worse) and potential remote code execution (impossible with Spectre and much, much worse). Second, the increasingly complicated mitigations that we designed and implemented carried significant complexity, which is technical debt and might actually increase the attack surface, and performance overheads. Third, testing and maintaining mitigations for microarchitectural leaks is even trickier than designing gadgets themselves, since it’s hard to be sure the mitigations continue working as designed. At least once, important mitigations were effectively undone by later compiler optimizations. Fourth, we found that effective mitigation of some variants of Spectre, particularly variant 4, to be simply infeasible in software, even after a heroic effort by our partners at Apple to combat the problem in their JIT compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;site-isolation&quot;&gt;Site isolation &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/spectre#site-isolation&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research reached the conclusion that, in principle, untrusted code can read a process’s entire address space using Spectre and side channels. Software mitigations reduce the effectiveness of many potential gadgets, but are not efficient or comprehensive. The only effective mitigation is to move sensitive data out of the process’s address space. Thankfully, Chrome already had an effort underway for many years to separate sites into different processes to reduce the attack surface due to conventional vulnerabilities. This investment paid off, and we productionized and deployed &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/site-isolation&quot;&gt;site isolation&lt;/a&gt; for as many platforms as possible by May 2018. Thus Chrome’s security model no longer assumes language-enforced confidentiality within a renderer process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectre has been a long journey and has highlighted the best in collaboration across vendors in the industry and academia. So far, white hats appear to be ahead of black hats. We still know of no attacks in the wild, outside of the curious tinkerers and professional researchers developing proof of concept gadgets. New variants of these vulnerabilities continue to trickle out, and may continue to do so for some time. We continue to track these threats and take them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many with a background in programming languages and their implementations, the idea that safe languages enforce a proper abstraction boundary, not allowing well-typed programs to read arbitrary memory, has been a guarantee upon which our mental models have been built. It is a depressing conclusion that our models were wrong — this guarantee is not true on today’s hardware. Of course, we still believe that safe languages have great engineering benefits and will continue to be the basis for the future, but… on today’s hardware they leak a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested readers can dig into more details in &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05178.pdf&quot;&gt;our whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Can&amp;#039;t Do Anything for Fun Anymore; Every Hobby Is an Attempt to Make Money</title>
<link>https://www.bennettnotes.com/post/making-money-out-of-every-hobby/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bennettnotes.com/post/making-money-out-of-every-hobby/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, it was easy to merrily invest myself in any activity that I found interesting. Building robots, learning to play guitar, and making short films were things that I would work on after school everyday. I did all those things simply because I &lt;em&gt;enjoyed&lt;/em&gt; doing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as a young adult, I feel like I completely lost that spontaneity and simple mindset. Every project which I take up has become an attempt to make money. I tell myself, “Oh wow, that’s a cool app idea, I should build it. But wait….how am I going to monetize it. Is it worth it?” I developed this hostile view of activities where everything is a calculated risk of how much time I need to put in versus what I am getting in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bennettnotes.com/img/time%20investment.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;time investment&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to do YouTube completely for fun, then I got serious and tried to turn it into a “business”. Guess what? I absolutely hate doing it now, even if it does bring me in a little extra cash each month. I rejected so many website ideas and app ideas just because I knew there was no way to make any profit from them. And if I try to start a new hobby or goal, my mind immediately puts the focus on money and profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about trying to write a book for awhile. Here’s my thought process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hmm…I want to write a book. I would really love to write a sappy romance novel because I think they’re so fun to write. But I need to turn it into profit, so I should do market research and see what’s trending and build off that. Self-help is big, let’s try to focus on that, even though I personally hate self-help books.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention that I am a software engineer who makes a decent salary, so it’s not like I absolutely &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; extra money. I try to rationalize my obsession by attributing all this to my goal of working for myself and wanting to start my own business. But still, it sucks that I can’t find the strength to take on a hobby simply because I enjoy it. I envy my friends who start new things out of pure love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So Kevin you started doing aikido?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah Dave, I absolutely love it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But how are you making money out of it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-6594501022141871&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6999463098&quot;/&gt;

<title>Inside Erlang – Joe Armstrong tells his story (2014)</title>
<link>https://wcm.ericsson.net/en/news/2014/12/inside-erlang--creator-joe-armstrong-tells-his-story</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wcm.ericsson.net/en/news/2014/12/inside-erlang--creator-joe-armstrong-tells-his-story</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;eG1Col preamble&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang is a programming language designed by Ericsson and used by a number of companies such as WhatsApp, Amazon and Facebook. We had the chance to talk to its creator Joe Armstrong about its development and enduring popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;eG2-3Col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mainbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Armstrong was a long-time employee of Ericsson. He joined the company in 1985 and within a year had developed an early version of Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;block videoblock&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/VideoObject&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;videoplayer js-videoplayer&quot; data-videodisplaymode=&quot;inarticle&quot; data-videodata=&quot;{&amp;quot;ExtraData&amp;quot;:{},&amp;quot;VideoProvider&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;kaltura&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;PartnerId&amp;quot;:1614541,&amp;quot;UiConfId&amp;quot;:32121831,&amp;quot;EntryId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;1_s18bs9bx&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;AdditionalScriptUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;//cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1614541/sp/161454100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/32121831/partner_id/1614541&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;VideoFileUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;//www.kaltura.com/p/1614541/sp/0/playManifest/entryId/1_s18bs9bx/format/applehttp/protocol/http/flavorParamId/32121831/video.mp4&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;YoutubeUrl&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;YoutubeID&amp;quot;:null}&quot; data-videoservice=&quot;kaltura&quot; data-additionalscript=&quot;//cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1614541/sp/161454100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/32121831/partner_id/1614541&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;videoplayer-launchplayer js-launchvideoplayer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wcm.ericsson.net/assets/global/scaled/erlang-video-startpage-91469resize1500845crop001500844autoorientquality90stripbackground23ffffffextensionjpgid8_970x546_90_361895.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armstrong designed Erlang with the aim of improving the development of telephony applications by creating a language better tailored to its needs. The initial version of Erlang was influenced by the programming language PLEX – used in earlier Ericsson exchanges – and was implemented in Prolog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;PLEX had come to the end of its useful life,&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;It was a language that was created in 1976. For its time, it was brilliant but things had happened in computer science that had invalidated PLEX and better ways of programming were being discovered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the coming years a small team of Ericsson researchers, including Robert Virding and Mike Williams, helped Armstrong further develop and improve the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We wanted to tailor a program language for telecom systems and the results became this programming language that we now know as Erlang,&quot; Armstrong said. &quot;Eventually, hundreds of thousands of people would begin using it but that wasn’t our aim initially. We simply wanted to create something to replace PLEX to program the AXE system.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Armstrong, the language went from lab product to real applications following the collapse of the next-generation AXE-N exchange in 1995. As a result, Erlang was chosen for the next ATM exchange, AXD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally a proprietary language within Ericsson, Erlang was eventually released as open source in 1998. Since then Erlang has been adopted by companies worldwide, including Nortel and T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
