<title>Is Hacker News Bullshit?</title>

<description>&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-750-1125&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff405ee6c-7b7e-4e53-bc9c-ca8a51b14b44_1125x750.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff405ee6c-7b7e-4e53-bc9c-ca8a51b14b44_1125x750.jpeg&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f405ee6c-7b7e-4e53-bc9c-ca8a51b14b44_1125x750.jpeg&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:750,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:1125,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;High-Angle Photo of Robot&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;High-Angle Photo of Robot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean when a computer can write about our problems better than we can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been talking a lot about GPT-3, but more as a novelty than a tool (don’t know what GPT-3 is? look &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Some clever &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304?s=20&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; have even figured out how to get it to generate code from descriptions. Yet, I think that the best use cases lie outside of tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that GPT-3 has the potential to change the way we write. But I can’t just tell that to people, most of them won’t believe it. People need at least some proof before they begin to take these things seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two weeks, I’ve been promoting a blog written by GPT-3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would write the title and introduction, add a photo, and let GPT-3 do the rest. The blog has had over 26 thousand visitors, and we now have about 60 loyal subscribers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And only &lt;strong&gt;ONE PERSON&lt;/strong&gt; has noticed it was written by GPT-3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People talk about how GPT-3 often writes incoherently and irrationally. But, that doesn’t keep people from reading it… and liking it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the very first &lt;a href=&quot;https://adolos.substack.com/p/feeling-unproductive-maybe-you-should&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; made it to the &lt;strong&gt;number one spot&lt;/strong&gt; on Hacker News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-584-744&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F224a8ae9-6dcb-4b68-971a-9ac36932e6a1_744x584.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F224a8ae9-6dcb-4b68-971a-9ac36932e6a1_744x584.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/224a8ae9-6dcb-4b68-971a-9ac36932e6a1_744x584.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:584,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:744,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manuel Araoz had done something similar with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, but his approach was different. People were surprised when he revealed the text was written by GPT-3. It was his revealing that made the article interesting, otherwise, it’s just a crappy piece of writing (what GPT-3 wrote, the rest is quite good).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, not only did people not realize they were reading generated text, but they enjoyed the writing so much that they voted it above dozens of other human-written articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must confess, I actually lied earlier when I told you only one person noticed. Only one person reached out to me to ask if GPT-3 was writing the articles. However, there were a few commenters on hacker news who also guessed it. Funny enough, nobody took notice because the community &lt;strong&gt;downvoted the comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;image-link image2 image2-227-664&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc27029e9-2ff7-497b-b0a8-498769f01db0_664x227.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc27029e9-2ff7-497b-b0a8-498769f01db0_664x227.png&quot; data-attrs=&quot;{&amp;quot;src&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c27029e9-2ff7-497b-b0a8-498769f01db0_664x227.png&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:227,&amp;quot;width&amp;quot;:664,&amp;quot;resizeWidth&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;bytes&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:null,&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;:null}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a little bad considering that it really was written by GPT-3, but it’s still pretty funny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I think this is enough to prove that the concept works. So, what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future of online media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit of GPT-3 is efficiency. All I need to write is a good title and intro. I could write five of them in an hour and publish them all in one day if I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, one good writer with GPT-3 can now do the same work that took a team of content creators before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read some of the content I made, you may not be convinced about its quality. Indeed, there are traces of illogic, difficulty with staying on topic, issues with repetition, etc. I chose to leave the content as unedited as possible [1] for the purposes of this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with very minor editing, you could make these decent. Cut out irrelevant stuff, write a conclusion, and boom - people don't stand a chance of telling the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean for online content going forward? Well, I’m not entirely sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For facts based content producers, you’re (probably) safe. There’s a reason I chose a self-help style theme for the blog. GPT-3 is great at creating beautiful language that touches emotion, not hard logic and rational thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think the real value here is not in blog posts, that was just to prove the concept. Its true value lies as a writing tool. The invention of GPT-3 for writers is like the invention of the McCormick reaper for farmers. It increases efficiency, and thus reduces labor costs, like any other technological innovation. The difference is, this is one of the first times technology has the potential to affect jobs in the creative sector.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For big media companies, this could mean huge savings. Again, for fact-based reporting you won’t be able to just let GPT-3 write the thing for you. As a supplementary tool, however, I think it could certainly speed up the process, saving them quite a bit of cash. Let’s do some napkin math, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buzzfeed Inc. has 1700 employees with an average base salary for a writer being 42k USD according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/BuzzFeed-Writer-Salaries-E496875_D_KO9,15.htm&quot;&gt;glassdoor&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know how many of those employees are writers (if you do, message me), but I’m going to guess it’s a few hundred. For our purposes, let's say 400 writers. As another simplification, let’s assume annual revenue is tied to the number of articles produced (i.e. as long as the number of articles produced stays the same, annual revenue should also remain the same). let's say for the kind of content on this website, GPT-3 can only increase efficiency by 50% (keep in mind for self-help style writing, speedup was over 5x for me, but I’ve also never worked in media, so I’m being conservative). Remaining even more conservative, let's say that only &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of the writers at Buzzfeed can benefit from these efficiency gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would mean that ~133 writers with GPT-3 can produce the same amount of content as 200 writers without it. If we viewed this in terms of labor costs, replacing the 200 person team with a 133 person, GPT-3 supported team would save Buzzfeed about&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 million dollars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, unless GPT-3 ends up being a total flop for content production, I think this number could be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don’t think Buzzfeed is going to start making their writers use GPT-3. I think their staff will be too resistant to it. They may be offended at the suggestion that a computer can write better than they can, or it cramps their style. But, given how much these companies are struggling during COVID, who knows what they’ll do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves room for a new kind of media company. One that’s fast and lean. The writing team will be small, but experts at bending GPT-3 to their will. It’s a 2006 Chevy Suburban vs a 2020 Tesla. You can't mod your suburban into a Tesla, they’re completely different models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun doing this experiment. Some people will probably get mad at me for tricking people, but whatever. The whole point of releasing this in private beta is so the community can show OpenAI new use cases that they should either encourage or look out for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh also, I don’t actually have access to GPT-3. I had to find a PhD student who was kind enough to help me out, but not so kind as to give me the API keys outright. So I’ve been having to send him prompts and adjust parameters manually over messages…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, if you’re reading this, can I please get access to GPT-3 so I can leave this poor PhD student alone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you’re curious, &lt;a href=&quot;https://adolos.substack.com/p/what-i-would-do-with-gpt-3-if-i-had&quot;&gt;here is how I revealed the joke to my subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] There were, on occasion, small changes that had to be changed or would have been dead giveaways. For instance, it once attributed a Bob Dylan quote to Emerson. There were also some simple grammatical errors. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Latest Firefox rolls out Enhanced Tracking Protection 2.0</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/04/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection-2-0-blocking-redirect-trackers-by-default/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/04/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection-2-0-blocking-redirect-trackers-by-default/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Firefox is introducing Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) 2.0, our next step in continuing to provide a safe and private experience for our users. ETP 2.0 protects you from an advanced tracking technique called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Privacy/Redirect_Tracking_Protection#Redirect_tracking_defined&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;redirect tracking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;em&gt;bounce tracking&lt;/em&gt;. We will be rolling out ETP 2.0 over the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year we &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/06/04/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/&quot;&gt;enabled&lt;/a&gt; ETP by default in Firefox because &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/09/05/why-we-need-better-tracking-protection/&quot;&gt;we believe&lt;/a&gt; that understanding the complexities and sophistication of the ad tracking industry should not be required to be safe online. ETP 1.0 was our first major step in fulfilling that commitment to users. Since we enabled ETP by default, we’ve blocked 3.4 trillion tracking cookies. With ETP 2.0, Firefox brings an additional level of privacy protection to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of ETP, ad industry technology has found other ways to track users: creating workarounds and new ways to collect your data in order to identify you as you browse the web. Redirect tracking goes around Firefox’s built-in third-party cookie-blocking policy by passing you through the tracker’s site &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; landing on your desired website. This enables them to see where you came from and where you are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firefox deletes tracking cookies every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ETP 2.0, Firefox users will now be protected against these methods as it checks to see if cookies and site data from those trackers need to be deleted every day. ETP 2.0 stops known trackers from having access to your information, even those with which you may have inadvertently visited. ETP 2.0 clears cookies and site data from tracking sites every 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes trackers do more than just track. They may also offer services you engage with, such as a search engine or social network. If Firefox cleared cookies for these services we’d end up logging you out of your email or social network every day, so we don’t clear cookies from sites you have interacted with in the past 45 days, even if they are trackers. This way you don’t lose the benefits of the cookies that keep you logged in on sites you frequent, and you don’t open yourself up to being tracked indefinitely based on a site you’ve visited once. To read the technical details about how this works, visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/08/04/firefox-79-includes-protections-against-redirect-tracking/&quot;&gt;Security Blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean for you? You can simply continue to browse the web with Firefox. We are doing more to protect your privacy, automatically. Without needing to change a setting or preference, this new protection deletes cookies that use workarounds to track you so you can rest easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out and download the latest version of Firefox available &lt;a href=&quot;http://mozilla.org/firefox/new&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook launches its TikTok rival, Instagram Reels</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/facebook-launches-its-tiktok-rival-instagram-reels-56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/facebook-launches-its-tiktok-rival-instagram-reels-56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook-owned Instagram on Wednesday launched its answer to the popular karaoke app TikTok, &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;whose future remains in limbo&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/trump-tiktok-treasury-demand-microsoft-sale-559acca3-45da-40ea-acbe-26aef7c8c0b0.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Facebook launches its TikTok rival, Instagram Reels&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/trump-tiktok-treasury-demand-microsoft-sale-559acca3-45da-40ea-acbe-26aef7c8c0b0.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;whose future remains in limbo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook has a long record — sometimes successful, sometimes not — of adopting features that have proven popular on rival platforms and rolling them out to its billions of users worldwide in an effort to avoid being eclipsed by younger upstarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving the news:&lt;/strong&gt; Reels enters the fray as TikTok, threatened with a ban by President Trump because of its Chinese ownership, has &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;opened negotiations&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-8f544ed3-bd7b-4b11-8d2a-6286f107242f.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Facebook launches its TikTok rival, Instagram Reels&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-8f544ed3-bd7b-4b11-8d2a-6286f107242f.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;opened negotiations&lt;/a&gt; to be acquired by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A world where Reels must compete with a Microsoft-owned TikTok will present a very different challenge to Facebook than a world in which TikTok has been shut down in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be smart:&lt;/strong&gt; Reels is the first product Instagram has created that focuses more on creators than everyday users. Reels' video distribution algorithm will resemble TikTok's: users will see the most popular videos at the moment, rather than a selection tailored to their individual profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; The new product will be embedded within Instagram, so that the app's 1 billion+ user base can tap into it and help it achieve wide adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The product will debut in over 50 countries&lt;/strong&gt; on Wednesday, including the U.S., India, Brazil, France, Germany, the U.K., Japan, Australia and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It will allow users to create 15-second videos&lt;/strong&gt; using editing tools that are embedded in Instagram's camera, like a countdown clock, a timer and a new align tool, which gives users an easy way to string together different video cuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It will include music from a big library&lt;/strong&gt; of titles that Instagram has recently &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;licensed&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/facebook-is-set-to-finally-get-the-rights-to-show-music-videos&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Facebook launches its TikTok rival, Instagram Reels&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/facebook-is-set-to-finally-get-the-rights-to-show-music-videos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt; from music labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reels differs from TikTok&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to Instagram's augmented reality effects, which let users overlay images and filters onto their videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Reels gives Instagram an opportunity to tap into a new creative community, one that's more focused on talent than the beauty-and-aesthetics topics that dominate Instagram today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;We've not been historically good at helping new creators find an audience,&quot; said Vishal Shah, Instagram's VP of product, on a call with reporters Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;The pitch for new creators is that Reels is a good way to get discovered, even if you don't have a follower base.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What creators like about TikTok&lt;/strong&gt; is that they can amass huge audiences quickly if their video gains traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instagram says creators will be able to share Reels videos privately with their friends and followers via direct messages or on their Stories, but they also now have the opportunity to be discovered by Instagram's massive audience within its Explore tab if they wish to do so and if their accounts are set to public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reels videos will live in a dedicated space within the Explore tab called the Stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because Instagram doesn't have a &quot;share&quot; button, it's been hard for content on Instagram to go viral to lots of people fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be smart:&lt;/strong&gt; Instagram had previously launched a Reels-like product called Lasso, that it later shut down. Executives told reporters on a call Wednesday that it's hard to get a new app to reach mass adoption — hence the reason for making Reels a feature within Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; Executives acknowledged that the launch of Reels is timely, given TikTok's future in the U.S. &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot; is on the brink&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/tiktok-crackdown-us-playing-by-chinas-internet-rules-379bf293-fd24-44af-93af-319c850f6500.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Facebook launches its TikTok rival, Instagram Reels&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/tiktok-crackdown-us-playing-by-chinas-internet-rules-379bf293-fd24-44af-93af-319c850f6500.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;is on the brink&lt;/a&gt;, but they say they did not expedite the launch to take advantage of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;This has always been part of our plan,&quot; said Shah. &quot;We've been working on this for over a year.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The timing, he says, &quot;happens to be coincidental&quot; but it's also a reflection of an acceleration of what users increasingly say they want to do on Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;There is a lot of appetite for short-form, edited video on instagram,&quot; said Shah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;We started to experiment over a year ago in Brazil with Reels. In last month, 45% of videos uploaded to the (Instagram) feed were 15 seconds or less,&quot; he said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, but:&lt;/strong&gt; Instagram is coming somewhat late to the game. Already, &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;several apps like Byte, Dubsmash and Triller&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/tiktok-ban-byte-snap-a59d4a81-5f6d-4e14-a839-966114dd822e.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Facebook launches its TikTok rival, Instagram Reels&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/tiktok-ban-byte-snap-a59d4a81-5f6d-4e14-a839-966114dd822e.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;several apps like Byte, Dubsmash and Triller&lt;/a&gt; are trying to win over TikTok users with similar products. And one of Instagram's biggest rivals, Snapchat, is &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;reportedly testing&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/snapchat-tests-tiktok-style-navigation-for-exploring-public-content/&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;56460094-88df-4aa5-b6a1-39695c682508&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Facebook launches its TikTok rival, Instagram Reels&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/snapchat-tests-tiktok-style-navigation-for-exploring-public-content/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reportedly testing&lt;/a&gt; TikTok-style design for exploring content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's next:&lt;/strong&gt; For now, Instagram is focusing on rolling Reels out and getting users to adopt it. Executives say it's not focused on how it will make money with Reels quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;We're experimenting with different monetization options (for creators),&quot; said Shah, referencing different Instagram products like Instagram shopping, and IGTV. &quot;These are early and we are still testing them.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Chat Bubble Blindness</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How removing our live chat bubble led to more conversations.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;48.192911098199&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;43.909718056389&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month we removed our live chat bubble and replaced it with a link to live chat in our navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It led to a &lt;em&gt;62% increase&lt;/em&gt; in new chat conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Chat bubble vs navigation link.&quot; title=&quot;Chat bubble vs navigation link.&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/static/f8dc6561706434adfa7ec73682dfb560/8e1fc/comparison2.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/f8dc6561706434adfa7ec73682dfb560/863e1/comparison2.jpg 225w, /static/f8dc6561706434adfa7ec73682dfb560/20e5d/comparison2.jpg 450w, /static/f8dc6561706434adfa7ec73682dfb560/8e1fc/comparison2.jpg 900w, /static/f8dc6561706434adfa7ec73682dfb560/b768e/comparison2.jpg 1350w, /static/f8dc6561706434adfa7ec73682dfb560/d165a/comparison2.jpg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may not be universally applicable but it's what happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Startup &quot;Thing To Do&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first added Intercom when we launched Atlist— it just seemed like the startup &lt;em&gt;thing to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we immediately found the Intercom chat bubble annoying— it would clutter up our interface and even obstruct elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;The chat bubble would obstruct our interface.&quot; title=&quot;The chat bubble would obstruct our interface.&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/static/4459a9264868586915665e5760116e40/1cfc2/obstruct2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/4459a9264868586915665e5760116e40/3684f/obstruct2.png 225w, /static/4459a9264868586915665e5760116e40/fc2a6/obstruct2.png 450w, /static/4459a9264868586915665e5760116e40/1cfc2/obstruct2.png 900w, /static/4459a9264868586915665e5760116e40/21482/obstruct2.png 1350w, /static/4459a9264868586915665e5760116e40/d61c2/obstruct2.png 1800w, /static/4459a9264868586915665e5760116e40/e8950/obstruct2.png 2000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found ourself designing &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the chat bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a moment of desperation we created a &quot;hide chat bubble&quot; option in our settings— that way we could at least hide it for ourselves and stop being annoyed by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;We created an option to hide the chat bubble.&quot; title=&quot;We created an option to hide the chat bubble.&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/static/852bc20cab20783b20fade72e9161d60/1cfc2/hide.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/852bc20cab20783b20fade72e9161d60/3684f/hide.png 225w, /static/852bc20cab20783b20fade72e9161d60/fc2a6/hide.png 450w, /static/852bc20cab20783b20fade72e9161d60/1cfc2/hide.png 900w, /static/852bc20cab20783b20fade72e9161d60/21482/hide.png 1350w, /static/852bc20cab20783b20fade72e9161d60/d61c2/hide.png 1800w, /static/852bc20cab20783b20fade72e9161d60/a30c9/hide.png 2614w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &quot;hide chat bubble&quot; option never felt satisfying. We knew hadn't solved the problem— we had just hid it from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to do a test. We removed the Intercom chat bubble...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Old&quot; title=&quot;Old&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/static/e7ad0599a1231dfe6ab2e18c6f65a7fc/1cfc2/chat-bubble-old2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/e7ad0599a1231dfe6ab2e18c6f65a7fc/3684f/chat-bubble-old2.png 225w, /static/e7ad0599a1231dfe6ab2e18c6f65a7fc/fc2a6/chat-bubble-old2.png 450w, /static/e7ad0599a1231dfe6ab2e18c6f65a7fc/1cfc2/chat-bubble-old2.png 900w, /static/e7ad0599a1231dfe6ab2e18c6f65a7fc/21482/chat-bubble-old2.png 1350w, /static/e7ad0599a1231dfe6ab2e18c6f65a7fc/d61c2/chat-bubble-old2.png 1800w, /static/e7ad0599a1231dfe6ab2e18c6f65a7fc/f581c/chat-bubble-old2.png 3072w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and replaced it with a link to live chat in our navigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;New&quot; title=&quot;New&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/static/d70823509dbabc54c070c928121a2cc2/1cfc2/chat-bubble-new2.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/d70823509dbabc54c070c928121a2cc2/3684f/chat-bubble-new2.png 225w, /static/d70823509dbabc54c070c928121a2cc2/fc2a6/chat-bubble-new2.png 450w, /static/d70823509dbabc54c070c928121a2cc2/1cfc2/chat-bubble-new2.png 900w, /static/d70823509dbabc54c070c928121a2cc2/21482/chat-bubble-new2.png 1350w, /static/d70823509dbabc54c070c928121a2cc2/d61c2/chat-bubble-new2.png 1800w, /static/d70823509dbabc54c070c928121a2cc2/b6d22/chat-bubble-new2.png 2986w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users had the option to begin a live chat once they clicked the navigation link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Live chat&quot; title=&quot;Live chat&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/static/bbf82fa80b982d5fef29ac26257256e5/1cfc2/start-chat.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/bbf82fa80b982d5fef29ac26257256e5/3684f/start-chat.png 225w, /static/bbf82fa80b982d5fef29ac26257256e5/fc2a6/start-chat.png 450w, /static/bbf82fa80b982d5fef29ac26257256e5/1cfc2/start-chat.png 900w, /static/bbf82fa80b982d5fef29ac26257256e5/21482/start-chat.png 1350w, /static/bbf82fa80b982d5fef29ac26257256e5/d61c2/start-chat.png 1800w, /static/bbf82fa80b982d5fef29ac26257256e5/39148/start-chat.png 2876w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The navigation link &lt;strong&gt;led to a &lt;em&gt;62% increase&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in live chat conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the numbers from the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-image&quot; alt=&quot;Results&quot; title=&quot;Results&quot; src=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/static/d6638638a5cc6b8a91e6e9585d78c3ef/1cfc2/results.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/static/d6638638a5cc6b8a91e6e9585d78c3ef/3684f/results.png 225w, /static/d6638638a5cc6b8a91e6e9585d78c3ef/fc2a6/results.png 450w, /static/d6638638a5cc6b8a91e6e9585d78c3ef/1cfc2/results.png 900w, /static/d6638638a5cc6b8a91e6e9585d78c3ef/21482/results.png 1350w, /static/d6638638a5cc6b8a91e6e9585d78c3ef/a6ec4/results.png 1438w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chat Bubble Blindness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This felt like a win— I like live chat but I hate chat bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I hate them, maybe users hate them too? Maybe users have developed a chat bubble blindness— just like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/&quot;&gt;banner ad blindness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, don't expect to see a chat bubble on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/&quot;&gt;Atlist&lt;/a&gt; ever again. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8.6184210526316&quot;&gt;Karl and I are building &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlistmaps.com/?c=chat_bubble_blog&quot;&gt;Atlist&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that makes it easy to build custom Google Maps.

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Owner insisted on 0 downtime. Moved the server 700 feet on a cart with 2 UPSs and a chain of (3)gigabit switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Should have been a 5 minute job if done correctly. Owner ended up paying for over 10 hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;One of my clients bought a new office space in the same complex and wanted their 1 virtual host server(7 Windows VMs) moved to the new &quot;server room&quot;. At first, I thought, &quot;Awesome! This will be quick. I'll just shut everything down, remove, number, and pack the drives, move everything, and set it all back up. Couple hours tops.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;(Yesterday)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Nope... I started going over my plan with the owner and he stops me at the first step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_28lDeogZhLGXvE95QRPeDL&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Owner: Wait, we can't shut anything down. We have customers accessing that server all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Me: You didn't notify them of scheduled maintenance like we discussed on Friday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;O: No, we can't have any downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;M: There is going to be downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;O: If there is, I'm not paying you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;M: Ok, there is a way I can do it but it will be about 5 minutes of downtime. We can set up a new virtual host at the new location and migrate through a temporary VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;O: Absolutely not! No downtime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;M: Ok, bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A few hours later, a friend of mine calls me up and says, &quot;Hey, I have this client that needs a server moved. He says he usually has you do his IT but you refused this time?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I tell him the story and we agree on a plan that will move the server and get both of us paid well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;(Today)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;I met up with my friend at the office and we got to work. From closet to &quot;server room&quot; is around 700 feet so we got 3 lengths of cat6 and 3 switches. We plugged the switches into our trucks in the parking lot and connected them with the cat6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;After the necessary DNS updates for the external services and the successful setup of the new firewall, we set up 2 of the NICs on the server as failover and plugged in a cat6 from the parking lot. After unplugging the original cat6 and a few minutes of testing and we confirmed not downtime yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Next, we unplugged 1 of the 2 power supplies and plugged it into a rackmount UPSs that was on the cart. Again, no downtime yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;We then unplugged the other power supply and, extremely carefully, moved the running server to the cart. We plugged the other power supply into a second rackmount UPS also on the cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Then began the fun part. Just over 2 hours to, very carefully, push the server to the new office space. On the way, changing the NIC failover at each switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;At the new office space, we successfully mounted everything back up. Tested for a while and confirmed 0 downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Friend charged the client for 4.5 hours of work, 2 hours of consultancy, and 4.5 hours of consultant help(Me).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Changes to SameSite Cookie Behavior – A Call to Action for Web Developers</title>
<link>https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/changes-to-samesite-cookie-behavior/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/changes-to-samesite-cookie-behavior/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We are changing the default value of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute for cookies from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This will greatly improve security for users. However, some web sites may depend (even unknowingly) on the old default, potentially resulting in breakage for those sites. At Mozilla, we are slowly introducing this change. And we are strongly encouraging all web developers to test their sites with the new default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SameSite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an attribute on cookies that allows web developers to declare that a cookie should be restricted to a first-party, or same-site, context. The attribute can have any of the following values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – The browser will send cookies with both cross-site and same-site requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Strict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – The browser will only send cookies for same-site requests (i.e., requests originating from the site that set the cookie).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Cookies will be withheld on cross-site requests (such as calls to load images or frames). However, cookies will be sent when a user navigates to the URL from an external site; for example, by following a link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the absence of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute implies that cookies will be attached to any request for a given origin, no matter who initiated that request. This behavior is equivalent to setting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite=None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. However, this “open by default” behavior leaves users vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF&quot;&gt;CSRF&lt;/a&gt;) attacks. In a CSRF attack, a malicious site attempts to use valid cookies from legitimate sites to carry out attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making the Web Safer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect users from CSRF attacks, browsers need to change the way cookies are handled. The two primary changes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When not specified, cookies will be treated as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite=Lax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies that explicitly set &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite=None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in order to enable cross-site delivery must also set the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Secure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute. (In other words, they must require HTTPS.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web sites that depend on the old default behavior must now explicitly set the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, they are required to include the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Secure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute. Once this change is made inside of Firefox, if web sites fail to set &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; correctly, it is possible those sites could break for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introducing the Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; behavior has been the default in Firefox Nightly since Nightly 75 (February 2020). At Mozilla, we’ve been able to explore the implications of this change. Starting with Firefox 79 (June 2020), we rolled it out to 50% of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/80.0beta/releasenotes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Firefox Beta&lt;/a&gt; user base. We want to monitor the scope of any potential breakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no timeline to ship this feature to the release channel of Firefox. We want to see that the Beta population is not seeing an unacceptable amount of site breakage—indicating most sites have adapted to the new default behavior. Since there is no exact definition of “breakage” and it can be difficult to determine via telemetry, we are watching for reports of site breakage in several channels (e.g. Bugzilla, social media, blogs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’d like to see the proposal advance further in the IETF. As proponents of the open web, it is important that changes to the web ecosystem are properly standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industry Coordination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an industry-wide change for browsers and is not something Mozilla is undertaking alone. Google has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rolling this change out&lt;/a&gt; to Chrome users since February 2020, with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite=Lax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; being the default for a certain (unpublished) percentage of all their channels (release, beta, canary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is cooperating with Google to track and share reports of website breakage in our respective bug tracking databases. Together, we are encouraging all web developers to start explicitly setting the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute as a best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Call to Action for Web Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing in the Firefox Nightly and Beta channels has shown that website breakage does occur. While we have reached out to those sites we’ve encountered and encouraged them to set the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute on their web properties, the web is clearly too big to do this on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that all web developers test their sites against this new default. This will prepare you for when both Firefox and Chrome browsers make the switch in their respective release channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test your site in Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test in Firefox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable the new default behavior (works in any version past 75):
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the URL bar, navigate to &lt;strong&gt;about:config&lt;/strong&gt;. (accept the warning prompt, if shown).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type &lt;strong&gt;SameSite&lt;/strong&gt; into the “Search Preference Name” bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; using the toggle icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;network.cookie.sameSite.noneRequiresSecure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt; using the toggle icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart Firefox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify the browser is using the new SameSite default behavior:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://samesite-sandbox.glitch.me/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://samesite-sandbox.glitch.me/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that all rows are green.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, test your site thoroughly. In particular, pay attention to anything involving login flows, multiple domains, or cross-site embedded content (images, videos, etc.). For any flows involving &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requests, you should test with and without a long delay. This is because both Firefox and Chrome implement a two-minute threshold that permits newly created cookies without the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute to be sent on top-level, cross-site &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; requests (a common login flow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Check your site for breakage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if your site is impacted by the new cookie behavior, examine the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console&quot;&gt;Firefox Web Console&lt;/a&gt; and look for either of these messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cookie rejected because it has the “&lt;code&gt;sameSite=none&lt;/code&gt;” attribute but is missing the “&lt;code&gt;secure&lt;/code&gt;” attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookie has “&lt;code&gt;sameSite&lt;/code&gt;” policy set to “&lt;code&gt;lax&lt;/code&gt;” because it is missing a “&lt;code&gt;sameSite&lt;/code&gt;” attribute, and “&lt;code&gt;sameSite=lax&lt;/code&gt;” is the default value for this attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing either of these messages does not necessarily mean your site will no longer work, as the new cookie behavior may not be important to your site’s functionality. It is critical, therefore, that each site test under the new conditions. Then, verify that the new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; behavior does not break anything. As a general rule, explicitly setting the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;SameSite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; attribute for cookies is the best way to guarantee that your site continues to function predictably.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to speed up the Rust compiler some more in 2020</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/08/05/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-some-more-in-2020/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/08/05/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-some-more-in-2020/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I last wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2020/04/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2020/&quot;&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; about my work on speeding up the Rust compiler. Time for another update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Weekly performance triage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is a process change: I have started doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/triage&quot;&gt;weekly performance triage&lt;/a&gt;. Each Tuesday I have been looking at the performance results of all the PRs merged in the past week. For each PR that has regressed or improved performance by a non-negligible amount, I add a comment to the PR with a link to the measurements. I also gather these results into a weekly report, which is mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://this-week-in-rust.org/&quot;&gt;This Week in Rust&lt;/a&gt;, and also looked at in the weekly compiler team meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this is to ensure that regressions are caught quickly and appropriate action is taken, and to raise awareness of performance issues in general. It takes me about 45 minutes each time. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/README.md&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; are written in such a way that anyone can do it, though it will take a bit of practice for newcomers to become comfortable with the process. I have started sharing the task around, with Mark Rousskov doing the most recent triage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process change was inspired by the “Regressions prevented” section of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nikic.github.io/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html&quot;&gt;an excellent blost post&lt;/a&gt; from Nikita Popov (a.k.a. nikic), about the work they have been doing to improve the speed of LLVM. (The process also takes some ideas from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/NightlyCrashTriage&quot;&gt;Firefox Nightly crash triage&lt;/a&gt; that I set up a few years ago when I was leading &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Uptime&quot;&gt;Project Uptime&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of LLVM directly impacts the speed of rustc, because rustc uses LLVM for its backend. This is a big deal in practice. The upgrade to LLVM 10 caused some &lt;a href=&quot;https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=f8d394e5184fe3af761ea1e5ba73f993cfb36dfe&amp;amp;end=93ec316bb464f33f99c1f71b1b239b9bb05cd1cb&quot;&gt;significant performance regressions for rustc&lt;/a&gt;, though enough other performance improvements landed around the same time that the relevant rustc release was still faster overall. However, thanks to nikic’s work, the upgrade to LLVM 11 will &lt;a href=&quot;https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7e11379f3b4c376fbb9a6c4d44f3286ccc28d149&amp;amp;end=adff1be71c9e1b3abb95b761d9caa41e4e1b9096&quot;&gt;win back&lt;/a&gt; much of the performance lost in the upgrade to LLVM 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that LLVM performance perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/g/llvm-dev/c/zox3VjzQ9JQ/m/vjqOSwDICgAJ&quot;&gt;hasn’t received that much attention&lt;/a&gt; in the past, so I am pleased to see this new focus. Methodical performance work takes a lot of time and effort, and can’t effectively be done by a single person over the long-term. I strongly encourage those working on LLVM to make this a team effort, and anyone with the relevant skills and/or interest to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better benchmarking and profiling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have also been some major improvements to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/&quot;&gt;rustc-perf&lt;/a&gt;, the performance suite and harness that drives &lt;a href=&quot;https://perf.rust-lang.org/&quot;&gt;perf.rust-lang.org&lt;/a&gt;, and which is also used for local benchmarking and profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/683&quot;&gt;#683&lt;/a&gt;: The command-line interface for the local benchmarking and profiling commands was ugly and confusing, so much so that one person mentioned on Zulip that they tried and failed to use them. We &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want people to be doing local benchmarking and profiling, so I filed this issue and then implemented PRs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/685&quot;&gt;#685&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/687&quot;&gt;#687&lt;/a&gt; to fix it. To give you an idea of the improvement, the following shows the minimal commands to benchmark the entire suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# Old
target/release/collector --db &amp;lt;DB&amp;gt; bench_local --rustc &amp;lt;RUSTC&amp;gt; --cargo &amp;lt;CARGO&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;
# New
target/release/collector bench_local &amp;lt;RUSTC&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full usage instructions are available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/README.md&quot;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/675&quot;&gt;#675&lt;/a&gt;: Joshua Nelson added support for benchmarking rustdoc. This is good because rustdoc performance has received little attention in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/699/&quot;&gt;#699&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/702&quot;&gt;#702&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/727&quot;&gt;#727&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/730/&quot;&gt;#730&lt;/a&gt;: These PRs added some proper CI testing for the local benchmarking and profiling commands, which had a history of being unintentionally broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Rousskov also made many small improvements to rustc-perf, including reducing the time it takes to run the suite, and improving the presentation of status information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;cargo-llvm-lines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2019/10/11/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-some-more-in-2019/&quot;&gt;inlining and code bloat&lt;/a&gt;, and how they can have a major effect on compile times. I mentioned that tooling to measure code size would be helpful. So I was happy to learn about the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines/&quot;&gt;cargo-llvm-lines&lt;/a&gt;, which measures how many lines of LLVM IR generated for each function. The results can be surprising, because generic functions (especially commons ones like &lt;code&gt;Vec::push()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Option::map()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Result::map_err()&lt;/code&gt;) can be instantiated dozens or even hundreds of times in a single crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on multiple PRs involving cargo-llvm-lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines/pull/15&quot;&gt;#15&lt;/a&gt;: This PR added percentages to the output of cargo-llvm-lines, making it easier to tell how important each function’s contribution is to the total amount of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines/pull/20&quot;&gt;#20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/663&quot;&gt;#663&lt;/a&gt;: These PRs added support for cargo-llvm-lines within rustc-perf, which made it easy to measure the LLVM IR produced for the standard benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72013&quot;&gt;#72013&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;RawVec::grow()&lt;/code&gt; is a function that gets called by &lt;code&gt;Vec::push()&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a large generic function that deals with various cases relating to the growth of vectors. This PR moved most of the non-generic code into a separate non-generic function, for wins of up to 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Even after that PR, measurements show that the vector growth code still accounts for a non-trivial amount of code, and it feels like there is further room for improvement. I made several failed attempts to improve it further: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72189&quot;&gt;#72189&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73912&quot;&gt;#73912&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75093&quot;&gt;#75093&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75129&quot;&gt;#75129&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they reduced the amount of LLVM IR generated, they were performance losses. I suspect this is because these additional changes affected the inlining of some of these functions, which can be hot.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72166&quot;&gt;#72166&lt;/a&gt;: This PR added some specialized &lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt; methods  (&lt;code&gt;for_each()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;all()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;any()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find_map()&lt;/code&gt;) for slices, winning up to 9% on &lt;code&gt;clap-rs&lt;/code&gt;, and up to 2% on various other benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72139&quot;&gt;#72139&lt;/a&gt;: This PR added a direct implementation for &lt;code&gt;Iterator::fold()&lt;/code&gt;, replacing the old implementation that called the more general &lt;code&gt;Iterator::try_fold()&lt;/code&gt;. This won up to 2% on several benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73882&quot;&gt;#73882&lt;/a&gt;: This PR streamlined the code in &lt;code&gt;RawVec::allocate_in()&lt;/code&gt;, winning up to 1% on numerous benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cargo-llvm-lines is also useful to application/crate authors. For example, Simon Sapin managed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/26585&quot;&gt;speed up compilation of the largest crate in Servo by 28%&lt;/a&gt;! Install it with &lt;code&gt;cargo install cargo-llvm-lines&lt;/code&gt; and then run it with &lt;code&gt;cargo llvm-lines&lt;/code&gt; (for debug builds) or &lt;code&gt;cargo llvm-lines --release&lt;/code&gt; (for release builds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71942&quot;&gt;#71942&lt;/a&gt;: this PR shrunk the &lt;code&gt;LocalDecl&lt;/code&gt; type from 128 bytes to 56 bytes, reducing peak memory usage of a few benchmarks by a few percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72227&quot;&gt;#72227&lt;/a&gt;: If you push multiple elements onto an empty &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt; it has to repeatedly reallocate memory. The growth strategy in use resulted in the following sequence of capacities: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. “Tiny vecs are dumb”, so this PR changed it to 0, 4, 8, 16, etc., in most cases, which reduced the number of allocations done by rustc itself by 10% or more and sped up many benchmarks by up to 4%. In theory, the change could increase memory usage, but in practice it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74310&quot;&gt;#74214&lt;/a&gt;: This PR eliminated some symbol interner accesses, for wins of up to 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74310&quot;&gt;#74310&lt;/a&gt;: This PR changed &lt;code&gt;SparseBitSet&lt;/code&gt; to use an &lt;code&gt;ArrayVec&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;SmallVec&lt;/code&gt; for its storage, which is possible because the maximum length is known in advance, for wins of up to 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75133&quot;&gt;#75133&lt;/a&gt;: This PR eliminated two fields in a struct that were only used in the printing of an error message in the case of an internal compiler error, for wins of up to 2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speed changes since April 2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my last blog post, changes in compile times have been mixed (&lt;a href=&quot;https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2020-04-22&amp;amp;end=2020-08-04&amp;amp;stat=wall-time&quot;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://perf.rust-lang.org/index.html?start=2020-04-22&amp;amp;end=2020-08-04&amp;amp;absolute=true&amp;amp;stat=wall-time&quot;&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt;). It’s disappointing to not see a sea of green in the table results like last time, and there are many regressions that seem to be alarming. But it’s not as bad as it first seems! Understanding this requires knowing a bit about the details of the benchmark suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the benchmarks that saw large percentage regressions are extremely short-running. (The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/benchmarks/README.md&quot;&gt;benchmark descriptions&lt;/a&gt; help make this clearer.) For example a non-incremental check build of &lt;code&gt;helloworld&lt;/code&gt; went from 0.03s to 0.08s.  (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/70107&quot;&gt;#70107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74682&quot;&gt;#74682&lt;/a&gt;) are two major causes.) In practice, a tiny additional overhead of a few 10s of milliseconds per crate isn’t going to be noticeable when many crates take seconds or tens of seconds to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the “real-world” benchmarks, some of them saw mixed results (e.g. &lt;code&gt;regex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ripgrep&lt;/code&gt;), while some of them saw clear improvement, some of which were large (e.g. &lt;code&gt;clap-rs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;style-servo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;webrender&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;webrender-wrench&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, since my last post, the compiler is probably either no slower or somewhat faster for most real-world cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting data point about the speed of rustc over the long-term came from Hacker News: compilation of one project (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RustAudio/lewton&quot;&gt;lewton&lt;/a&gt;) got &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23550493&quot;&gt;2.5x faster over the past three years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LLVM 11 hasn’t landed yet, so that will give some big improvements for real-world cases soon. Hopefully for my next post the results will be more uniformly positive.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China Uighurs: A model&amp;#039;s video gives a rare glimpse inside internment</title>

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Merdan Ghappar was used to posing for the camera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a model for the massive Chinese online retailer Taobao, the 31-year-old was well paid to flaunt his good looks in slick promotional videos for clothing brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one video of Mr Ghappar is different. Instead of a glitzy studio or fashionable city street, the backdrop is a bare room with grubby walls and steel mesh on the window. And in place of the posing, Mr Ghappar sits silently with an anxious expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding the camera with his right hand, he reveals his dirty clothes, his swollen ankles, and a set of handcuffs fixing his left wrist to the metal frame of the bed - the only piece of furniture in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;The video Uighur model Merdan Ghappar filmed inside China's detention system&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video of Mr Ghappar, along with a number of accompanying text messages also passed to the BBC, together provide a chilling and extremely rare first-hand account of China's highly secure and secretive detention system - sent directly from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material adds to the body of evidence documenting the impact of China's fight against what it calls the &quot;three evil forces&quot; of separatism, terrorism, and extremism in the country's far western region of Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, credible estimates suggest, more than one million Uighurs and other minorities have been forced into a network of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/China_hidden_camps&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;highly secure camps&lt;/a&gt; in Xinjiang that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-xinjiang/china-says-xinjiang-has-boarding-schools-not-concentration-camps-idUSKBN1QT1E4&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;China has insisted&lt;/a&gt; are voluntary schools for anti-extremism training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of children have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-48825090&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;separated from their parents&lt;/a&gt; and, recent research shows, women have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;forcibly subjected to methods of birth control&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the clear allegations of torture and abuse, Mr Ghappar's account appears to provide evidence that, despite China's insistence that most re-education camps have been closed, Uighurs are still being detained in significant numbers and held without charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also contains new details about the huge psychological pressure placed on Uighur communities, including a document he photographed which calls on children as young as 13 to &quot;repent and surrender&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with Xinjiang currently experiencing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/09464ad1-e377-4a2e-9177-dca1be9b1aec&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; in the number of coronavirus infections, the dirty and crowded conditions he describes highlight the serious risk of contagion posed by this kind of mass detention during a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC sent detailed requests for comment to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and Xinjiang authorities but neither responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Ghappar's family, who have not heard from him since the messages stopped five months ago, are aware that the release of the four minute, thirty-eight second video of him in his cell might increase the pressure and punishment he faces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they say it is their last hope, both to highlight his case and the plight of the Uighurs in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His uncle, Abdulhakim Ghappar, who now lives in the Netherlands, believes the video could galvanise public opinion in the same way that footage of the police treatment of George Floyd became a powerful symbol of racial discrimination in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have both faced brutality for their race,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But while in America people are raising their voices, in our case there is silence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Merdan Ghappar - like many Uighurs at that time - left Xinjiang to seek opportunity in China's wealthier cities in the east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having studied dance at Xinjiang Arts University, he found work first as a dancer and then, a few years later, as a model in the southern Chinese city of Foshan. Friends say Mr Ghappar could earn up to 10,000 Rmb (£1,000) per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story reads like an advert for the country's dynamic, booming economy and President Xi Jinping's &quot;China Dream&quot;. But the Uighurs, with their Turkic language, Islamic faith and ethnic ties to the peoples and cultures of central Asia, have long been viewed as an object of suspicion by Chinese rulers and faced discrimination in wider society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Ghappar's relatives say that Mr Ghappar was told it would be best for his modelling career to downplay his Uighur identity and refer to his facial features as &quot;half-European&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Merdan Ghappar moved from Xinjiang in 2009 to pursue a modelling career
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although he had earned enough money to buy a sizeable apartment, they say he was unable to register it in his own name, instead having to use the name of a Han Chinese friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those injustices now seem mild by comparison with what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since two brutal attacks targeting pedestrians and commuters in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014 - blamed by China on Uighur separatists - the state has begun to view Uighur culture as not only suspicious but seditious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2018, when the state had come up with its answer - the sprawling system of camps and jails built rapidly and extensively across Xinjiang - Mr Ghappar was still living in Foshan, where his life was about to take an abrupt turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August that year, he was arrested and sentenced to 16 months in prison for selling cannabis, a charge his friends insist was trumped up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether truly guilty or not, there was little chance of an acquittal, with statistics showing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duihuaresearch.org/2015/02/behind-rarity-of-chinas-acquittals.html&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;more than 99%&lt;/a&gt; of defendants brought before Chinese criminal courts are convicted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Up to a million Muslims are thought to have been detained in prison camps across Xinjiang

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, upon his release in November 2019, any relief he felt at having served his time was short lived. Little more than a month later, police knocked on his door, telling him he needed to return to Xinjiang to complete a routine registration procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC has seen evidence that appears to show he was not suspected of any further offence, with authorities simply stating that &quot;he may need to do a few days of education at his local community&quot; - a euphemism for the camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 January this year, his friends and family were allowed to bring warm clothes and his phone to the airport, before he was put on a flight from Foshan and escorted by two officers back to his home city of Kucha in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is evidence of other Uighurs being forced to return home, either from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/students-07162018145903.html&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;elsewhere in China&lt;/a&gt; or from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/china-forcing-uighurs-abroad-return-home-why-arent-more-countries&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;abroad&lt;/a&gt;, and Mr Ghappar's family were convinced that he had disappeared into the re-education camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than a month later they received some extraordinary news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, he had managed to get access to his phone and was using it to communicate with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merdan Ghappar's text messages, said to have been sent from the same room as his self-shot video, paint an even more terrifying picture of his experience after arriving in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written via the Chinese social media app WeChat, he explains that he was first kept in a police jail in Kucha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I saw 50 to 60 people detained in a small room no bigger than 50 square metres, men on the right, women on the left,&quot; he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everyone was wearing a so-called 'four-piece-suit', a black head sack, handcuffs, leg shackles and an iron chain connecting the cuffs to the shackles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's use of these combined hand and leg cuffs has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-china-blog-39893359&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;criticised in the past by human rights groups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Ghappar was made to wear the device and, joining his fellow inmates in a caged-off area covering around two-thirds of the cell, he found there was no room to lie down and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I lifted the sack on my head and told the police officer that the handcuffs were so tight they hurt my wrists,&quot; he writes in one of the text messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He shouted fiercely at me, saying 'If you remove your hood again, I will beat you to death'. And after that I dared not to talk,&quot; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dying here is the last thing I want.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He writes about the constant sound of screaming, coming from elsewhere in the jail. &quot;Interrogation rooms,&quot; he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he describes squalid and unsanitary conditions -  inmates suffering from lice while sharing just a handful of plastic bowls and spoons between them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Before eating, the police would ask people with infectious diseases to put their hands up and they'd be the last to eat,&quot; he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But if you want to eat earlier, you can remain silent. It's a moral issue, do you understand?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on 22 January, with China at the height of its coronavirus crisis, news of a massive, nationwide attempt to control the epidemic reached the prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Ghappar's account suggests the enforcement of quarantine rules were much stricter in Xinjiang than elsewhere. At one point, four young men, aged between 16 and 20,  were brought into the cell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;During the epidemic period they were found outside playing a kind of game like baseball,&quot; he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were brought to the police station and beaten until they screamed like babies, the skin on their buttocks split open and they couldn't sit down.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policemen began making all the prisoners wear masks, although they still had to remain hooded in the stuffy, over-crowded cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A hood and a mask - there was even less air,&quot; he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the officers later came around with thermometers, several inmates including Mr Ghappar, registered higher than the normal body temperature of 37C (98.6F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still wearing his &quot;four-piece suit&quot;, he was moved upstairs to another room where the guards kept the windows open at night, making the air so cold that he could not sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, he said, the sounds of torture were much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One time I heard a man screaming from morning until evening,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the prisoners were loaded onto minibuses and sent away to an unknown location. Mr Ghappar, who was suffering from a cold and with his nose running, was separated from the rest and taken to the facility seen in the video he sent - a place he described as an &quot;epidemic control centre&quot;. Once there, he was handcuffed to the bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My whole body is covered in lice. Every day I catch them and pick them off from my body - it's so itchy,&quot; he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, the environment here is better than the police station with all those people. Here I live alone, but there are two people guarding me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the slightly more relaxed regime that gave him, he says, the opportunity he needed to get word out. His phone appears to have remained unnoticed by the authorities among his personal belongings, some of which he was given access to in his new place of imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 18 days inside the police jail, he was suddenly and secretly in touch with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few days he described his experiences. Then, suddenly, the messages stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing has been heard from Mr Ghappar since. The authorities have provided no formal notification of his whereabouts, nor any reason for his continued detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to independently verify the authenticity of the text messages. But experts say that the video footage appears to be genuine, in particular because of the propaganda messages that can be heard in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Xinjiang has never been an 'East Turkistan'&quot;, says an announcement in both Uighur and Chinese from a loudspeaker outside his window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Separatist forces at home and abroad have politicised this geographical term and called for those who speak Turkic languages and believe in Islam to unite,&quot; the announcement says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Millward, a professor of history at Georgetown University and an expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@millwarj/wear-your-mask-under-your-hood-an-account-of-prisoner-abuse-in-xinjiang-during-the-2020-3007a1f7437d&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;translated and analysed&lt;/a&gt; Mr Ghappar's text messages for the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says they are consistent with other well documented cases, from his transportation back to Xinjiang and the initial processing in crowded, unsanitary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This firsthand description of the police holding cell is very, very vivid,&quot; Professor Millward says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He writes in very good Chinese and gives, frankly, a lot of horrific detail about the way these people are treated. So, it's quite a rare source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, and another leading Xinjiang scholar, suggests that the video's real value is what it says about the Chinese government claim that the camp system is being wound down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is extremely significant,&quot; Dr Zenz says. &quot;This testimony shows that the whole system of detaining people, sorting them and then feeding them into extra judicial internment… that this is very much ongoing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another layer of credibility is provided by a photograph of a document that sources say Mr Ghappar sent after finding it on the floor of one of the epidemic control centre toilets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document refers to a speech made by the Communist Party Secretary of Aksu Prefecture, and the date and location suggest it could well have still been circulating in official circles in the city of Kucha around the time of Mr Ghappar's detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document's call for children as young as 13 to be encouraged to &quot;repent for their mistakes and voluntarily surrender&quot; appears to be new evidence of the extent of China's monitoring and control of the thoughts and behaviours of the Uighurs and other minorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think this is the first time I've seen an official notice of minors being held responsible for their religious activity,&quot; says Dr Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder who has researched and written extensively about the Uighurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the risk that the publication of Merdan Ghappar's video and text messages will put him at risk of longer or harsher punishment, those close to him say they no longer have any choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Staying silent will not help him either,&quot; says his uncle, Abdulhakim Ghappar, from his home in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

He has never been back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He insists that all of his political activities, both inside China and abroad, have been peaceful, and his nephew, he says, has never shown any interest in politics at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of questions sent by the BBC to the Chinese authorities asked them to confirm whether Merdan Ghappar or his uncle are suspected of any crime in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also asked why Mr Ghappar was shackled to a bed, and for a response from the authorities to his other allegations of mistreatment and torture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the questions was answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever Merdan Ghappar is now, one thing is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether his earlier conviction for a drugs offence was just or not, his current detention is proof that even well-educated and relatively successful Uighurs can become a target of the internment system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This young man, as a fashion model, has a successful career already,&quot; said Professor Millward. &quot;He speaks wonderful Chinese, writes very well and uses fancy phrases, so clearly this is not someone who needs education for a vocational purpose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Adrian Zenz argues that this is the point of the system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It doesn't actually matter so much what the background of the person is,&quot; he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What matters is that their loyalty has been tested by the system. At some point almost everybody is going to experience some form of internment or re-education, everybody is going to be subjected to this system.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government denies that it is persecuting the Uighur population. After heavy criticism over the issue recently from the US, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, invoked the death of George Floyd, saying that Uighurs in Xinjiang were free in comparison to African Americans in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Merdan Ghappar's family, haunted by the image of him chained to a bed in an unknown location, there is a connection between the two cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I saw the George Floyd video it reminded me of my nephew's own video,&quot; says Merdan's uncle Abdulhakim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The entire Uighur people are just like George Floyd now,&quot; he says. &quot;We can't breathe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
