<title>NBC took Bob Costas off the Super Bowl for speaking out about concussions</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-meta&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;timestamp&quot; data-behavior=&quot;date_time&quot; data-date=&quot;2019-02-10T14:00:00Z&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-dateformat=&quot;date1&quot;&gt;Feb 10, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN DECEMBER 2015&lt;/strong&gt;, the movie &quot;Concussion&quot; was set for a Christmas Day release in nearly 3,000 theaters across America. The film told the story of the NFL's attempts to discredit research tying brain damage to football, and Bob Costas wanted to address it on national television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the previous decade, Costas had become the face of football on NBC, hosting one of TV's most-watched programs, &quot;Sunday Night Football.&quot; As part of every broadcast, Costas would take two minutes at halftime to speak directly to the program's 18 million viewers about the NFL issues of the day. Mostly, his commentaries were celebrations of the sport -- Brady vs. Manning, a tribute to Lambeau Field -- but, occasionally, he addressed subjects like gun control or the controversial name of the Washington, D.C., football team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his 28 Emmys and eight National Sportscaster of the Year awards, Costas had become the most-respected broadcaster of his generation -- a kind of Walter Cronkite for sports. He believed it was his responsibility to address uncomfortable truths, or &quot;elephants in the room,&quot; as he often called them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of &quot;Concussion&quot; seemed a natural topic given the nationwide awakening about head trauma in contact sports, especially the NFL. Costas believed it was important to have viewers confront football's existential crisis and consider their own moral dilemma as fans complicit to the sport's carnage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet he recognized such a speech posed a challenge for his bosses and NBC. The network was paying the NFL billions to air games on Sunday nights. Even more, Costas knew NBC executives were hoping to expand the network's NFL package to Thursdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas sent the essay to his bosses for approval, something he typically did not do -- and waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would ensue that week -- and in the years that followed -- reveals for the first time how a broadcasting icon went from fronting America's most popular sport to being excised from last year's Super Bowl and, ultimately, ending his nearly 40-year career with NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the Lines spoke with the 66-year-old Costas dozens of times over the course of the past year. Those conversations provide not only the never-before-told backstory of how he became an NFL outsider, but also deep insight into his personality: the intelligence and self-assurance that have driven his career; the years-long struggle as he reconciled the celebration of a sport that enriched him financially and helped make him a broadcasting icon, but also weighed so heavily on his conscience; and the insecurity and intense worry -- near agony -- about the possibility of betraying his colleagues and friends by sharing his story. All of it points to the all-encompassing influence of the NFL -- even over the most distinguished broadcaster of his era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Costas wished he had never spoken to Outside the Lines about any of it: &quot;The upside is not equal to the fear I have.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;At his career peak, Bob Costas was everywhere -- Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals, Olympics, Kentucky Derby, golf, boxing, hockey, and on and on. NBC even created a talk show for him, &quot;Later,&quot; which lasted for seven seasons.Â &lt;cite&gt;NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY DECEMBER 2015,&lt;/strong&gt; nobody at NBC should have been surprised that Bob Costas would want to speak his mind about football. After joining the network at age 27 in 1979, he had become one of NBC's signature go-to voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol as his champion, Costas established himself as somebody who could do just about anything: play-by-play, commentary, hosting, interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was everywhere -- Super Bowl, World Series, NBA Finals, Olympics, Kentucky Derby, golf, boxing, hockey, and on and on. NBC even created a talk show for him, &quot;Later,&quot; which lasted for seven seasons and displayed his interviewing talents. The diversity of people Costas interviewed over the years is mind-boggling, speaking to his intelligence and utility: From Johnny Cash to Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Tom Jones to Pierre Salinger, Gary Busey to Ozzy Osbourne, William Shatner to Charlton Heston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just that he was comfortable outside of sports, it's that he melded a near-photographic memory with a genuine interest and passion for pop culture, politics and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, the guy was not only talented, but he had just a great amount of credibility built up between hosting, play-by-play, studio work, his show -- remember, he hosted his own show!&quot; says Vince Wladika, who spent 11 years as a communications executive at Fox and NBC, working with Costas from 1989 to 1994. &quot;Between all that exposure, the audience trusted him. ... There was never an issue with Bob's willingness to speak his mind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wladika recalled an incident during the 1993 NBA Finals when Costas interviewed then-commissioner David Stern in the throes of gambling allegations involving Michael Jordan. The interview grew contentious, and as Costas pressed Stern about Jordan's alleged gambling debts, the commissioner snapped: &quot;How much money do you owe?&quot; To which Costas retorted, &quot;It doesn't matter. I don't represent the NBA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the interview ended, Costas says Ebersol expressed his displeasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dick would have preferred to give the league a little easier ride,&quot; Costas says. &quot;In the end, he always understood I had my view of things. In the big picture, we always worked it out, but there were times when I went off what they would have preferred was the script.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, Costas says, was hardly unusual throughout his career at NBC -- though he and Ebersol remain close and Costas had nothing but glowing things to say about his mentor. Ebersol declined to be interviewed for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas told Outside the Lines that his credibility -- and, frankly, that of the network -- relied on his willingness to address hard topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few subjects are sacred to Costas, even his beloved baseball. Anyone who knows anything about Costas knows that he genuflects to the sport in ways that make non-baseball fans cringe. Still, Costas says he felt obligated to address the steroid scandal as it consumed the sport throughout the 2000s. &quot;A friend of mine said ... 'Whether it's news or sports, you can never go wrong being on the right side of history,'&quot; Costas says. &quot;I was right about steroids in baseball, and I was the only network broadcaster who even mentioned it. And I mentioned it all the damn time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he never heard from Major League Baseball executives or any of his bosses when he talked openly on MLB broadcasts about how the game's most hallowed records were being devalued as baseball's hierarchy stood by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were times, though, when Costas was seen as less aggressive. He hosted his first Olympics in 1992, in the midst of Juan Antonio Samaranch's 21-year run as IOC president. In 1996, journalist Frank Deford conducted a devastating interview of Samaranch for HBO's &quot;Real Sports,&quot; in which he confronted the Olympics chief about his ties to the fascist Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and the fact that he had honored Romanian tyrant Nicolae Ceausescu. In a New York Times piece about the interview, TV critic Richard Sandomir wrote: &quot;Nothing quite so controversial occurs Wednesday at 9 p.m. during 'Prelude to the Games,' the two-hour Olympic preview show produced by Sports Illustrated TV for NBC. Nothing harshly critical of the I.O.C., other Olympic organizations or sponsors is said on the special with Bob Costas as host.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Samaranch's ties to the dictators and why he didn't confront the topic, Costas told Outside the Lines: &quot;If I had interviewed Samaranch, I would have, but Samaranch did not appear for an interview with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas did, however, use the moment of the Ukrainian women's biathlon team taking gold in the 2014 Sochi Games as an opportunity to address Russia's intervention in the country, its &quot;hostile&quot; record on gay rights and its sponsorship of a vicious regime in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;After joining the network at age 27 in 1979, Costas quickly became one of the network's signature go-to voices.Â &lt;cite&gt;Focus on Sport/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN THE SPRING&lt;/strong&gt; of 2005, NBC, led by Ebersol, agreed to pay the NFL $600 million per year to televise its games on Sunday nights. The decision was a direct response to declining viewership, especially among the network's most sought-after demographic: men, age 18-49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC had fled the football arms race back in 1997, complaining that rights fees had risen out of control. Fox had drastically altered the landscape in 1993 when it agreed to pay nearly $400 million per year to air NFL games -- a move that left CBS, the league's original TV partner, out of the NFL package and had practically destroyed the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without the NFL, who could possibly exist? CBS almost proved nobody could,&quot; says former TV executive Rick Gentile, who was with CBS from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw coverage of some of the world's biggest sporting events, including several Super Bowls. &quot;As soon as we lost the NFL, we lost like 16 of our best [affiliate] stations to Fox. It was a devastating blow for the network, and it literally took years and years to pull out.&quot; In 1994, CBS balked at paying $295 million, he says, but when the network got another chance, it was &quot;'How much do you need? Here's the check, fill in the number.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2005, cognizant of CBS's free fall, NBC committed $3.6 billion over the coming six seasons to get back into the NFL fold. &quot;NBC Decides It Can't Live Without Football,&quot; declared a headline in The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Costas says he had sworn off the sport. He had hosted NBC's NFL pregame show for nearly a decade in the '80s and early '90s but asked to be taken off the broadcasts after the 1993 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I got closer and closer to the game, I became ambivalent about it,&quot; he says. &quot;The sheer violence of the game, and then the celebration of that violence, even before CTE became a specific issue ... I just didn't feel comfortable with that. That felt stupid to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas did host &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; on HBO for six seasons beginning in 2002, but he says he justified that in his mind because the show provided autonomy to offer commentary and typically conveyed a level of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when NBC returned to football in 2005, Costas says Ebersol asked him to return as host and he agreed &quot;out of loyalty&quot; and &quot;as kind of a good soldier.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, NBC would own Sunday nights, and Costas would become the emcee of &quot;Football Night in America,&quot; setting the tone for a five-hour broadcast every week. He had a reputation as a trustworthy and reasoned voice, someone who was willing to offer his opinion but not shout it out like a carnival barker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, his relationship with football was growing increasingly complicated. As evidence mounted tying the sport to brain disease, Costas says he felt compelled to talk about it. During Week 2 of the 2010 season, following a series of high-profile, concussion-related incidents, Costas presented his first essay about the topic to NBC viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline editorial float-r&quot; data-behavior=&quot;article_related&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.79498861047836&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2.56&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;&amp;amp;lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:1&quot; href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/25776964/insurance-market-football-evaporating-causing-major-threat-nfl-pop-warner-colleges-espn&quot; class=&quot;img-link&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2019/0117/r489927_2_806x806_1-1.jpg&amp;amp;w=130&amp;amp;h=130&amp;amp;scale=crop&amp;amp;location=center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the NFL to rec leagues, football is facing a stark new threat: An evaporating insurance market that is fundamentally altering the sport's economics, squeezing and even killing off programs faced with higher costs and a scarcity of available coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.66666666666667&quot;&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;&amp;amp;lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:2&quot; href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25841974/nfl-says-concussions-238-percent-last-season&quot; class=&quot;img-link&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2018/1007/r443761_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&amp;amp;w=130&amp;amp;h=130&amp;amp;scale=crop&amp;amp;location=center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NFL says the number of concussion in practices and games dropped significantly in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Related&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;More and more is being learned about the now-undeniable link between concussions especially repeat concussions -- and subsequent problems with dementia, depression, early onset Alzheimer's, an entire array of serious medical problems stemming from an injury that is more common in football than in most other sports.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here's the truth,&quot; Costas said. &quot;America's most popular sport is a fundamentally dangerous game where the risk of catastrophic injury is not incidental, it is significant.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a decisive moment in the history of football in America. Here was the preeminent voice of televised sports, looking straight into the camera, telling millions of fans who tuned in that he, they -- all of us -- were essentially complicit in the human destruction caused by a gladiator sport. Equally surreal -- but unstated -- was the fact that even as Costas was describing the problem as &quot;undeniable,&quot; the NFL was publicly denying any link between football and brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing years, as research accumulated, Costas became more emboldened. His blend of humor, wit and unfiltered opinion was gold on the talk-show circuit -- from CNN to Bill Maher to NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show -- as well as to anyone who wanted to discuss the dangers of football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, in a conversation with Robert Lipsyte of The New York Times, he told an audience, &quot;The game is unacceptably brutal. Can I say it any more clearly than that it is unacceptably brutal?&quot; Two years later, on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; he said, &quot;The way football is currently played in the NFL is fundamentally unsustainable.&quot; And the following year, on &quot;The Last Word,&quot; he called the sport &quot;inherently violent and brutal&quot; and suggested that head trauma could lead to off-field criminal conduct by some players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he never heard from anyone with the NFL complaining about his statements, nor does he say his bosses at NBC protested or suggested they had ever been contacted by league officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentile, the former CBS executive, says it wouldn't surprise him that Costas never received complaints from the NFL -- because the league officials always called Gentile and not the broadcaster himself when they had concerns. Still, Gentile says, the NFL was &quot;never really dictatorial, at least in my lifetime.&quot; It was nothing like, for example, the network's relationship with The Masters, which kept intense pressure on CBS by signing only one-year contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it was that The Masters could force the network to banish Gary McCord from the broadcast for describing Augusta National's speedy greens as &quot;bikini-waxed,&quot; or Jack Whitaker for referring to a &quot;mob&quot; of fans on the 18th green at the end of a playoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentile, though, understands why the NFL might have become more controlling over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's an existential issue,&quot; says Gentile, who also is the director of the Seton Hall University Sports Poll, which conducts regular surveys on sports-related issues. &quot;The NFL is faced with this looming head-injury issue. We conducted polls at Seton Hall and you could see the numbers go up of parents who didn't want their kids to play football. That doesn't speak well to the future, so I think there's a strong sensitivity there [from the NFL]. This is, 'Do we exist or not.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And it's just as important to the networks that the NFL continue to be the NFL.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the more Costas talked definitively about the connection between football and brain damage, the more it created tension between him, his bosses and the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was bound to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;Costas attended a 2015 screening of &quot;Concussion&quot; and was moved by the film's portrayal of Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist who first posited that former NFL players had died with a brain disease caused by football.Â &lt;cite&gt;Andrew Toth/FilmMagic&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TO UNDERSTAND THE&lt;/strong&gt; symbiotic relationships between the television networks and the NFL requires acknowledging the obvious: An undeniable power imbalance exists. The NFL -- like other leagues -- has several options to air games and highlights, from the Big Three networks to ESPN and a variety of cable venues -- and now Facebook, Google, Amazon and other developing media. But there's only one NFL, and only so many games to go around. The result is a financial windfall for the league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFL took in more than $7 billion from its television partners this season. By 2027, according to a USA Today report citing the sports analytics firm Navigate Research, that number could hit $17 billion -- meaning each of the league's 32 teams would pocket more than a half-billion dollars from TV every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ESPN, the network is in the middle of a contract that pays the NFL $1.9 billion per year to air Monday Night Football, a deal set to expire in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are partnerships, but they tilt heavily toward the league's Park Avenue offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Costas: &quot;Look, the NFL isn't just the most important sports property, it's the single-most important property in all of American television. And it isn't even close.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the stakes, the NFL has enormous influence over how networks portray the sport. When a broadcaster like Costas goes rogue, or investigative reporting touches on sensitive issues like concussions or politics, tensions inevitably surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tensions have surfaced at ESPN, which famously cancelled its popular 2003 series Playmakers after only one season following complaints from the NFL. Outside the Lines' yearslong reporting on football's concussion crisis has led to numerous complaints from the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, ESPN abruptly ended a partnership with PBS's award-winning program &quot;Frontline&quot; on &quot;League of Denial,&quot; a documentary that explored the NFL's two-decade effort to deny and rewrite the science connecting football and brain disease. After ESPN pulled out of the deal, The New York Times published a story that suggested the network had bowed to pressure from the NFL. ESPN denied it, saying it dropped out over lack of &quot;editorial control.&quot; ESPN ended up running excerpts from the film and a companion book, as planned, and it continues to cover the concussion issue to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Costas: &quot;The networks, all of them, dance to the NFL's tune. It's just kind of the way it goes. Everyone walks on eggshells around the NFL.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;Costas and his mentor and friend, former NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol.Â &lt;cite&gt;Robin Platzer/FilmMagic&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN 2015, COSTAS&lt;/strong&gt; was invited to a November screening of &quot;Concussion&quot; in Hollywood. He was moved by the film and even thought Will Smith might earn an Oscar nod for his performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist who had ignited the NFL's concussion crisis a decade earlier by first positing that former players had died with a brain disease caused by football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC was scheduled to air Indianapolis at Pittsburgh on Dec. 6. The movie was set largely in Pittsburgh, and former Steelers great Mike Webster was a major character in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was a natural lead-in,&quot; Costas told Outside the Lines. &quot;I thought that the movie would make an impact, and I thought this was a way not only for NBC to acknowledge it, but to get out in front of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas typically wrote his essays on the fly on game day, sometimes even as the first quarter of the Sunday night matchup was under way. This time, though, he wrote it in advance to give his bosses an early look, recognizing it could create problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay, which has never been made public but was provided to Outside the Lines, began with a description of Omalu as &quot;the neuropathologist who clearly demonstrated what just about everybody now understands -- but which for years the league denied: There is a direct and often tragic link between football and brain damage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he sought to mitigate the potential embarrassment for the NFL by highlighting its efforts to improve player safety. &quot;I purposely toned it down,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote, &quot;To its credit, the NFL now has put millions into medical research and the possibility of improving equipment. They have instituted rules changes aimed at making the game safer, awareness programs aimed at youth football, and stricter head trauma protocols, which, even if they don't always work, at least appear to be a step in the right direction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Costas didn't hold back: &quot;Even as the ratings rise, so, too, does a certain ambivalence. Because as much as we may try to push it into the background, there's a kind of Russian roulette going on on the field tonight and on our television screens throughout the fall and winter, since we know that for all the game's appeal, many of its participants will one day pay dearly for their part in our national obsession.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he submitted the essay to Ebersol's successor, NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus, and executive producer Sam Flood and awaited their response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remember the reaction almost verbatim. They said, 'This is a very well-written piece, wouldn't change a comma. We can't air it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he asked why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're in negotiations with the NFL for Thursday Night Football,&quot; he says he was told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was at that point that I realized that this was an untenable situation for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I knew my days there were numbered.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazarus and Flood did not respond to requests seeking comment for this story. An NBC spokesman provided a statement that read, &quot;We have historically given our commentators a lot of leeway to speak on our air about issues and controversies, and Bob has benefited most from this policy. We're very disappointed that after 40 years with NBC, he has chosen to mischaracterize and share these private interactions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before he offered the &quot;Concussion&quot; essay, the tension had ratcheted up between Costas and the network. At the start of the season, the NFL had introduced an ad campaign called &quot;Football is Family.&quot; The spots were designed, in part, to counter negative publicity that had come to surround the league, especially around head trauma. One ad showed female fans wearing their favorite team gear, working out, drinking coffee, taking walks with their similarly decked-out children; another had Packers running back Eddie Lacy mowing the lawns of fans who lived near Lambeau Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the divisional playoffs rolled around -- less than two months after his &quot;Concussion&quot; essay was killed -- Costas had had enough. In speaking with Bob Raissman of the New York Daily News, he said of the league's promotion: &quot;It's a little much to take, while watching a game, that you are constantly bombarded with 'Football is Family' [commercials].&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He described to Raissman the significant number of players &quot;acting like creeps and criminals&quot; and concluded with, &quot;You see all this stuff and the first thing that comes to mind is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a Norman Rockwell painting. Yes, 'Football is Family.' Bring out the hearts and the tinkling piano music, because it really is a touching tableau.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take long for Costas to hear from his bosses: Why did he need to take such a gratuitous potshot at NBC's biggest business partner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My response was, 'The purpose of it is so I can sleep at night,' you know?&quot; he told Outside the Lines. &quot;Some of this is like blinking in a hostage video. It's like, 'You know I sort of have to do this. I hope you get what I'm really thinking right now.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after Costas' &quot;Concussion&quot; essay was rejected and two weeks after he ridiculed the &quot;Football is Family&quot; ads, the NFL announced a contract with NBC to air five Thursday night games in each of the following two seasons. NBC would pay the league another $450 million -- or $45 million per game -- to share the broadcast rights and simulcast the games on the league's own NFL Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;When NBC returned to football in 2005, Costas agreed to return as host &quot;out of loyalty&quot; and &quot;as kind of a good soldier&quot; to NBC. Over the next decade, NBC would own Sunday nights, and Costas would become the emcee of &quot;Football Night in America.&quot;Â &lt;cite&gt;AP Photo/Matt Rourke&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY THE TIME&lt;/strong&gt; NBC was officially signing its new deal, Costas says he had invoked a clause in his contract that would allow him to step away from football and the Olympics to take on an emeritus role. He would host one more season on Sunday nights and then turn the show over to Mike Tirico. Costas' NFL swan song would be Feb. 4, 2018, when NBC next aired the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three months before the Super Bowl, the plan imploded during one dramatic week. First, on Nov. 7, 2017, Costas appeared at a journalism symposium at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, he told a crowd of more than 400, &quot;The issue [in sports] that is most substantial -- the existential issue -- is the nature of football itself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then went on a nearly one-and-a-half minute riff about football and brain damage that was punctuated by this statement: &quot;The reality is that this game destroys people's brains -- not everyone's, but a substantial number. It's not a small number, it's a considerable number. It destroys their brains.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two nights later, Costas was honored by the Concussion Legacy Foundation -- an advocacy group affiliated with researchers who have been at the forefront of the science connecting football and brain disease. Costas accepted the award from CLF to a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, Costas' line at Maryland -- &lt;em&gt;This game destroys people's brains&lt;/em&gt; -- had gone viral, raising hackles in the NBC offices. The New York Daily News asked NBC for comment, and a spokesman responded, &quot;Bob's opinions are his own, and they do not represent those of the NBC Sports Group&quot; -- prompting a story from Raissman under the headline, &quot;NBC throws Bob Costas under the bus and in the process sends warning to rest of its talent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing a budding problem with his employer, Costas says he decided to appear on CNN on Saturday morning to make it clear he wasn't being critical of NBC. So, for the third time in a week, Costas was talking publicly about football and brain damage. He didn't soften any of his comments -- in fact, he reiterated them -- but he did attempt to defend the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've been saying these things for the better part of a decade, and often on NBC, in front of the biggest audience not just in all of sports, but in all of television -- 'Sunday Night Football,'&quot; Costas told host Michael Smerconish. &quot;And I think NBC Sports deserves credit for this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within an hour, Costas says he received a text from Flood, who oversees sports production for NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the words were, 'You've crossed the line,'&quot; says Costas, who says he no longer has the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My thought was, 'What line have I crossed?'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Costas says he pointed out that he had been saying these things about football for years -- often on NBC. That didn't matter; it seemed this was one time too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas was told he was off the Super Bowl LII broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I recall the phrase, 'It's a six-hour, daylong celebration of football, and you're not the right person to celebrate football,'&quot; Costas says. &quot;To which my response was not, 'Oh please, please, change your mind.' My response was, 'Yeah, I guess you're right.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas insists that rather than being upset or feeling punished, he felt relief. Still, he says he and NBC recognized that pulling him off the Super Bowl would raise questions. Costas had a proposal: He should interview Roger Goodell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was looking out not only for myself, because I'd like to do the interview, but I was also looking out for NBC because that would have taken them off the public relations hook and eliminated all the confusion about them supposedly kicking me to the curb or throwing me under the bus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says Lazarus and Flood told him they would check with the NFL. The answer came back quickly: Goodell wouldn't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know how far they went,&quot; Costas says, positing that they could have demurred without argument &quot;as opposed to what you could say, which is this: 'Hey, we pay you guys billions of dollars, and 99 percent of what we do celebrates and promotes the league. Don't you have some obligation to us here? It's our year in the three-year Super Bowl cycle.' I don't know if that kind of pushback took place.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costas says he had asked to interview Goodell before Super Bowl XLIX but been rebuffed then, too. This was not the norm across all sports. Costas says he had regularly interviewed league commissioners during their championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It tells you who calls the shots,&quot; Costas says. &quot;The only business arrangement I can think of where the buyer must continually flatter the seller is the sports TV business. 'We're pulling a Brinks armored truck up to Park Avenue, Mr. Goodell. It contains the billions of dollars that we're going to pay you for the right and privilege to televise your games. But if we've delivered them in a denomination that does not please you, we're terribly sorry, we'll back the truck up, and we'll bring it to you in 20s and 50s if that's the way you'd prefer it.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told Outside the Lines in an email that, often, each network airing the Super Bowl asks for an interview with the commissioner. &quot;Commissioner Goodell has done one sit-down interview in the last five years with the network airing the Super Bowl,&quot; says McCarthy. &quot;That was for the 50th Super Bowl in 2016. Commissioner Goodell has not done an interview with NBC for the four Super Bowls it has aired since he has been commissioner.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy says the NFL did not ask NBC to remove Costas from the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days before the Super Bowl, when NBC first revealed that Costas wouldn't be part of the coverage, statements released by the network suggested that he wasn't doing the game in deference to Liam McHugh and Dan Patrick, who had served as &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; hosts throughout the season. Costas was quoted: &quot;It wouldn't be right for me to parachute in and do the Super Bowl&quot; -- even though that had been precisely the plan before things went awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, in an email to Sports Business Daily, Costas wrote, &quot;The decision was mutually agreeable, and not only do I not have a problem with it, I am actually happy about it. I have long had ambivalent feelings about football, so at this point, it's better to leave the hosting to those who are more enthusiastic about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was only partially true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says Costas now: &quot;I was hoping that the whole thing wouldn't cause a stir. And what I said was true as far as it went. I was completely comfortable with it, I had no personal stake in hosting, I was happy football was in my rearview mirror.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his statements to Sports Business Daily, he had also dismissed any suggestion that his comments at Maryland had prompted NBC to pull him from the game. He wrote about how he had been making these same kinds of comments about football for a long time, &quot;So the idea that I am only now finding my voice on this, or that NBC was taken aback by what I said at Maryland is just wrong. It's all simple and straightforward.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that it wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline inline-photo full&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; lazyload lazyload&quot; data-image-container=&quot;.inline-photo&quot;/&gt;Costas is the only person to win sports, news and entertainment Emmy Awards.Â &lt;cite&gt;Marc Bryan-Brown/WireImage&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN DECEMBER, COSTAS&lt;/strong&gt; was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. At the ceremony, he singled out Lazarus and Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Lazarus, he said, &quot;If there is a better, more reasonable person in a prominent position in network sports than Mark Lazarus, I haven't met him or her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was nothing surprising about this. For the better part of a year, during dozens of conversations with Outside the Lines -- short ones, long ones, in person, on the phone -- Costas made a point of noting how, in spite of everything he was saying, he had no issues with anyone at NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Toward the end, I was something of a square peg in a round hole,&quot; he said during his induction speech, a phrase he had used repeatedly with Outside the Lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was surprising about Costas was not that he was concerned that he might offend anyone at NBC, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; concerned he was. Over the past few months, rarely did a conversation take place without Outside the Lines having to reassure Costas that the story would reflect his respect and admiration for his colleagues, and that he held no ill will toward them or NBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it didn't seem to matter. The conversations would end, Costas would appear to trust the process, and then, days or weeks later, it was like Groundhog Day and the same conversation would occur again. Costas also was concerned with what internet trolls and commenters might say about him after they read the story. Asked why he cared so much when it was clear he couldn't satisfy everyone, Costas replied, &quot;I guess I find unfairness or untruth annoying.&quot; He had suggestions for how to phrase and contextualize certain elements of the piece, and he regularly lamented that some people might perceive him as bitter -- again, despite regular assurances that the story would not reflect him as bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting on Costas revealed not only his mixed feelings about revisiting the more difficult portion of his career, but also NBC's reaction to him making it public. NBC declined to license ESPN its footage involving Costas in a video version of this story that aired on E:60. Costas repeatedly suggested that Outside the Lines reach out to his longtime NBC producer and one of his closest friends, Bruce Cornblatt, saying he would be an excellent resource who would be happy to talk. Cornblatt, though, did not respond to calls and, ultimately, sent a text saying he declined to comment; asked why, Cornblatt didn't respond. Outside the Lines asked an NBC spokesman whether Cornblatt had been told not to cooperate, and the spokesman denied that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Costas says he regretted ever taking part in the story; not because he regretted his comments about football, but because of the strain it created around his relationships with NBC colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken as a whole, it reflected something Costas said in one fashion or another during several conversations with Outside the Lines: As much as he cherished his time at NBC, he and the network simply had reached a point of divergent interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am not a Howard Cosell at the end of his career deciding he doesn't like boxing,&quot; Costas says. &quot;I decided long ago that I had misgivings about football, and I tried to use the forum they gave me to make those points. They gave me bits and pieces, but eventually they took those bits and pieces away from me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Costas had decided he wanted to stop hosting Super Bowls and Olympics, the plan was to take on an emeritus role that would have him appearing to host or offer commentary on select major events or programs. Instead, Costas and NBC agreed to terms this past fall to end his contract early. Costas had said at one point that he expected a joint announcement in January, with both sides releasing statements that described their mutual respect and admiration. Instead, the news trickled out when Costas confirmed it to the New York Post in a Jan. 19 story headlined, &quot;Bob Costas and NBC are quietly and officially broken up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's very fair and very amicable,&quot; Costas told Outside the Lines. &quot;It was a very, very fruitful run of nearly four decades, and I have nothing but respect and appreciation for all of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Lubbers, a producer in ESPN's enterprise and investigative unit, and Julia Theaman, a content associate for Outside the Lines and E:60, contributed to this report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Docs gets an API for task automation</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/google-docs-gets-an-api-for-task-automation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; today announced the general availability of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/&quot;&gt;new API for Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; that will allow developers to automate many of the tasks that users typically do manually in the companyâs online office suite. The API has been in developer preview since last Aprilâs Google Cloud Next 2018 and is now available to all developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Google notes, the REST API was designed to help developers build workflow automation services for their users, build content management services and create documents in bulk. Using the API, developers can also set up processes that manipulate documents &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/documents/batchUpdate&quot;&gt;after the fact&lt;/a&gt; to update them, and the API also features the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/move-text&quot;&gt;insert, delete, move&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/merge&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/format-text&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; text, insert inline images and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/lists&quot;&gt;work with lists&lt;/a&gt;, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1781059&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Zapier-GIF_V2_AC.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;853&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canonical use case here isÂ invoicing, where you need to regularly create similar documents with ever-changing order numbers and line items based on information from third-party systems (or maybe even just a Google Sheet). Google also notes that the APIâs import/export abilities allow you to use Docs for internal content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the companies that built solutions based on the new API during the preview period include Zapier, Netflix, Mailchimp and Final Draft. Zapier integrated the Docs API into its own workflow automation tool to help its users create offer letters based on a template, for example, while Netflix used it to build an internal tool that helps its engineers gather data and automate its documentation workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jeU-tWKeb6g?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What&amp;#039;s next for SemVer</title>
<link>https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver</guid>
<description>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2019-02-11&quot; class=&quot;article_time&quot;&gt;February 11, 2019&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 18, 2009&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the Semantic Versioning specification was announced. More commonly known as SemVer, it provided guidance for developers regarding software versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public API, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your version number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this system âSemantic Versioning.â Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author came from the Ruby world, and around the same time, some big things were brewing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io/&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt; was being brought into the world. Bundler brought a few new things, but the most important features involved specifying dependencies for your projects. Normally, youâd specify which version of a gem your project needed. Instead, Bundler allowed you to specify a range of versions youâd accept, and it would help figure out which version you should use, according to the SemVer rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2010, npm, a similar program for the shiny new Node.js, also shipped, and also used SemVer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these tools, Ruby and Node enjoyed (and still do, to this day) a vibrant open source ecosystem. SemVer is the underlying concept that made this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, SemVer is not perfect. In some ways, I think of SemVer as the &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; of versioning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;large&quot; readability=&quot;5.2413793103448&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gofmtâs style is no oneâs favorite, yet gofmt is everyoneâs favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SemVer has its flaws, but it empirically works better than previous attempts at such a thing. That such a thing exists is far more important than how perfect it is. Fundamentally, version numbers are a communication tool, and SemVer provides a framework for said communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, SemVer &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have flaws. Bundler, &lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, Rustâs Cargo, NuGet, and a variety of tools have implemented the specification. But there are edge cases, as well as gaping holes, in the spec, and so in some ways, these tools are incompatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, several of us&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have been talking, and today, we have an announcement to make. Weâve formed a semver team, and we intend to start work on producing a new version of the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is âweâ? The team roster will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/semver/teams/maintainers/members&quot;&gt;in a GitHub team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://words.steveklabnik.com/what-s-next-for-semver#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but for posterityâs sake, hereâs the initial list of members, in the same order GitHub lists them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anand Gaurav, NuGet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dave Herman, Notion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AndrÃ© Arko, Bundler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isaacs, npm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samuel Giddins, CocoaPods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Klabnik, Cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Iâm putting myself as âCargo,â because Cargo is the main client of my SemVer implementation. In most of these projects, the person who maintains the SemVer implementation is the same as the project, but in Rust, theyâre separate. Cargo is the higher-order bit here, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have not yet started the work on the next iteration of the specification, but we have agreed on a governance model for SemVer. Described in the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/semver/semver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, weâre going with an RFC process, similar to the Rust programming language and many other projects. In short, âsubstantialâ changes to the SemVer spec need to go through a process by which a written description of the changes are proposed, and the team reaches consensus on acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also contains some principles we have for the future of SemVer. Iâve copied the important ones for the specification itself here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No RFC will be approved if it is deemed to cause significant breakage to any of the SemVer-using communities represented by the SemVer Maintainers group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RFCs will be considered formally adopted only when they are approved by the SemVer Maintainers group, and implemented in a simple majority of represented implementations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementations may add functionality in advance of an approved RFC but all such functionality must be flagged as âexperimentalâ, so that users understand it may change in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, we donât intend to re-write the spec, but instead, fill in holes in the spec, find out where our implementations differ, and unify all of our implementations as much as is feasible. We believe that this will not only help all of us, but also help new tools as well. Being compatible with each other is an important part of the value of these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to letting you know when our work is done! If youâd like to get involved, please watch that governance repository, and submit RFCs! While weâre all excited about the future of SemVer, itâs nobodyâs job to do this work. As such, weâll be moving fairly slowly. Please be patient. Thanks :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://haacked.com/archive/2019/02/11/semver-collective/&quot;&gt;Philâs post&lt;/a&gt;, reflecting on this transition from the other side. Thanks for being so much of a good steward of SemVer so far, Phil!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;307&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;307&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos&lt;/p&gt;

Mongo isnât exciting anymore, Angular 1 is dead, CoffeeScript is obsolete, I havenât heard a word about Meteor since it launchedâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It beats being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/&quot;&gt;Magpie Developer&lt;/a&gt;. I have more time time to pet my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ziggyforamerica.com&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;, read a lot of books, make fresh pasta by hand, and circle a more slowly evolving collection of powerful technologies that letâs me get stuff done without spending half my free time chasing shiny new things.&lt;/p&gt;

More Tagliatelle, less code.
&lt;p&gt;By and large I find enough time to explore new browser features like CSS Grid and Service Workersâthings I can actually use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years into its hype cycle, itâs probably safe to say the React &lt;em&gt;patterns&lt;/em&gt;, if not the library itself, has staying power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the Wes Bos tutorial a few years ago, said, yep, this is cool, and it would be a good tool for the job if you made an app with a lot of changing visual state, like Asana or Jira. But a news site, for example, which is all about reading text on a page, doesnât reap the benefits.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Iâve also noticed another possible benefit: if you have a big team with a range of skill levels, it gives you a predefined pattern on how to break up and assign work without every person needing to understand the whole organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâs all well and good. One of these days, I thought, I should do a toy project in it. And after a year of looking for one, Iâm starting to realize something very odd: I canât find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donât make side projects for other people anymore, but I make all sorts of little things for myself. In addition to this site, I have a homemade expense tracking app&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, an automated newsletter to myself thatâs composed from RSS feedsâ¦ etc. Iâve toyed with a cooking app a few times but concluded without a lot of manual work to turn recipes into structured data, itâs not actually better than Dropbox Paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at these, theyâre almost all CRUD apps, even if the âCreateâ comes from an API, RSS feed, or webhook. Something puts data in them, and they do something with the information that you couldnât do 10 years ago when it was tied up in Email/Documents/Spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one more thing: itâs possible to make fast, efficient CRUD apps the same way we made them in 2010. Fire up Django or Rails, stick the data in Postgres, put some thought into your forms and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; add a tiny bit of javascript to enhance some input fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely I must be missing something. Surely the billions of programming hours that have gone into all these new things arenât in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never mind that. I decided to build my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in.&quot;&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; replacement. Itâs easy. Pinboard isâ¦ pretty good, but I like the idea of a hybrid between a bookmarking service that could also keep images and markdown notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started playing around, using Django Rest Framework for the API, Rollup to build because Rollup is easy, Preact because its smaller and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâm liking classes for bigger components like the bookmarks index and stateless functions for each item in the list. Thereâs a natural obviousness to writing &lt;code&gt;handleClick&lt;/code&gt; methods for everything that can be clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâm using a pubSub pattern for state management because Redux, while people like it, felt wildly overcomplicated for what I wanted to do. The components listen on a single shared &lt;code&gt;pubSub&lt;/code&gt; event bus, but can tell any API service to update itself, which will then kick off the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced to an illustrative example, it looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;js&quot;&gt;import { pubSub, EVENTS, bookmarksService } from &quot;../services&quot;;
import { SearchForm, BookmarkComponent } from &quot;./other-components&quot;;

export class BookmarkIndex extends Component {

  handleLoadBookmarks({ bookmarks, filters, pagination }) {
    this.setState({
      marks: bookmarks,
      filters: filters,
      pagination: pagination,
    });
  }

  componentWillMount() {
    pubSub.on(EVENTS.load_bookmarks, this.handleLoadBookmarks.bind(this));
    bookmarksService.update();
  }

  componentWillUnMount() {
    pubSub.off(EVENTS.load_bookmarks, this.handleLoadBookmarks.bind(this));
  }

  search(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const query = e.target.querySelector('[name=&quot;search&quot;]').value;
    bookmarksService.update({ search: query });
  }

  handleClear(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    bookmarksService.update({});
  }

  render(props, state) {
    const marks = state.marks || [];

    return (
      &amp;lt;div class=&quot;l-app&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;div class=&quot;l-main&quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;SearchForm searchAction={this.search.bind(this)} /&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;section class=&quot;c-marks&quot;&amp;gt;
            {marks.map(BookmarkComponent)}
          &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    );
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâs kind of cool. Iâve got a clear, predictable one-way data flow without any of the cognitive overhead I saw in the popular state managers. A service represents shared state. Any component ask the service to do something, and any component can listen for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I just spent an enormous amount of time implementing what would have been something like this if it were just server-side Python&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;python&quot;&gt;def bookmarks(request):
    bookmarks = Bookmark.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    search = request.GET.get('search', None)
    tag = request.GET.get('tag', None)

    if search:
        bookmarks = bookmarks.special_search_method(search)

    if tag:
        bookmarks = bookmarks.search_by_tag(tags=tag)

    return render(request, &quot;bookmarks.html&quot;, {
        &quot;bookmarks&quot;: bookmarks,
    })

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Preact stuff is kind of fun. But it feels like adding a lot of complexity, and I canât pin down how it benefits most of these projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of SPAs, some people argued that it would be faster to only pass the data you need as JSON than to render whole pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade later, this is almost never true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The âRecent Chargesâ page of my budget app is 5kb of HTML.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pinboard clone loads 400 bytes of HTML, followed by 36kb of javascript, and 35kb of data from the API. The JS bundle alone is more than 7x the weight of the rendered page, canât be called until the first HTTP request completes, and still has to make an API call.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory subsequent actions might be faster once the page is loaded. That may be true, particularly if the pages are cluttered, and only some components need to update on an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that assumes you make subsequent actions more often that initial actions. That may be true for Slack. But if I think about how I use Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Atlassian apps, or almost any other large js-heavy application, I find myself jumping in and out of them alongside other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thatâs especially true for a bookmarks manager: my main use case is to open in and search for something very specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of a few things that would benefit from being SPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chat application is a no-brainer. A dashboard of realtime data might not need to be a SPA, but would benefit from a reactive component that updates when the API is polled. Maybe a complicated tool like Trello, a Calendar or a Nonlinear Video Editor could make sense, but even those have distinct screens, so a large reactive component on a particular screen may be a better fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatâs more interesting is how many apps Iâm seeing built as an SPA that really donât need to be. Why does a website that orders food from restaurants need a Megabyte of javascript?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to figure that out by inspecting the API calls. It turned out they were tracking every mouse event. So thatâs niceâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why consider this app in Preact in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs because of Progressive Web Apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâd like to try and make it work offline. To do that, and do it well, you need a way to show the data in different ways even when you canât call a server. This calls for javascript templating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I finished the list pageâit has pagination, search, tags, etc. all workingâbut still need to do the create and edit. Itâs taken longer than I feel like it should, and I havenât even started the Service Worker component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donât have a conclusion. Itâs messy and complicated. As a way to learn, the Bookmarks project is fun. As a productive and maintainable thing, itâs not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may tear it down the moment I finish and switch to a traditional MVC style, or find a more minimalistic approach that can work well with offline support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, stop coding and pet your dog. He would appreciate a belly rub.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tasks That Can Be Done with Pure HTML and CSS</title>
<link>https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/4399/get-these-dependencies-off-my-lawn-5-tasks-you-didnt-know-could-be-done-with-pure-html-and-css</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/4399/get-these-dependencies-off-my-lawn-5-tasks-you-didnt-know-could-be-done-with-pure-html-and-css</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some things that are built into the HTML and CSS standards that you probably didn't know about. Or maybe you did. Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back in my day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/&quot;&gt;you had to write like two lines of JavaScript to implement smooth scrolling&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, you can do &lt;a href=&quot;https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;html{ scroll-behavior:smooth; }&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 256 KilobytesÂ website uses the CSS snippet above for smooth scrolling. Click a link in the table of contentsÂ to test the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to working when users scroll to anchors,Â if you Ctrl+F on a page with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;html{ scroll-behavior:smooth; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it smooth scrolls to the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hsl-colors-are-built-into-the-css-standard&quot;&gt;HSL Colors are Built Into the CSS Standard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;gt; spend seven years doing internet marketing&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; discover basic color formats today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.283950617284&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HSL color model defines a given color according to its hue, saturation, and lightness components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;Â   &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#hsl()&quot;&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#hsl()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how HSL colors work, here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://hslpicker.com/&quot;&gt;a tool that demonstrates how HSL colors work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;auto-embed youtube&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/A60HjujkzhI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSL (and HSLA, to adjust opacity) colors can be used anywhere that RGB, hexadecimal, and named colors can be used.Â Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theres-a-fucking-built-in-html-toggle&quot;&gt;There's a fucking built-in HTML toggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fucking built-in HTML toggle, created through using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt; tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;details&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;Sample Text&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Read this sample text.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/details&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;details&gt;Sample Text
&lt;p&gt;Read this sample text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they say in my home country, &quot;JavaScript is for casuals.&quot; Or, alternatively, as they also say in my home country, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-that-details-summary-is-the-easiest-way-ever-to-make-an-accordion/&quot;&gt;you could write JavaScript and/or CSS, but that sounds hard&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;html5-has-built-in-progress-bars-and-meters&quot;&gt;HTML5 Has Built-In Progress Bars and Meters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this extremely self-explanatory section of this article about &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;progress&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meter&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;meter value=&quot;4&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Section 4 of 5&lt;/meter&gt;&lt;progress value=&quot;69&quot; max=&quot;420&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;meter value=&quot;0.69&quot;&gt;69%&lt;/meter&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meter value=&quot;4&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;5&quot;&amp;gt;Section 4 of 5&amp;lt;/meter&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;progress value=&quot;69&quot; max=&quot;420&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/progress&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meter value=&quot;0.69&quot;&amp;gt;69%&amp;lt;/meter&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;css-variables-exist-as-do-attribute-selectors&quot;&gt;CSS Variables Exist (As Do Attribute Selectors)Â &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/you-might-not-need-a-css-framework/&quot;&gt;others have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, adding CSS frameworks (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;) and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hNDzcpWwFM&quot;&gt;CSS preprocessors&lt;/a&gt; (such as SASS, LESS, and SCSS) to a project can, in many cases, add unneededÂ bloat, dependencies, complexity,Â and technical debt, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem obvious, it is more common than you might expect for developers to be unaware thatÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables&quot;&gt;CSS variables&lt;/a&gt; exist natively and they're &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQUB039MG0I&quot;&gt;very straightforward to pick up&lt;/a&gt;, if they're new to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors&quot;&gt;Attribute selectors&lt;/a&gt; are another example of native CSS functionality that can solve problems that developers often overcomplicate. Do you want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Style all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags (links) that have &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt;Â values that end with .pdf or that startÂ with &quot;https&quot;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style all links that have the &lt;code&gt;rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;target=&quot;_blank&quot;&lt;/code&gt;Â attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style all form inputs with the attribute and value ofÂ &lt;code&gt;type=&quot;email&quot;&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all tasks that can be done purely with CSS attribute selectors with no need forÂ jQuery, SASS, and/or other external dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;auto-embed youtube&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/GVocONem9lw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while you're here reading about CSS functionality that developers are often unaware of, check outÂ the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Combinators_and_multiple_selectors&quot;&gt;documentation on combinators and selector lists&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably even learned something. Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew all of these things and this is a bad article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Probably Someone&lt;/p&gt;

It was not very much, especially at the beginning, but it also seemed to exist on a different plane from my actual job. I worked as hard and as much as I could, and then twice a month a dollar amount materialized in my checking account. My time did not feel tethered to this money. My paycheck was just a byproduct of going into an office every day, and a pretty arbitrary one at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjrw86791000w3g66617f6hsx@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;102&quot;&gt;But once I started freelancing, things changed. I became hyperconscious of how much money I could (or should) charge for my time, and this made me unhappy and mean when my nonworking hours didnât measure up to the same value. It was akin to the rage of watching cab fare tick up while youâre sitting in traffic, minutes and dollars dribbling away before your eyes. A freelancer friend recently commiserated: âI went outside to get coffee and ran into three different neighbors who wanted to chit-chat. I wanted to scream, âFor every word that comes out of your mouth, Iâm losing money!ââ&lt;/p&gt;

But I was also stressed out. I started sleeping less, and I stopped hanging out with my friends as much as I wanted. And I would sometimes fall apart completely, frittering away a Saturday in bed and feeling horrible about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/ad/instances/cjrw8637g000gj4y6armqus57@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-0-600&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/The_Cut_Mobile&quot; data-sizes=&quot;528x379&quot; data-label=&quot;outStreamMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;TheCut&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-UNaOumJs&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjrw867g2000z3g66wmedxyx5@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;68&quot;&gt;Many Americans fall into this trap. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550616649239&quot;&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that 63 percent of respondents valued money over time, while the smaller percentage of people who valued time over money &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550615623842&quot;&gt;reported greater well-being&lt;/a&gt; than the larger group. This correlation was consistent even after researchers controlled for factors like income â which complicates the assumption that prioritizing time over money is a luxury that only rich people can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjrw867i000103g666aw1sclz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;86&quot;&gt;As the economy moves away from traditional salaried jobs and toward contract gigs, more and more people are starting to feel like I did. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/time-money-when-youre-paid-hour&quot;&gt;Other studies found&lt;/a&gt; that billing by the hour â no matter how much people charged â compounded the tendency to view time and money as one and the same. Those who did so were less likely to take pleasure in leisure activities, because they were too preoccupied by the opportunity cost of their time. Again, these trends were similar across income levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/ad/instances/cjrw8637g000ej4y6jnsso61j@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-0-600&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/The_Cut_Mobile&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250,300x252,320x100&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;TheCut&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-UPcyrSRc&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjrw867kt00113g66280jm7dq@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;151&quot;&gt;While time versus money anxiety may be more acute for freelancers, we arenât the only ones who struggle with it. In a recent survey of 2.5 million Americans across all socioeconomic strata, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/cover-story/2019/01/time-for-happiness&quot;&gt;80 percent of respondents&lt;/a&gt; said that they didnât have enough time to do what they wanted every day. Psychologist Ashley Whillans, a professor at the Harvard Business School who researches âtime povertyâ (also known as the feeling of running 20 minutes late to everything in your life), attributes this to an increasingly volatile job landscape. âMost people donât have the same jobs for 10 or 15 years like previous generations did, which leads to a feeling of financial insecurity,â she says. âIt isnât about how financially secure you really are, or how much money you have in the bank, but how financially secure you &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; that predicts whether you are willing to give up time to have more money.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/ad/instances/cjrw8637g000fj4y6j92it0dg@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-600-1024&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/nym.thecut&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleTablet&quot; data-site=&quot;TheCut&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-ssGHnbEE&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjrw867m700123g660xveqr77@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;171&quot;&gt;If valuing money over time is making us sad and paranoid, how do we stop? The solution, Whillans suggests, lies in changing your approach to time âoff.â It may be too late to decouple time and money in our brains, especially when finances feel tight, but we can lean into that. âIf weâre already in the time-is-money mindset, we can reframe our leisure time as something that enables us to be more productive in the future,â says Whillan. âWhen weâre conditioned to think of all our time as âon the clock,â leisure time feels abstract and unsatisfying. But if we tell ourselves that leisure time is another means to achieve that goal or financial outcome, that can make us more likely to take the breaks that we need, enjoy them fully, and be happier in general.â If it helps you to think of it this way, great. But you also have permission to just relax, without worrying about how to improve your productivity when youâre once again hunched over your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/ad/instances/cjrw8637g000ej4y6jnsso61j@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-0-600&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/The_Cut_Mobile&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250,300x252,320x100&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;TheCut&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-D6PaRawI&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjrw867oa00133g66d98h36m4@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;93&quot;&gt;Another trick is to figure out what youâre willing (and can afford) to outsource and what youâd prefer do yourself, says Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia. Sheâs &lt;a href=&quot;https://dunn.psych.ubc.ca/&quot;&gt;currently researching&lt;/a&gt; time-versus-money tradeoffs through an app called Joy that asks users to rate which time-saving expenses make them happiest. (Laundry services rank high, she says, while fast-food purchases do not.) Here, of course, is where income makes a significant difference; not everyone can afford the luxury of ordering out so they can finish another draft of a freelance project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjrw867qg00143g668hkeldxm@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;92&quot;&gt;âOur work does show that buying time, or paying your way out of things that donât bring you a lot of satisfaction, buffers people against the negative effects of time stress,â explains Dunn. What she does not recommend, however, is sacrificing healthy activities you enjoy in order to make more money, at least when you can help it. âIf walking your dog is a fulfilling part of your day but you need to pay someone else to do it in order to work on a boring project, you might reconsider your priorities.â&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Next.js 8 released</title>
<link>https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;We are proud today to introduce the production-ready Next.js 8, featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;As always, we have strived to ensure all these benefits are &lt;strong&gt;completely backwards compatible&lt;/strong&gt;. For most Next.js applications, all you need to do is run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;We are thankful to our community and everyone who has bet on our success. Since our last blog post, we have seen companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://att.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.twitch.tv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; relaunch their public-facing websites and apps with Next.js.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-3515570429&quot;&gt;The Next.js serverless target outputs Serverless functions from pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Serverless deployment dramatically improves reliability and scalability by splitting your application into smaller parts (also calledÂ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;lambdas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;). In the case of Next.js, each page in theÂ &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt;Â directory becomes a serverless lambda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;There areÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-express-js-lambdas-with-now-2#benefits-of-serverless-express&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;a number of benefits&lt;/a&gt;Â to serverless. The referenced link talks about some of them in the context of Express, but the principles apply universally: serverless allows for distributed points of failure, infinite scalability, and is incredibly affordable with a &quot;pay for what you use&quot; model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;To enableÂ &lt;strong&gt;serverless mode&lt;/strong&gt;Â in Next.js, add theÂ &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;serverless&lt;/code&gt;Â  build Â &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;Â in Â &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;next.config.js&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  target&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;serverless&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;TheÂ &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;serverless&lt;/code&gt;Â target will output a single lambda per page. This file is completely standalone and does not require any dependencies to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;jsx-4174857952&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;pages/index.js&lt;/code&gt;Â =&amp;gt;Â &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;.next/serverless/pages/index.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;pages/about.js&lt;/code&gt;Â =&amp;gt;Â &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;.next/serverless/pages/about.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;The signature of the Next.js Serverless function is similar to the Node.js HTTP server callback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;req&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; http&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;IncomingMessage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; http&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;ServerResponse&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Next.js provides low-level APIs for serverless deployments as hosting platforms have different function signatures. In general you will want to wrap the output of a Next.js serverless build with a compatability layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;For example if the platform supports the Node.jsÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_server&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;http.Server&lt;/a&gt;Â class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; http &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;http&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; page &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;./.next/serverless/about.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; server &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;http&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;req&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; page&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;req&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
server&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; console&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Listening on http://localhost:3000&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;jsx-4174857952&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;Low-level API for implementing serverless deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;Every page in theÂ &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt;Â directory becomes a serverless function (lambda)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;Creates the smallest possible serverless function (&lt;strong&gt;50 KB&lt;/strong&gt; base zip size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;Optimized for fastÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeit.co/blog/serverless-ssr#cold-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;cold start&lt;/a&gt;Â of the function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;The serverless function has 0 dependencies (they are included in the function bundle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;Uses theÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;http.IncomingMessage&lt;/a&gt;Â andÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;http.ServerResponse&lt;/a&gt;Â from Node.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;opt-in usingÂ &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;target: 'serverless'&lt;/code&gt;Â inÂ &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;next.config.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; target is still fully supported and maintained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;publicRuntimeConfig&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;serverRuntimeConfig&lt;/code&gt; are not supported in the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;serverless&lt;/code&gt; mode. Use build-time configuration instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;We have contributed to webpack to improve Next.js's (and the rest of the webpack ecosystem's!) build performance and resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;This effort has resulted in up to &lt;strong&gt;16 times better memory usage with no degradation in performance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Memory gets released much more quickly and processes don't crash anymore under lots of stress (many pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;We will be going in-depth on how we've achieved this optimization soon. Keep an eye out on the &lt;a class=&quot;jsx-4094826953&quot; href=&quot;https://nextjs.org/blog/&quot;&gt;Next.js blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;While reviewing Next.js applications an often reoccurring pattern we observed was adding &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;babel-plugin-transform-define&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;webpack.DefinePlugin&lt;/code&gt; to provide configuration values to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;With Next.js 8 we are introducing a new key to &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;next.config.js&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; to provide the same functionality in a backwards compatible way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  env&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    customKey&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'MyValue'&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;This will allow you to use &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;process.env.customKey&lt;/code&gt; in your code. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;IndexPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;The value &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; customEnv is&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;env&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;customEnv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;h1&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;process.env.customEnv&lt;/code&gt; will be replaced with &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;'MyValue'&lt;/code&gt; at build time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;The Next.js router allows you to prefetch pages for faster navigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Link &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'next/link'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;IndexPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/about&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;prefetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;To About Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;It works by prefetching the Javascript bundle of every link that has a &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;prefetch&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;In versions before Next.js 8 this would mean injecting a &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag into the document &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;However this introduced some overhead while opening pages, most notably the browser &quot;loading&quot; indication would show longer than you would expect even though the page could be interacted with already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;In Next.js 8 &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;prefetch&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;preload&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. It also only starts prefetching after &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;onload&lt;/code&gt; to allow the browser to manage resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Additionally, Next.js now detects 2G internet and &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;navigator.connection.saveData&lt;/code&gt; mode to disable prefetch on slower network connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;As Next.js pre-renders HTML, it wraps pages into a default structure with &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the JavaScript files needed to render the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextjs.org/blog/next-7/#smaller-initial-html-payload&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;Next.js 7 we optimized the initial payload to 1.50KB&lt;/a&gt;, which was a 7.4% reduction from the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;We were able to further reduce the initial payload size to 1.16KB a further 23% reduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;&lt;thead class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;Â &lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;7.0&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;8.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;delta&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot; readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;Document size (server rendered)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;1.50KB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;1.16KB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;23%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;jsx-693646109&quot;&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;The main ways we have reduced size are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;jsx-4174857952&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;The page initialization inline script was removed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;/_error&lt;/code&gt; page is no longer included on every page load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Whenever a error occurs in production the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;/_error&lt;/code&gt; page is rendered to display that an error occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Ever since the first release of Next.js the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;/_error&lt;/code&gt; page script tag was part of the initial html, meaning it was loaded even though it wouldn't be used if there were no runtime errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Starting with Next.js 8 the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;/_error&lt;/code&gt; page is loaded on-demand when an error occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Meaning that there is less code to be loaded, parsed, and executed by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;One of Next.js's primary goals is to provide the best production performance with &lt;strong&gt;the best possible developer experience&lt;/strong&gt;. This release includes many subtle improvements based on user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Out of the box, Next.js automatically compiles only pages that are &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; being developed. Next.js does not compile all pages in the pages directory each time &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;next dev&lt;/code&gt; is run. Instead, it compiles pages as you access them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;For example, when visiting &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000/my-page&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;pages/my-page.js&lt;/code&gt; file is compiled on-demand, after which the page is rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;This ensures the developer does not have to wait for all pages to compile when launching the development server, which can take quite some time on larger apps. It keeps memory usage low and the compiler fast, since the compiler is not required to take all pages into account when bundling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-2541327965&quot;&gt;The on-demand entries flow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;When a page has not been accessed for 25 seconds, it will be disposed from the compiler's build cache to keep the compiler fast and reduce memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;The way Next.js keeps track of pages being accessed is using a polling mechanism. Every 5 seconds, an &quot;on-demand-entries-ping&quot; is sent to make the Next.js development server aware that a given page is being accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Since the initial release of this feature, the ping was done using a &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;window.fetch&lt;/code&gt; call, meaning that every time the ping was triggered, it would show up in browser development tools on the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;console&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;network&lt;/code&gt; tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;One of the most requested features is the ability to hide these requests from the browser developer tools since these requests can add unnecessary noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;We are excited to announce that in Next.js 8, the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; based ping has been replaced by a WebSockets-based approach, meaning that pings still happen but are only visible when inspecting the WebSocket connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ijjk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;JJ Kasper&lt;/a&gt; for collaborating on the conversion to WebSockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;When starting the Next.js development server, it has to run some initial compilation to be able to serve requests, by default, Next.js would wait for this compilation step to finish before starting the HTTP server, meaning that if you ran &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;next dev&lt;/code&gt; and then went to your browser it could sometimes happen that you'd get a &quot;This site canât be reached&quot; message because the HTTP server was not listening for connections yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;With Next.js 8 the HTTP will be listening for connections before the compilation starts, meaning that if you go to &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000/&lt;/code&gt; before compilation has finished the request will wait for the initial compilation to finish before serving the request, instead of having to refresh the page until it becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/exogen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;Brian Beck&lt;/a&gt; for implementing this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Next.js focuses on the idea ofÂ &lt;strong&gt;pre-rendering&lt;/strong&gt;Â as a means to achieve high performance. Pre-rendering comes in two forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;jsx-4174857952&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server rendering&lt;/strong&gt; where each request triggers a render. As a result, the end-user doesn't have to wait for any JS to be downloaded to start consuming data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;jsx-3649179126&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static rendering&lt;/strong&gt; where we output static files that can be served directly without any code execution on the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Starting from Next.js 8, static rendering through &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;next export&lt;/code&gt; will have speed improvements if your machine has multiple CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Based on tests with a 4 CPU cores MacBook the exporting speed went from approximately 25 pages per second to 75 pages per second by taking advantage of all cores to pre-rendering pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Next.js will automatically detect the number of CPU cores and distribute the pages accordingly, no need for any code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bkniffler&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;Benjamin Kniffler&lt;/a&gt; for implementing this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;A common need when building applications is updating the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element of a page. For example to set the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for responsive design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Next.js exposes a built-in component to introduce changes to the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Head &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'next/head'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;IndexPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;My page title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component can even be used multiple times in different components, for example your layout component could set some default head tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;However you might want to override the default head tags with a different value, in older versions of Next.js this would cause the tag to be duplicated in the output, as there was no way to deduplicate tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;For this reason it is now possible to provide a &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; property to every element inside the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; component which will automatically deduplicate tags with the same &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;When setting &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;key=&quot;viewport&quot;&lt;/code&gt; on two tags only the last one is rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Head &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'next/head'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;IndexPage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;My page title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;viewport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;viewport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;viewport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;initial-scale=1.2, width=device-width&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;viewport&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;Head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain-text&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;In Next.js 6 we introduced the option to add a &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;crossOrigin&lt;/code&gt; attribute to &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;NextScript&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;pages/_document.js&lt;/code&gt;, however this did not cover all use cases for setting &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;cross-origin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Next.js has a client-side router that dynamically injects &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, these tags were missing the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;cross-origin&lt;/code&gt; attribute when injected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;To ensure all &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags have the &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;cross-origin&lt;/code&gt; set, we have introduced a new configuration option in &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;next.config.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-jsx&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;jsx-3160555269&quot;&gt;
module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  crossOrigin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'anonymous'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Another benefit of introducing this option is that a custom &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;pages/_document.js&lt;/code&gt; is no longer needed to set up &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;cross-origin&lt;/code&gt; in your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;The previous behavior is still supported but will emit a warning in development to aid developers in moving to the newly introduced option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;When using Next.js 7 and below, to enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP)&lt;/a&gt; the user had to include &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;script-src 'unsafe-inline'&lt;/code&gt; in their policy because Next.js would create an inline &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to pass data, for example to pass the result of &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;getInitialProps&lt;/code&gt; to the client side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;With Next.js 8 we have changed this inline script tag to a JSON tag for safe transfer to the client. This means that there are no inline scripts included by Next.js anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;With careful consideration &lt;code class=&quot;jsx-4016328902&quot;&gt;script-src 'self'&lt;/code&gt; can now be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;One of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/153&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;most requested examples of all time&lt;/a&gt; has been how to do authentication in Next.js against an external API, any API, in any programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;With the introduction of Next.js 8 we are also introducing a newly created example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cookie-auth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;with-cookie-auth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;This example shows how to authenticate against an external Node.js API, but the concepts applied work for any stateless API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;The example uses a cookie to share the token between the server-side and client-side rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;That way if the app is rendered on the server, it can still fetch authenticated data on the user's behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/j0lv3r4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; class=&quot;jsx-329029718&quot;&gt;Juan Olvera&lt;/a&gt; who contributed the example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;jsx-537101091&quot;&gt;Ever since its first release Next.js has been used in everything from Fortune 500 companies to personal blogs. We're very excited to see the continued growth in Next.js adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/raspberry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;raspberry&quot;&gt;Raspberry&lt;/a&gt; Pi Foundation just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/guess-what/&quot;&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; a brand new project â an actual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-store/&quot;&gt;store&lt;/a&gt;. If you live in Cambridge in the U.K., you can now buy a bunch of sweet Raspberry Pis with which to tinker and develop some cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi has always been about making coding more accessible. And a physical retail space fits the bill. The foundation has developed a lineup of insanely cheap computers with an ARM-based processor, a bunch of ports, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLBVAUo586A?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest flagship model, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, costs only $35. But if you want something smaller and cheaper, there are other models for various needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you just need a tiny computer for some Internet-of-Things project. You can opt for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ for $25 in that case. It has a bit less RAM and fewer ports, but it works pretty much like any Raspberry Pi. Thereâs also power-efficient models that cost less than $10 â the Raspberry Pi Zero models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never really thought about Raspberry Pi stores. But the introduction video makes a strong case in favor of such a store. The product lineup is getting a bit complicated and itâs always good to be able to talk to someone about your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the foundation can use this store as a showcase for some cool examples. You can also buy goodies, such as mugs and plushy toys. The white-and-red keyboard and mouse look cool, too.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Undercover spy exposed in NYC was one of many</title>
<link>https://apnews.com/a1d1af4256c04cc5a36347667e966a14</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://apnews.com/a1d1af4256c04cc5a36347667e966a14</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON (AP) â When mysterious operatives lured two cybersecurity researchers to meetings at luxury hotels over the past two months, it was an apparent bid to discredit their research about an Israeli company that makes smartphone hacking technology used by some governments to spy on their citizens. The Associated Press has now learned of similar undercover efforts targeting at least four other individuals who have raised questions about the use of the Israeli firmâs spyware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four others targeted by operatives include three lawyers involved in related lawsuits in Israel and Cyprus alleging that the company, the NSO Group, sold its spyware to governments with questionable human rights records. The fourth is a London-based journalist who has covered the litigation. Two of them â the journalist and a Cyprus-based lawyer â were secretly recorded meeting the undercover operatives; footage of them was broadcast on Israeli television just as the AP was preparing to publish this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All six of the people who were targeted said they believe the operatives were part of a coordinated effort to discredit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âThereâs somebody whoâs really interested in sabotaging the case,â said one of the targets, Mazen Masri, who teaches at City University, London and is advising the plaintiffsâ attorney in the case in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masri said the operatives were âlooking for dirt and irrelevant information about people involved.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of these covert efforts offer a glimpse into the sometimes shadowy world of private investigators, which includes some operatives who go beyond gathering information and instead act as provocateurs. The targets told the AP that the covert agents tried to goad them into making racist and anti-Israel remarks or revealing sensitive information about their work in connection with the lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSO has previously said it has nothing to do with the undercover efforts âeither directly or indirectly.â It did not return repeated messages asking about the new targets identified by the AP. American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which owns NSO, did not return a message from the AP seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undercover operativesâ activities might never have been made public had it not been for two researchers who work at Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog group that is based out of the University of Torontoâs Munk School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, one of the researchers, John Scott-Railton, realized that a colleague had been tricked into meeting an operative at a Toronto hotel, then questioned about his work on NSO. When a second operative calling himself Michel Lambert approached Scott-Railton to arrange a similar meeting at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, Scott-Railton devised a sting operation, inviting AP journalists to interrupt the lunch and videotape the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story drew wide attention in Israel. Within days, Israeli investigative television show Uvda and The New York Times identified Lambert as Aharon Almog-Assouline, a former Israeli security official living in the plush Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, Scott-Railton and the AP had determined the undercover efforts went well beyond Citizen Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours of the storyâs publication, Masri wrote to the AP to say that he and Alaa Mahajna, who is pursuing the lawsuit against NSO in Israel, had spent weeks parrying offers from two wealthy-sounding executives who had contacted them with lucrative offers of work and insistent requests to meet in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âWe were on our guard and did not take the bait,â Masri wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masriâs revelation prompted a flurry of messages to others tied to litigation involving NSO. Masri and Scott-Railton say they discovered that Christiana Markou, a lawyer representing plaintiffs in a related lawsuit against NSO-affiliated companies in Cyprus, had been flown to London for a strange meeting with someone who claimed to be a Hong Kong-based investor. Around the same time, Masri found out that a journalist who had written about NSO was also invited to a London hotel â twice â and questioned about his reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âThings are getting more interesting,â Masri wrote as the episodes emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Almog-Assouline, the undercover operative the AP exposed in New York, the covert agents who pursued the lawyers made a string of operational errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempt to ensnare Alaa Mahajna, the lead lawyer in the Israeli suit, was a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 26 he heard from a man who said his name was Marwan Al Haj and described himself as a partner at a Swedish wealth management firm called Lyndon Partners. Al Haj offered Mahajna an intriguing proposition. Al Haj said one of his clients, an ultra-rich individual with family ties to the Middle East, needed legal assistance recovering family land seized by Jewish settlers following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âI believe you may be a good fit for this challenging task,â Al Haj wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request made sense. As a human rights lawyer based in Jerusalem, Mahajna has defended Palestinian activists and others at the receiving end of the Israeli governmentâs ire. But Mahajna became suspicious as he tried to learn more about the case. Al Haj was cagey about his client and seemed unwilling to provide any paperwork, Mahajna told the AP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âNot even the basic stuff,â Mahajna said. âUsually people flood you with documents and stories.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahajna said he was unsettled when Al Haj suddenly offered him an all-expenses-paid trip to London; no one had even asked him whether the case had any hope of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âAt some point it was abundantly clear that this is not a bona fide approach,â Mahajna said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days later, Masri, the legal adviser in the Israeli lawsuit, received an email offering him a place on the advisory board of a Zurich-based company called APOL Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masri became skeptical after he checked out the companyâs website. Consulting firms typically trade on their employeesâ intelligence and skill, so Masri expected the companyâs site to prominently display the names, headshots and qualifications of its staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âHere there wasnât even a name of one human,â he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Masri turned down the position on APOLâs board, the representative whoâd contacted him â a man who called himself Cristian Ortega â pressed Masri to see him in London anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âI would consider it a privilege to have a chance to meet you in person for a friendly chat,â Ortega said in a Jan. 7 email. âNo strings attached of course.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masri said that by then he and Mahajna had come to believe that Ortega and Al Haj were fictions and that their companies were imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they didnât yet know how widespread the covert operations were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undercover agents got a little further with Christiana Markou, the lawyer who is pursuing the Cypriot case against NSO-affiliated entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her lawsuit, like Mahajnaâs, draws heavily on reports by Citizen Lab that found that NSO spyware had been used to break into the phones of the Mexican activists and journalists who are the plaintiffs in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markou told the AP she was approached over email Dec. 21 by a man who presented himself as Olivier Duffet, a partner at Hong Kong-based ENE Investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffet was ostensibly interested in inviting Markou â a leading data protection and privacy lawyer in Cyprus â to give a lecture at a conference. Markou said she proposed discussing the lecture over Skype, but he insisted on an in-person meeting in London, eventually flying her out, putting her up in a fancy hotel and chatting for a little more than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the discussion revolved around the proposed lecture â but then Duffet suddenly pivoted to the NSO case, asking her whether she felt the lawsuit was winnable and who was funding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markou said she âgave either incorrect answers or expressly refused to answerâ because she found his questions suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another target, Eyad Hamid, a London-based journalist who wrote a story about NSO, said he was also invited to a London hotel on two separate occasions to discuss his coverage of the Israeli company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purported company used in the operation targeting him was Mertens-Giraud Partners Management, which was described as a Brussels-based wealth management firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither MGP â nor any of the other companies â truly existed. The APâs searches of the Orbis database of some 300 million companies, local corporate registries and trademark repositories turned up no trace of a Swiss firm called APOL, a Swedish company called Lyndon partners, a Belgian company called Mertens-Giraud or a Hong Kong-based firm named ENE Investments. Local phone books didnât carry listings for a Zurich-based man named Cristian Ortega, a Hong Kong-based man named Olivier Duffet or anyone in Sweden bearing the name Marwan Al Haj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no hint of APOL when the AP visited its supposed office not far from Zurichâs central train station; tenants said theyâd never heard of the company. It was the same story in Hong Kong; a management representative at the Central Building, where ENE Investments was supposedly located, said he didnât know anything about the company. An AP journalist wasnât able to speak to anyone at Mertens-Giraudâs alleged office on Brusselsâ Rue des Poissoniers; the entire building was boarded up for renovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the modern office block in downtown Stockholm where Lyndon Partners claimed to have its headquarters, service manager Elias Broberger said he could find no trace of the wealth management firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âIt says they are located here,â Broberger said as he examined Lyndon Partnersâ professional-looking website. âBut we donât have them in any of our systems: not the booking system; not the member system. We donât bill them; they donât bill us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âI canât find them.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who hired the undercover agents remains unclear, but their operational and digital fingerprints suggest they are linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six operatives all began approaching their targets around the same time with individually tailored pitches. Their bogus websites followed the same patterns; all of them were hosted on Namecheap and many were bought at auction from GoDaddy and used the Israeli web design platform Wix. The formatting of the websites was similar; in at least two instances â MGP and Lyndon Partners â it was identical. Even the operativesâ email signatures were the same â consisting of three neatly packed, colorful lines consisting of a phone number, web address and email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operativesâ LinkedIn pages were similar, too, featuring men in sunglasses shot from a distance, facing away from the camera, or at unusual angles â a tactic sometimes use to frustrate facial recognition algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the indications that the undercover agents are all linked, there is no conclusive evidence who they might work for. An Israeli television channel, Channel 12, broadcast a report on Saturday claiming that an Israeli private investigation firm, Black Cube, had been investigating issues around the lawsuits against NSO. The TV channel showed secretly shot footage of the Cypriot lawyer, Markou, and the London journalist, Hamid, which matched the pairâs description of their encounters with undercover agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TV segment was critical of the lawyers suing NSO, and quoted NSO founder Shalev Hulio in an interview accusing Markou and her colleagues of pursuing the lawsuits as a âPR exercise.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSO has previously denied hiring Black Cube, and Black Cube in a letter sent last month to the AP said it was not involved in the effort to ensnare researchers at Citizen Lab. âBlack Cube had nothing to do with these alleged events,â the letter said, adding that no one acting on the companyâs behalf did either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Cube does have a possible tie to Almog-Assouline, the man who held the hotel meeting about NSO in New York. During a long-running Canadian legal battle between two private equity firms â Catalyst Capital and West Face Capital â one man caught up in the litigation said he recognized Almog-Assouline because heâd been approached by the same operative under a different identity several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âI recognized the individual, down to the accent and the anecdotes,â said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court filings, Black Cube has acknowledged dispatching agents to meet with âvarious individualsâ involved in in the private equity firmsâ feud. But itâs unclear if other investigations firms might also have done work connected to the two companiesâ legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Cube did not respond to repeated questions about whether it had ever employed Almog-Assouline. The firm previously drew international opprobrium for its unrelated work protecting the reputation of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almog-Assouline himself denied working for Black Cube when two AP reporters confronted him in New York last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has refused to answer any questions since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an AP reporter rang the door at his penthouse in Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon a week ago, a woman who identified herself as his wife said he wasnât home. When the reporter followed up with a phone call to Almog-Assouline, he said: âI have no interest in speaking to you.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aron Heller in Ramat Hasharon, Israel, David Keyton in Stockholm, Sweden, Jamey Keaten in Zurich, Vincent Yu in Hong Kong, Sylvain Plazy in Brussels, Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Meneloas Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;Related: using the addition symbol &quot;+&quot; for string concatenation was a mistake to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;Addition is commutative, string concatenation isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP&quot;&gt;But then again, it's not like developers aren't used to usurping mathematical concepts and giving them wildly different definitions (e.g. Redefining = to mean &quot;assignment&quot;, which isn't either symmetric, reflexive, transitive or substitutable)&lt;/p&gt;
