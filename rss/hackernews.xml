&lt;p&gt;The world is still reeling from the New Zealand Christchurch attacks that occurred on March 15, 2019. The deadliest act of terrorism in the country’s history left at least 50 dead and at least 50 more wounded. As news of the victims continues to trickle in, we have learned that one of the casualties of the massacre was 33-year-old Atta Elayyan, a legend of the New Zealand &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; scene who played under the nickname “crazyarab” or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;470435073d3e0635262569&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of the most interesting men in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking into Counter-Strike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elayyan, a Kuwait-born New Zealander, first discovered &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; in 2002. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/451018-Where-are-you-now?p=9063641#post9063641&quot;&gt;In his own words&lt;/a&gt;, while he never broke in with any major teams through &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;1.3 – 1.6&lt;/em&gt;, his early adoption of &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Source&lt;/em&gt; paid off. When his old clan broke up, he moved on to join a “bunch of randoms” going by the squad name NewType. The team was unknown at the time but was committed to winning. The group spent hours playing and practicing together, until they had eventually taken down all of the top Australian teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15.508532423208&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my beloved .ar clan split up, I took a stab and decided to join the new kids on the block… a bunch of ‘randoms’ who called themselves NewType. Nobody had heard of Grudge, Atvar or Supertech at this stage but these guys were insanely hell bent on winning and we spent 6-7 hours a night, every night playing Australians where we eventually toppled all of their top teams. With most of the top CSNZ players still tied up in 1.6, we were fairly unstoppable winning xLAN after xLAN and nearly every online comp we entered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Atta “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a2e1d0e2d8dbe3d0c3c0&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;” Elayyan, July 13, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewType’s short run was one of dominance in the region. A list of the team’s accolades can be found on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/258109-Newtype-Results&quot;&gt;GamePlanet&lt;/a&gt;, which documents 7 first place finishes, and 12 Top-3 finishes, out of 15 events. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/258118-Newtype-History&quot;&gt;Elayyan departed the team in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and while he wasn’t around the scene for a very long time, he was a pioneer for the region and left a lasting impression on the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life after gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the man was an excellent &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; player, Atta Elayyan had no shortage of talents. If ever there were a way to move on to an even more interesting life after spending time as a pro-gamer, Atta lived it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His decline in &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; only came as a result of focusing on final-year university exams for a degree in Computer Science. After graduating, he worked as a UX designer for FireTrust, a computer security company. Shortly after that, he started his own entrepreneurial project called Chatflow. Elayyan’s big break eventually came in 2010, when he and friend Mike Choeung got together to build &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://lazywormapps.com/&quot;&gt;Lazyworm Apps&lt;/a&gt;, a media solutions company focused on developing programs for the Windows Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazyworm went on to develop major apps like MetroTube and Tweetro+ and worked closely with large companies like Microsoft, Mediaworks, and Aramex. According to Nigel Parker, a principal software engineer at Microsoft, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nzigel/atta-elayyan-a-great-new-zealander-276bfc3e8b02&quot;&gt;MetroTube was, at one point, the most popular app on the Windows store.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elayyan was featured in a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF9lD_QxgPg&quot;&gt;September 2012 keynote on Microsoft Ignite as one of New Zealand’s top Windows app developers.&lt;/a&gt; He was also recognized by &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cio.co.nz/article/658893/atta-elayyan-cio100-leader-one-of-victims-of-christchurch-massacre/&quot;&gt;CIO100&lt;/a&gt; as “one of New Zealand’s most transformative technology and digital leaders” in both &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cio.co.nz/article/616197/cio100-2017-31-100-atta-elayyan-lwa-solutions/&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cio.co.nz/article/635193/cio100-2018-31-100-atta-elayyan-lwa-solutions/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an article for Medium, Parker spoke at length on Elayyan’s acumen as a developer, and his character as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta had that rare blend of engineering and design. His strength was understanding people and building user interfaces that worked best the way that we do. He wanted to build consumer apps that delighted people and attempted to reach as many people as possible. He didn’t want to sell users to advertisers or build platforms that prayed on people’s needs to pay for the best experiences. Instead he poured everything into the software he created, made it available for free without ads or tracking data and then invited people to pay if they liked the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Nigel Parker, Principal Software Engineer for Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parker went on to note that, despite facing failures on a regular basis, Atta stayed positive. He’d mark every milestone by taking every member of his projects out to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Christchurch’s own Clark Kent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the transition from trailblazing &lt;em&gt;CS:S&lt;/em&gt; pro to trailblazing app developer, Atta Elayyan spent a significant amount of his life on computers. But he wasn’t just your average nerd. He was just as much of a competitor physically as he was in the worlds of gaming and tech. As if his bio wasn’t already impressive enough, Elayyan was also the starting goalkeeper for the New Zealand Futsal Whites, the country’s national indoor-soccer team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_19616&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-19616&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-19616&quot; src=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Atta Elayyan was also a goalkeeper for the New Zealand national futsal team&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team.jpeg 800w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-291x194.jpeg 291w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-240x160.jpeg 240w, https://www.dailyesports.gg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Atta-Elayyan-was-a-goalkeeper-for-the-New-Zealand-national-futsal-team-81x54.jpeg 81w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;caption-attachment-19616&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Photo from FutsalPlanet (@futsalplanet97)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/newsarticle/74347&quot;&gt;New Zealand Football&lt;/a&gt;, Elayyan was a “hugely popular member of the futsal community” and competed in 19 A Internationals for the Futsal Whites organization. He was also a cornerstone of the Canterbury United Futsal Dragons team. According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/111348435/new-zealand-football-mourning-christchurch-shootings-victim-futsal-white-atta-elayyan&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a day before the attacks, Elayyan had met with Ronan Naicker, a good friend and Mainland Football’s futsal development officer, to pick up gear for the Christchurch Boys’ futsal team. Elayyan was set to coach the Christchurch Boys’ High School team at the secondary school nationals at Wellington this coming Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naicker, who himself had coached Elayyan and the Canterbury Dragons to two national championships (and a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/attaelayyan/status/541462032386514944&quot;&gt;Player of the Year award for Elayyan&lt;/a&gt;), had this to say on his friend’s tragic death:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph&quot;&gt;He tried to give back to his old school by coaching teams. Even though he didn’t have the time he still found time and he did it all for nothing. He never asked for anything in return. He was a truly exceptional human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph&quot;&gt;– Ronan Naicker, Christchurch futsal development officer for Mainland Football&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Stuff,&lt;/em&gt; he also worked with the goalkeepers for the Canterbury women’s team, who won the inaugural national league title this past February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond football, it seems Elayyan also had an avid interest in automobiles. He built a custom E30 340i V8 BMW which, according to a video posted on his own YouTube channel, won the award for Best 8 Cylinder Vehicle at a “South Islands Champs” show and shine competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A lasting impression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short time since it was discovered that Atta Elayyan was one of the 50 people murdered in the Christchurch massacre, the outpouring of support from the community has been resounding. Peers, teammates, gamers and friends alike have openly offered respects and tributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am honoured to have known Atta from our days back in 2005-2009 playing &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;. He was one of the kindest, and [friendliest members] of the [CSNZ] community. He never had a bad word to say about anyone, and in my two to three years of playing with him, I don’t remember him ever speaking in anger to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stayed with myself and my parents for the odd LAN and they found him to be a very polite and well-mannered individual. He was driven to reach his potential in all aspects of his life and also assisted others in fulfilling their potential too. I will cherish the times we spent playing together and hope to emulate your best qualities where I can. He really was the best of us in the [&lt;em&gt;CS&lt;/em&gt;] community and I will miss you brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/newsarticle/74347&quot;&gt;New Zealand Football Interim Chief Executive Andrew Pragnell had this to say:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still hard to comprehend what happened in Christchurch on Friday afternoon. On behalf of everyone at New Zealand Football our thoughts and prayers go out to anyone who has been affected by these heinous acts of violence.  My heart goes out to the futsal community. They are a very tight-knit group and this news of Atta’s death will be devastating for all involved in the game. We feel their pain and their grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a referee and he never had a bad word to say about anything. He’s just a genuine man – heart of gold, not only for his culture, but his family and the futsal community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph&quot;&gt;He was somebody you would follow. He wasn’t someone that was trying to be a leader, he just naturally was by his personality… That’s why it’s so tragic because he set an example of someone that can seamlessly integrate across a faith, a community, and religions. It was never an issue when it came to that for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great privilege to have known and played alongside such [an] incredible man. He has left a big hole in the futsal community and will be forever missed. Atta was a genuine, loyal, and committed man in every aspect of his life. He was well respected by everyone in the futsal community and you couldn’t have met a nicer man, who always made time for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/newsarticle/74347&quot;&gt;Josh Margetts, the Futsal Development Manager for New Zealand, also once played alongside Elayyan:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta was a great man and well-liked by everyone in the Futsal Whites squad and the futsal community. There are no words to sum up how we are all feeling. There is huge hole in our hearts as we come to terms with the loss of a great person and a good mate. He will be sorely missed. To Atta’s family, we are deeply sorry for your loss. We can’t imagine what you are going through, but please know we love you and we are here for you during this incredibly difficult time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta Elayyan to me was one of those people that you are lucky to meet in your lifetime. He was a genuine leader, talented designer and inspiring entrepreneur… Atta was a friend who gave so much to everyone that knew him. What he achieved in his short life is more than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He raised to the top of everything he applied his energy to, he took risks, he was unafraid of failure and he failed often, yet he was humble and believed in collaboration over competition in everything he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is [a] hole that has opened up inside me that will take time to heal but instead of hate we must stand together, encourage diversity and integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Gone, but never forgotten&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atta, an Arabic name, means &lt;em&gt;gift&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;to give&lt;/em&gt;. By every account that’s come forth about the man since his passing, Atta Elayyan lived up to his name. He gave to his community. He gave to his teammates. He gave it his all in pursuing his passions. He was a relentlessly interesting and talented man that smiled in the face of adversity and took every failure in stride. In his short time on this planet, his kindness, charisma and work ethic touched many different people from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would ever be in a position to say this however I actually owe a lot to [&lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;]. I would have never gotten into the tech industry had I not been obsessed with gaming during those years and the hours of focus, intense game play and desire to succeed has actually helped me alot in many aspects of my life. Of course, even if it was a complete waste of time, the people and friends I met during those years made it worth it &lt;img class=&quot;inlineimg&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gpforums.co.nz/skins/gpforums/images/smilies/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I tell my 17 year old self to do it again?… Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elayyan’s father was with him at the time of his death and was among the few that survived the attack. Elayyan also left behind a wife, Farah, and a two-year-old daughter, Aya.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Nvidia&amp;#039;s $99 Jetson Nano Is an AI Computer for DIY Enthusiasts</title>
<link>https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/18/nvidia-jetson-nano-ai-computer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/18/nvidia-jetson-nano-ai-computer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The kit can run Linux out of the box, and supports a raft of AI frameworks (including, of course, NVIDIA's own). It comes equipped with 4GB of RAM, gigabit Ethernet and the I/O you'd need for cameras and other attachments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price, unsurprisingly, is the main hook. While the Nano isn't nearly as powerful as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/12/nvidia-jetson-agx-xavier-robot-processor-available/&quot;&gt;higher-end Jetson models&lt;/a&gt;, it's available now at $99 for individuals and $129 for &quot;production-ready&quot; units destined for companies. That puts it within range of hobbyists, inventors and students who are willing to spend a bit more (but only a bit more) to create their own automated devices.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How we do Vue: one year later (2017)</title>
<link>https://about.gitlab.com/2017/11/09/gitlab-vue-one-year-later/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.gitlab.com/2017/11/09/gitlab-vue-one-year-later/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/20/why-we-chose-vue/&quot;&gt;we wrote about Vue&lt;/a&gt;. We've been using Vue for over a year now and life has been very good. Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lnoogn&quot;&gt;@lnoogn&lt;/a&gt; for reminding me to write this article!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our situation reminds me of a quote about Scala from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/2hw0bp/is_scala_slowly_dying/&quot;&gt;&quot;Is Scala slowly dying?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Someone once said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala people don't have time for redditing and blogging, they're busy getting crap done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is exactly what we've been doing. Like Scala, Vue works really, really well, when used properly. It turns out Vue isn't a buzzword, Vue is a workhorse. A lot of our problems have been solved, by us and others. We still have problems but, we now have a reproducible &quot;way to write Vue.&quot; We don't adopt every new idea out there, but we have changed a few things since we last spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that last post, we published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vue.html&quot;&gt;very extensive Vue style guide&lt;/a&gt;, after which Vue also put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/&quot;&gt;style guide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/issues/77#issuecomment-315834845&quot;&gt;taking inspiration from ours&lt;/a&gt;. The style guide has been updated several times as we discover better ways to write Vue. Here are some of the things we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-use-vuex&quot;&gt;Just use VueX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuex.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;VueX&lt;/a&gt; makes our lives easier. If you are writing a medium to large feature, use VueX. If it's a tiny feature, you might get away without it. We made the mistake of not using VueX for a large feature. We wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/31890&quot;&gt;multi-file editor&lt;/a&gt; (WIP) to replace our current repo file view, to allow easy editing of multiple files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/vue_2017/multi-file-editor.png&quot; alt=&quot;multi-file-editor.png&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning we did not use VueX for this feature and instead used the store pattern. The Vue docs talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/state-management.html#Simple-State-Management-from-Scratch&quot;&gt;store pattern&lt;/a&gt;, which works well when you are committed to strictly keeping to the pattern. We've found that you are better off spending your time with VueX instead. While VueX is initially more verbose, it is much more scalable, and will save you tons of time in the long run. Our mistake happened when we changed the data in multiple places. In VueX you are forced to change the data in one central place. If you don't do this, you will wind up chasing unexpected bugs around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;write-high-quality-code&quot;&gt;Write high quality code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though VueJS and VueX are both wonderful, it is still possible (as with any code) to write bad Vue code. While the code may work, your longevity and scalability may suffer. Performance can suffer. With Vue, it makes it so easy to have what seems like working, perfect code because Vue is so simple to write. Longevity problems can mean that your code initially works, but you (and others) will have a hard time trying to update the code. Performance problems might not crop up with small data sets, but will with larger ones. Code can get messy. Your code can get smelly. Yes, even with Vue, you can have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell&quot;&gt;code smell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you add something to the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; object or the &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; for Vue to keep track of, Vue will recursively walk down your data object and keep track of everything. If your data is super hierarchical and just large in general, and you are changing things often (like maybe on &lt;code&gt;mousemove&lt;/code&gt;), then you can create jank. It's not bad to have Vue observe large data sets, but just confirm that you do in fact need the data you are watching to be reactive. It's easy with Vue to just make everything reactive, when it might not need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we are very strict when anyone writes Vue code. They must &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vue.html&quot;&gt;follow our documentation&lt;/a&gt;. They must also only write Vue when it is necessary and not write it &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vue.html#when-not-to-use-vue-js&quot;&gt;when it is overkill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our new Vue code follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/flux/&quot;&gt;Flux architecture&lt;/a&gt;. VueX also follows Flux, which is part of the reason we use VueX. You can use the previously mentioned &quot;store pattern,&quot; but VueX is a better choice because it enforces all of the rules. If you go rogue, you will wind up enforcing the rules yourself, and you will probably make mistakes. The less you put on your plate, the better. A good example of a well-written Vue app is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/14303&quot;&gt;registry image list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-want-to-use-jquery-with-vue&quot;&gt;I want to use jQuery with Vue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During new development, this question kept popping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it ever OK to mix jQuery with VueJS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not talking about using &lt;a href=&quot;https://select2.org/&quot;&gt;Select2&lt;/a&gt;, which is a jQuery library. We are talking about the need to query the DOM. We had discussions about using jQuery and the following was proposed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using jQuery is OK, but only for querying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I had several discussions about using jQuery with Vue. Some had said it might be OK, but only in read-only (querying) situations. However, after doing the research, we found that it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a good idea to use jQuery with Vue. There will always be a better solution. We found that if you ever find yourself needing to query to DOM within a Vue architecture, then you are doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one were to hypothetically use jQuery for only the tiniest querying situations, one would have to quantify those situations. You should instead swear off querying the DOM when in Vue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of querying, you will find that using the &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; in combination with the server-side code is usually a much simpler answer. The server can provide validity to your data that you cannot provide on the client side. For the most part, we find that the less we have to fool with the data on the client side the better. That's not to say it's never OK to modify the data on the client side, but that it isn't usually the cleanest solution. At GitLab we use querying only to grab endpoints from the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; attribute of our main element, but we don't use jQuery, we use &lt;code&gt;el.dataset&lt;/code&gt;. At GitLab, we (the Frontend people) talk with the Backend people to ensure the structure of the data we will be consuming. In that way, both the Frontend team and the Backend team can be in control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;example-situation&quot;&gt;Example situation:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/vue_2017/issue.png&quot; alt=&quot;issue&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now render all issue comments in Vue. An example of a situation where we wanted to use jQuery was during the rewrite of the edit-the-last-user-comment feature. When someone presses that &lt;code&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; key on their keyboard from an empty new comment &lt;code&gt;textarea&lt;/code&gt; (at the very bottom of the page) we allow them to edit the last comment they created, just like in Slack. Not just the last comment, but the last comment &lt;em&gt;they created&lt;/em&gt;. We marked the last user comment in the picture in red. Of course there is a time crunch. Then someone might say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't we just do a quick solution here and fix it later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; query the DOM for this. A better solution, in this case, is to let the backend developers mark the last user comment in the JSON they return. Backend developers have direct access to the database, which means they may be able to optimize the code. Then no client-side work has to be done at all, in this case. Someone has to do the work to mark the last user comment. In this case the solution is just finding the right person for the job. Once you have that data from the server, the comment is in your &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;, ready for your easy access. You can do anything now. The world is your oyster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself querying the DOM, &quot;just this one time&quot; 😉, there is always a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-proper-vue-app&quot;&gt;The proper Vue app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Vue bundle needs one store, one service, and always has one entry point. Your entry point component is the only container component and every other component is presentational. All this information is in our Vue docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start out with a single &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--HAML--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
.js-vue-app{ data: { endpoint: 'foo' }}

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--HTML--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;js-vue-app&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data-endpoint=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pass your endpoints in through the data attributes. Vue can then call these endpoints with an HTTP client of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't want to do any URL building in client-side JavaScript. Make sure you pass in all your server-built URLs through endpoints. When writing Vue it's important to let the server do what it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;improve-performance&quot;&gt;Improve performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently rewrote our issue comments in Vue. The issue comments were previously written in Haml, jQuery, and Rails. We had a bottleneck because we were not loading the comments asynchronously. A quick solution is to load comments via ajax and populate comments after the page loads. One way to make a page load faster is to not block the page with heavy items and load them after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/vue_2017/comments.png&quot; alt=&quot;comments.png&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we love is that one day we turned on the new comments and some people didn't know that we had refactored it. As a result of the refactor our issue pages load much faster, and there is less jank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loading the comments on the issue page is now streamlined and now individual issues load much faster. In the past, an issue page could have tens of thousands of event listeners. Our previous code was not properly removing and keeping track of event listeners. Those massive event listeners (along with other problems) created jank, so scrolling the page was choppy with many comments. We removed jQuery and added in Vue and focused on improving the performance. You can clearly see and feel that the page is much faster. However, our work to improve the performance has just begun. This rewrite sets the foundation for performance improvements that are easier to write, because the code is much more maintainable. Previously the code was hard to maintain. Now the issue comments code is properly separated and &quot;componentized.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these new improvements, as well as other parallel improvements, e.g. loading images on scroll, we were able to make the page load and perform faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/vue_2017/speed.png&quot; alt=&quot;speed.png&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refactoring is that word that a new, super-green developer mentions on day one when they suggest to rewrite everything in Angular. That hasn't happened at GitLab. Our frontend devs tend to be very conservative, which is a very good thing. Which begs the question, why does it seems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/community/blog/#reason-3&quot;&gt;everyone is always refactoring&lt;/a&gt;? What are they trying to achieve? I can only speak for GitLab. What do we want to achieve with a refactor? In reality it's going to cost a lot of money. The costs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost of doing the refactoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of testing the change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of updating tests and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also have more risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk of introducing bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of taking on a huge task that you can't finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk of not achieving the quality/improvements you intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal #1&lt;/strong&gt;: Make the code more maintainable. We want to make the process of adding new features easier. In the long term this refactor will save us time, but it takes a significant amount of time to recoup the time spent refactoring. The hard truth may be that a refactor usually does not save you time, but can save you stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal #2&lt;/strong&gt;: What it can do, if done right, is make developers happy. Nothing gives your team more horsepower than a happy, excited coder. A stressed-out coder will want to stop coding; an excited coder will not want to stop. A happy coder saves the most time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet our goal our next step is to refactor the merge request comments section. Our merge request comments are massively slow for merge requests with lots of comments. The comments become slower and start to be less responsive at around 200 comments. The diffs are slow as well. There are a ton of reasons for this, one of which is that JavaScript is causing multiple reflows that take tons of time. We could refactor this and have already put in a fix, but this isn't a long-term solution. In the case of a huge MR, there was code that was causing a reflow that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/39332&quot;&gt;takes over eight seconds&lt;/a&gt;! This is now fixed. In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/uploads/e18856a1544d4d0e6420d11fd0479af7/ss__2017-10-20_at_1.41.04_PM.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; you can see there is other stuff slowing things down. Clearly there is a lot of work to do here. Our biggest problem is that the code is not maintainable, which means that fixes take longer. A refactor into Vue will provide some great initial speed improvements, and lay the groundwork for easier improvements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much work to do at GitLab. If you want to be a part of exploring the massive catacombs of GitLab and writing awesome code and if you are interested in helping out our Frontend team, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/frontend-engineer/&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Eliminating Robocalls</title>
<link>https://www.twilio.com/blog/your-phone-your-call-eliminating-robocalls</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.twilio.com/blog/your-phone-your-call-eliminating-robocalls</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us have had the experience. A meeting or a dinner interrupted by our phone ringing with some random number on the screen. Click ‘ignore’. Maybe a minute later we get the notification of a new voicemail (maybe in another language) touting a new deal on satellite TV, or better yet, alerting you to an urgent &quot;lawsuit from the cops.&quot; Or rather, they don't leave a voicemail at all... because they'll just robocall you again in 20 minutes, hoping you'll answer from a different random number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? If your experience is anything like mine, your &quot;missed calls&quot; screen looks a bit like mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;One day&amp;amp;#39;s worth of unknown callers.&quot; class=&quot;richtext-image left&quot; height=&quot;1082&quot; sizes=&quot;500px&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.twilio.prod.twilio-docs/images/VY0sh8Abc7IhPGBp1Z5D_dja_Sn9D5pbrneh5OdrXzemHe.width-500.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.twilio.prod.twilio-docs/images/VY0sh8Abc7IhPGBp1Z5D_dja_Sn9D5pbrneh5OdrXzemHe.width-500.png 500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.twilio.prod.twilio-docs/images/VY0sh8Abc7IhPGBp1Z5D_dja_Sn9D5pbrneh5OdrXzemH.width-1000.png 739w&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Literally my missed calls screen. Yours too?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;197.03282889919&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robocalling has reached epic proportions and we're all starting to hate our phones. In fact, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://firstorion.com/nearly-50-of-u-s-mobile-traffic-will-be-scam-calls-by-2019/&quot;&gt;First Orion&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 50% of all US mobile calls made in 2019 are expected to be robocalls. Stop and think about that for a second: half of all calls are unwanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the pervasiveness of robocalling has exploded in the last year, folks have asked me my thoughts, and frankly, whether Twilio allows this with our platform. &lt;strong&gt;We don't&lt;/strong&gt;, and I'm as concerned as you are about robocalling. We don't want these robocallers on our platform, and we actively work to prevent these perpetrators from making unwanted calls using our product. Yet a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=robocall&quot;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; will show plenty of companies actually advertising their robocalling services!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly something must be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it so bad?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause started over a century ago…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the first US telephone services were created around the turn of the 20th century, one company, the Bell Telephone Company (later rebranded AT&amp;amp;T) not only built and operated the network but also every device attached to the network. In that world, trust wasn't an issue because every device was sanctioned by the same company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that started to change in 1956 when the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the network needed to be open, forcing AT&amp;amp;T to allow 3rd party devices on the network. And thus began the trend toward more open communications. In 1968, AT&amp;amp;T was ordered by the FCC to allow 3rd party phones to attach to their network. In 1982, the DOJ split AT&amp;amp;T into multiple competitive companies. Fourteen years later, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 made communications even more competitive enabling the creation of competitive local carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each step, consumers have generally received better service and lower prices through increased competition. So what's the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That original network, designed in the first half of the 20th century, was built and operated by one company. Any actor on the network was automatically and fundamentally trusted. That meant that little security was built into the network itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with all the breakups and competitive tides the network became more open. However, the underlying protocols – and trust – were fundamentally based on a 100-year-old model. There was no way to anticipate the technological advances that would dramatically change everything about telecommunications in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roll ahead to 2019: if you have the right access, hardware and/or software -- you can initiate a call on the network, from any phone number, to any phone number in a (pretty much) untraceable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vrrrrrrp? &lt;em&gt;Record screech.&lt;/em&gt; What?!? That's right… anybody can impersonate anybody else on the phone network to make a phone call. (Yeah, I was surprised to learn that too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Twilio’s Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started Twilio in 2008, I was a software developer who knew nothing about telephony. We realized that software developers like ourselves needed to build communications into apps -- so we started down the path of figuring out how to make a phone ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a software and web developer raised with the Internet as my development background, I had certain assumptions about how trust and security work on networks: boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks, separation between layers of the stack, and so forth. And, I have to admit, when we first started learning about how telephony worked I was amazed at what the network would permit you to do. It seemed like absolute, utter, chaos, mitigated largely by good intentions. So we built a number of protections into Twilio's products to close what seemed like security holes you could drive a &lt;code&gt;${large_wheeled_vehicle}&lt;/code&gt; through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We require you to confirm ownership of a phone number before you are allowed to use it as &quot;caller-id&quot; when initiating a phone call via our APIs. By default, we bill by the minute, not the second, to deter short duration calls and impair the economics of robocalls. We’ve also built fraud protections into our product, such as geographic permissions that disable calls to high fraud destinations which are rarely used for legitimate use-cases. We also have default throughput limits, so an organization that just signed up yesterday can’t place a high volume of calls or send a high volume of messages immediately. All of these safeguards (and more) are features we added to prevent malicious actors from using Twilio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is on top of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/legal/aup&quot;&gt;Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt;, which expressly prohibits &quot;using the Twilio Services in connection with unsolicited, unwanted or harassing communications (commercial or otherwise), including, but not limited to, phone calls, SMS or MMS messages, chat, voice mail, video or faxes.&quot; We use artificial intelligence and other instrumentation to look for patterns that might indicate abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are many competitive local carriers who have access to the telephony network, both inside the United States and outside. And in a world of untrusted devices plugging into a trusted network, it takes just a small handful of bad actors engaging in shenanigans to ruin the network for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your Phone, Your Call.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the next step is to put you back in control of your phone, where the communications industry provides the tools for you to receive only wanted communications from trusted parties. You’ll see a cryptographically signed caller-id asserting the company or person who's initiating a call to you is who they claim to be. In addition, ideally, your phone will only ring if a caller's reputation is up to par. To achieve this vision, illegal spoofing needs to be eliminated and a strong notion of identity needs to be established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unlike the status of email, circa 2002. Back then, you could send an email as anybody -- you just put their address in the &lt;code&gt;From:&lt;/code&gt; field, and your mail server delivered it. It's true, a friend didn't believe me back in 2000, so I sent him an email from &quot;bgates@microsoft.com&quot; and he was blown away -- what a hacker I was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the industry realized this situation wasn't sustainable and email spam was growing. So some smart people came up with some smart solutions to cryptographically sign emails and specify allowed IP addresses to send on behalf of a domain: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail&quot;&gt;DKIM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework&quot;&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-spam technology within email has continued to evolve to address the emerging problems of phishing and other malicious attacks. DMARC is a DNS-based policy allowing domain owners sending email to give a set of instructions to receiving domains on how to treat email that fails either SPF or DKIM. As a result, the amount of spam we receive today is a tiny fraction of what we got 15 years ago and companies have ways to protect their reputations and their customers from malicious actors trying to impersonate legitimate businesses for nefarious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For phone calls, there's some good news. Some very smart people have been working on new ways of cryptographically signing calls – a digital signature – proving ownership of a phone number before the call is initiated. One example of this is a new protocol called STIR/SHAKEN, which the communications ecosystem is working on now. Before any authentication method can be impactful at scale, it needs to be adopted by a broad swath of the ecosystem. Twilio is fully committed to efforts to authenticate calls so the identity of callers can be proven, and it looks like STIR/SHAKEN is a good candidate to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you know the identity of the caller, what should you do about it? That’s where reputation comes into play. Once you know the caller isn’t pretending to be someone they aren’t, how do you (or a system working on your behalf) decide if your phone should ring, or if you should answer it? This is the next challenge, and so we'll explore identity and reputation in our next post...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Phone, Your Call - Part II - Why did we have caller ID in the 90s but not today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff Lawson is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Twilio. He's focused on restoring trust in the communications we rely on everyday so that you can answer your phone again. He can be reached on Twitter at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffiel&quot;&gt;@jeffiel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU government websites have undisclosed adtech trackers from Google and others</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/18/cookie_government_tracking_report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/18/cookie_government_tracking_report/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;All but three of the European Union member states' government websites are littered with undisclosed adtech trackers from Google and other firms, with many piggy-backing on third-party scripts, according to an analysis of almost 200,000 webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cookiebot.com/media/1121/cookiebot-report-2019-medium-size.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), published today by Cookiebot in collaboration with civil rights association European Digital Rights (EDRi), scanned 184,683 EU government webpages on 11 and 12 March to assess the cookies on each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It found that there were 112 companies slurping up information on EU citizens' browsing habits on the webpages of the governments supposedly fighting the good fight against excess stalking of netizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adtech trackers were found on 25 of the 28 member states' sites, with only Spain, Germany and the Netherlands clean of commercial cookies. There were 52 companies identified on France's government sites, 27 on Latvia's and 19 on Belgium's. Twenty cookies were &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uz5lrz5bqglracj/AAD9s8fzdpZem1KE-1KvNKqFa/UK?dl=0&amp;amp;subfolder_nav_tracking=1&quot;&gt;identified on GOV.UK&lt;/a&gt;, of which 12 were marketing, and all belonged to one company – Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the search giant is described as the &quot;kingpin of tracking&quot; within the report, present on 82 per cent of all the sites and accounting for three of the top five trackers: YouTube, DoubleClick and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report authors said this was of &quot;special concern&quot; because Google can cross-reference trackers with its first-party account details via its widely used consumer services such as Mail, Search and Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the work assessed public health service sites, again finding that cookies were widespread, with 52 per cent of those tested having commercial trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again, Google was right up there, making up two of the top five, with the others being Adobe's eversttech.net, AppNexus' adnxs.com and Mediamath's Mathtag.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this assessment, the researchers chose six EU countries and carried out 15 health-related search queries – such as &quot;How do I know if I have HIV?&quot;, &quot;Signs of being an alcoholic&quot; and &quot;I want to terminate my pregnancy&quot; – from IP addresses in each country to identify the relevant landing pages on each nation's health service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, some 60 per cent of these landing pages had such ad trackers, less only than Irish sites, where trackers appeared on 73 per cent of landing pages. A single German website about maternity leave was monitored by 63 companies, while a French page about abortion was tracked by 21 firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group said this could be used to &quot;infer sensitive facts about [users'] health condition and life situation&quot; and be resold to target ads. &quot;These citizens have no clear way to prevent this leakage, understand where their data is sent, or to correct or delete the data,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent of tracking on these sites is even more alarming, the report argued, because they don't rely on ad revenue. In some cases, governments will want to use companies' services, but in others the firms gained access to these non-commercial sites through &quot;free&quot; third-party JavaScript tech services, like share buttons or plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These scripts can act as Trojan horses, opening backdoors to the website code through which ad tech companies can silently insert their trackers,&quot; the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It urged website owners to be more careful when including third-party components on their sites; to make sure they had a detailed overview of the current trackers; and to remove any unwanted ones from the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors should also be offered full transparency and control over trackers on the site – but it shouldn't just be up to users to lock down their browsing habits. Stronger regulations need to be in force, and adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can any organisation live up to its [European General Data Protection Regulation] GDPR and ePrivacy obligations if it does not control unauthorised tracking actors accessing their website?&quot; asked Cookiebot founder Daniel Johannsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Public sector bodies now have the opportunity to lead by example – at a minimum by shutting down any digital rights infringements that they are facilitating on their own websites.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diego Naranjo at EDRi used the opportunity to lament the delay to the long-awaited &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/11/european_parliament_eprivacy_rapporteur_birgit_sippel_interview/&quot;&gt;ePrivacy Regulation&lt;/a&gt;, which was initially meant to be enforced as the yin to the GDPR's yang, covering communications data rather than personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it has been &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/02/2019_eprivacy_brexit/&quot;&gt;stuck in discussions&lt;/a&gt; between member states for more than a year, and privacy activists fear it is being watered down as a result of lobbying from adtech industry and concerns among member states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it does lose ground, Naranjo warned, it will &quot;open a Pandora's box of more and more sharing, merging and reselling of personal data in huge online commercial surveillance networks, in which citizens are being unwittingly tracked and micro-targeted with commercial and political manipulation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their calls for progress echo those made by the European Data Protection Board last week. The group – made up of the bloc's data protection watchdogs and EU data protection supervisor – issued a statement urging legislators to &quot;intensify efforts&quot; to adopt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The future ePrivacy Regulation should under no circumstance lower the level of protection offered by the current ePrivacy Directive and should complement the GDPR by providing additional strong guarantees for all types of electronic communications,&quot; it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2019/european-data-protection-board-eighth-plenary-session-interplay-eprivacy-directive_en&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. ®&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;I am currently working for a startup and am one of 3 developers. Most of my work revolves around building the API in Node + Express as well as some small projects with MongoDB. The other developers don't really assist me since they have their own projects to work on, and, honestly, they have less experience and knowledge than I do.
&lt;p&gt;So my question is: What is the best way for me to go about learning best practices in API development, or using MongoDB, or even just being a better software developer in general?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

=====  Configuration advices  =====
-----  backup  -----
Configure your wal_level to a level which allow PITR backup and recovery
-----  checkpoint  -----
Your checkpoint completion target is too low. Put something nearest from 0.8/0.9 to balance your writes better during the checkpoint interval
-----  extension  -----
Enable pg_stat_statements to collect statistics on all queries (not only queries longer than log_min_duration_statement in logs)
-----  index  -----
You have unused indexes in the database since last statistics. Please remove them if they are never use
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Install it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;need perl with module &lt;code&gt;DBD::Pg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Debian or derivated :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Fedora or deriavated :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;yum install perl-DBD-Pg
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On MacOS with Homebrew:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew install perl
cpan DBD-pg
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wget -O postgresqltuner.pl postgresqltuner.pl
wget -O postgresqltuner.pl https://postgresqltuner.pl
curl -o postgresqltuner.pl postgresqltuner.pl
curl -o postgresqltuner.pl https://postgresqltuner.pl
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add permissions :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;chmod +x postgresqltuner.pl
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And run script :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Via network :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;postgresqltuner.pl --host=dbhost --database=testdb --user=username --password=qwerty
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Via unix socket as postgres sytem user :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;postgres$ postgresqltuner.pl --host=/var/run/postgresql  # PostgreSQL socket directory
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If available postgresqltuner.pl will use standard PostgreSQL variables like &lt;code&gt;PGHOST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PGPORT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PGDATABASE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PGUSERNAME&lt;/code&gt;, and password from &lt;code&gt;~/.pgpass&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;With docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Via network :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker run -it --rm jfcoz/postgresqltuner --host=dbhost --user=username --password=pass --database=testdb
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Via network with ssh access :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh jfcoz/postgresqltuner --host=dbhost --user=username --password=pass --database=testdb
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Via docker link :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker run -it --rm --link your-postgresql-container:dbhost jfcoz/postgresqltuner --host=dbhost --user=username --password=pass --database=testdb
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SSH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using it remotly, postgresqltuner.pl will use ssh to collect OS informations. You must configure ssh to connect to remote host with private key authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add options to ssh via two ways :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;--sshopt=Port=2200 --sshopt=IdentityFile=...
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure your SSH client via ~/.ssh/config :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Host my-database-host
        IdentityFile=...
        Port=2200
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better security use a &lt;code&gt;~/.pgpass&lt;/code&gt; file containing passwords, so password will not be saved in the shell history nor in the process list. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;.pgpass documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;host:port:database:username:password
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Average number of work_mem buffer per connection :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A query can use many work_mem buffers depending on the query complexity. You can configure the average number of work_mem buffers per connection (in percent):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;--wmp 300
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default in 150%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SSD Disks :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running in an hypervisor with SSD disks, detection is not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;--ssd
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow to specify that disks are SSD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/3/18/two-years-at-stripe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; two years ago to make starting an Internet business easier, mostly by work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. After founding four small software companies I wanted peers to deal with less nonsense, either by productizing a solution to it or by writing up the things I wish I had known back in 2006 when I started. In the same spirit, here’s what I didn’t know prior to joining Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it-you-do-anyway&quot;&gt;What is it you do, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe’s mission is increasing the GDP of the Internet. Mine is increasing the number of successful software companies on it. That is basically the entirety of the job description. On a day-to-day basis, it’s very Choose Your Own Adventure; I’ve written code, requirements documents, strategy memos, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas guides&lt;/a&gt; and advised Stripe employees, partners, and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is… not a straightforward thing to write on a business card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it gives me huge amounts of latitude to determine my day-to-day direction, and makes use of having a wide skillset. Relatively few people can solo ship an initiative which requires copywriting, React, an ETL pipeline, and a business negotiation; it turns out that is pretty valuable and decreasing the time-to-market of it (versus having to spin up a team of five people to do the same work) is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are reasons why job descriptions exist; they help communicate one’s position to others at the company, clarify discussions about dependency graphs, give decisionmakers a handle when plans are made, etc etc. Being the singleton instance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Stripe::Atlas::Patio11&lt;/code&gt; is occasionally a mixed blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-else-do-you-do&quot;&gt;What else do you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from “continuing to be my usual (hopefully) helpful self on the Internet,” I also try to contribute outside my formal role. One of the things I enjoy most about Stripe’s work culture is the notion that “nothing is Not My Job.” My first real pull request at Stripe was fixing a security bug; I was quite happy to learn that they meant what they had said in spinup about that, and that the Security team spent time getting my code up to scratch even though I looked like “random business (?) guy at the Japan office” in the company directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe touches a &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; large subset of human endeavor (basically, “just the things that involve money”). We operate at a scale which is both tiny relative to commerce on the Internet (which is, itself, nowhere near its asymptote yet) and yet already very material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite projects have been ruining bad guys’ days. Our users have a lot of money flowing through us daily; every bad guy on the Internet wants it; we are in a constant footrace with all of them. There are a lot of smart people who work all day every day to frustrate them; I have been able to help a time or ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example: we had an internal red-team exercise run as a contest: figure out how to steal All The Money, bonus points if one would probably get away with it. Folks across the company did security research and wrote up their findings; responsible teams then got oodles of high-quality fodder for remediation without us having actually lost a dollar. I won the contest with a few dozen submissions. We closed classes of vulnerabilities as a consequence of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various efforts here (security, risk management, etc) benefit quite a bit from understanding what is technically possible, being able to implement it quickly, and having a good mental model for business in the small (“What’s normal behavior for an Internet-based software business?”) and the large (“Where are the weak points in global financial infrastructure, and how do we manage our exposure to them?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also pitch in on (depending on the day) product strategy, writing, company culture building, organizational issues, supporting the Japan team, engineering recruiting, advising Stripe customers (often, very literally, to charge more), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-work-at-stripe-when-you-could-run-your-own-business&quot;&gt;Why work at Stripe when you could run your own business?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;leverage_aside&quot;&gt;Leverage means things which increase your capability to provide impact. For example, writing code is an extremely leveraged use of your time; you go off to continue living your life but your code keeps running. Some leveraged things I've done are writing, writing software, making businesses which employed people other than me, and joining forces with smart people to work on the problems I seek to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran my own businesses for a number of years, including a startup with co-founders, and greatly enjoyed the experience, but I felt like I was maxing out on the challenges available in running small software companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also felt like it was constraining the absolute amount of impact I had for the world. The parts of the job which I enjoyed the most were not my actual job (writing and selling software, filing taxes in a timely fashion, etc) but helping other software entrepreneurs optimize their businesses or engineers navigate career challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevinakwok&quot;&gt;Kevin Kwok&lt;/a&gt; asked “Leverage on what?”. Fifteen years into this career thing I definitely know what my success function for the next thirty is: the product of the number of people I’ve helped in the community I serve (software people, broadly writ) times the delta in the average life that my efforts uniquely caused. If one uses e.g. income as a metric because it’s crunchy enough to keep one honest, then the most effective thing I’ve ever done (by &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; on an ROI-on-time basis) was writing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/&quot;&gt;salary negotiation for engineers&lt;/a&gt;. A few hundred folks have emailed me the outcomes they attribute to that essay; this lower-bounds the impact to score of that essay at about 7,000,000 (a year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe offers a much larger platform to scalably educate and advise entrepreneurs from, and unlike my own companies, it structurally benefits directly from doing that. (There were some indirect benefits to e.g. Bingo Card Creator from me writing a few million words, but Stripe benefits &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; from every artifact we produce which makes N businesses more successful at the margin. The company-level mission is “Increase the GDP of the Internet”; every time we increase the pace of business formation, the likelihood of business survival, or the rate of business growth, we win.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of my professional output over the past 12 years has been making businesses ~1% better and repeating that. This was an interesting game to play for Bingo Card Creator, but it was a lot more lucrative when doing it for consulting clients. Stripe’s scale allows some decisions to be &lt;em&gt;quite leveraged indeed&lt;/em&gt;, both directly and at our customers’ businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(An example which is just a &lt;em&gt;boggling&lt;/em&gt; fact about the world: what’s your finger-to-a-wind guesstimate about what percentage of credit card payments fail with error code I Don’t Know Sometimes Things Fail In Credit Card Land? Hint: it’s higher than you think. Those failed payments cost conversions at the margin. When Stripe fights that number down by &lt;em&gt;a basis point&lt;/em&gt;, that creates value across our entire portfolio, forever.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe’s network is far wider than mine, and where appropriate, I can trade on our organizational karma. This lets me do things which require collaboration from folks who I probably couldn’t just call in my personal capacity. An example: I can probably speculate my fingers off in HN comments about how to pitch an investor, but as a Stripe, I can collaborate directly with YC on optimizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/pitching&quot;&gt;the advice&lt;/a&gt; to their partners’ true desiderata in looking at companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of time I’ve spent on low-value business administration has declined from about 10~20% of my week (really!) to functionally zero. A surprising portion of running my own businesses was contract negotiation, making sure vendors got paid, and wiring profits in time to make rent. We have people who specialize in all those things so I no longer have to. (I miss getting woken up because a server had… just kidding, I do not miss that at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage has a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cost is that organizations eventually reach a point where “Just get a bunch of smart people in the room and let them do whatever” ceases to cause spontaneous order and begins to cause chaos. We’re well past that point. This means that we need some sort of planning and managerial processes, and while I interact quirkily with them I do interact materially with them. That interaction is an overhead on personal productivity. It isn’t a small overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for leverage also means occasionally having to pick projects other than the ones I’d want to do ceteris paribus. Stripe would probably &lt;em&gt;let&lt;/em&gt; me just lock myself in a room and write for N years, but that would likely greatly underperform the theoretical limit on impact, so I sometimes end up doing work which is more pressing for the company but less personally fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I occasionally miss doing my own thing? Yep, on at least a monthly basis, most particularly when working with entrepreneurs directly. I don’t have nearly the bandwidth to prototype anything material but I feel the siren call of it; I’m pretty sure my next adventure will be running a software business again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; feel as if being at Stripe has increased my aspirations with regards to that next business. Partly this is via exposure to a wide variety of companies in the ecosystem; entrepreneurs’ creativity never ceases to amaze me. (All else being equal, &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; choose a customer base whose creative use of what you build will surprise and delight you.) I’ve also had some time to crawl around the ducts of Internet commerce, which is a beautiful fractal described by an equation capable of summoning horrors from beyond spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the single biggest change in belief I’ve had since joining is that ambition properly harnessed can be an enormously productive force in the world. This is largely informed by working with people who are extremely ambitious and yet well-grounded, both at Stripe and at our customers. There is a great, great difference between “Build a credit card processor? That’s &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;.” and “Build a credit card processor? That probably involves compliance with an enumerable set of regulations and writing a finite number of lines of code.” You want more people in your life who say the second version, probably at most margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, I think I agree with Tyler Cowen that &lt;a href=&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/10/high-return-activity-raising-others-aspirations.html&quot;&gt;raising others’ aspirations&lt;/a&gt; is an effective way to increase productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that Silicon Valley does this at scale is creating a space in the culture for being just a little bit wild-eyed when envisioning potential impact and then, this is important, actually shipping tractable engineering artifacts against the vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often poked fun of when it is deployed in the service of ends people view as unserious or when done by folks who confabulate. I have probably made jokes like that before. I think I have come to regret them, because they’re &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; heard by people with serious goals who are scrupulous. The jokes, and the broader culture, discourage those people from trying extraordinarily ambitious things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I got a do-over on e.g. running my own businesses for a decade, I’d probably skip the relatively unambitious first two (which I did just because I knew I could probably do them) and proceed directly to trying things outside of my comfort zone. (I still have an enormous love in my heart for the aesthetics of small software businesses, but given a do-over, could have done much more interesting and impactful small software businesses earlier than I actually did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can simultaneously hold two thoughts at once: that unserious ends and lies are not positive, but that we probably underestimate the number of teams doing very important work in a startup-y fashion. They’re on-paper unqualified, they are often running on a shoestring, they don’t look like who Hollywood would cast as Obviously Important Person, and yet they &lt;em&gt;often outperform anyway&lt;/em&gt;. One of the best parts of my job is getting to help folks like this build their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s probably the single biggest revelation to me 15 years into my career, so, throwing it back in a bottle for any of y’all who are getting started. We might not have time travel yet, but the Internet is the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-a-senior-individual-contributor&quot;&gt;Being a senior individual contributor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat surprisingly to some folks who know me externally, I am not a manager (of Stripe Atlas or anything else). I’m an IC (“individual contributor”, a bit of widely-used jargon at companies large enough to have career tracks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in their careers, ICs mostly create value by doing “the work.” In one’s first year of e.g. being an IC engineer, you write code backing projects of varying complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one increases up the skill curve, ICs continue doing “the work” while also spending an increasing amount of time on non-managerial metawork, like contributing in a directed fashion to the organizational culture, setting strategic directions, mentoring others (including managers), setting up systems and processes by which the work will be done in the future, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe has an explicit career path available to ICs in engineering and elsewhere. It is designed to avoid the relatively industry common failure mode that, as one advances in one’s career, one either has to start doing management or compromise quite a bit on career impact and outcomes. Management is a useful professional specialization but you probably shouldn’t do it if other specializations are more highly leveraged uses of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great sources of leverage is other people. You can get leverage via directing folks to do things (a superpower whose impact I probably underappreciated when running my business solo). You can also get it by making them more effective at doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I work with folks at Stripe, I try to make them more instrumentally effective at working the organization, at understanding the broader business context for individual units of work, at understanding the startup ecosystem and the mindset and challenges of our users, etc. For folks in particularly focused roles, I try to put in place efforts to make them better at the core content of their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I write a lot at Stripe, but Stripe now has a number of people for whom that statement is true. I could plausibly ship X00,000 words in a year, but one eventually hits a plateau there; there is no plateau if the shippable thing is making other writers more instrumentally effective. This sometimes come from directly editing work but more often from teaching, sometimes about the craft of writing specifically and sometimes more Stripe-specific nuances like how to reproduce the company voice. (I also wrote a non-trivial amount of code because, fun fact, stripe.com spells CMS e-r-b, which didn’t optimize for writers’ ability to ship new words.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague Julia Evans has an essay on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/blog/senior-engineer/&quot;&gt;being a senior engineer&lt;/a&gt; which discusses being a senior IC in a lot of detail specific to engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sidenote: One way to substantial impact as a senior IC is providing an example of what senior IC-ship looks like for folks growing in their careers to aspire to; another is working with people explicitly to accelerate their growth towards it and beyond.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-writing-writing&quot;&gt;Writing, writing, writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe is a celebration of the written word which happens to be incorporated in the state of Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We produce prodigious amounts of it internally, most of it widely visible within the company. My favorite job perk might be that library; it includes everything from a crackling memo about current state of book publishing (relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.stripe.com&quot;&gt;our interests&lt;/a&gt;) to experiment writeups about using machine learning to counter credit card fraud (relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/radar&quot;&gt;our interests&lt;/a&gt;) to market analyses of SaaS adoption in Japanese businesses (relevant to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/billing&quot;&gt;our interests&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected to write a shedload at Stripe, and I do. I didn’t expect most of it to be internally facing. Example: we have a lot more people at Stripe who need to know how to reason about a SaaS business than who have run SaaS businesses, so I locked myself in a room and data dumped about what I had learned in ten years. (We eventually published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas&quot;&gt;publicly available version&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I once had the typical engineer’s disdain for Strategy Memos (TM), but if you think of it as less a Strategy Memo (TM) and more a pull request for a very complicated program which directs the activities of dozens or hundreds of people, it gets a lot easier to stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote about where Stripe is in Japan right now, what it would take for Stripe to be as impactful to the Japanese Internet as it has been to the US Internet, and what concrete steps we should take in 2019 to get us closer to that goal. It’s low-degree wild to me that I have something useful to contribute there, but one of the things the company does rather well is being a distributed responsibility machine. Working at BigCo counsels you that there is some expert in another castle who has already written the marching orders and all you have to do is execute your tiny assigned portion of them. At Stripe, you can order the metaphorical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=google+bezos+two+pizza+rule&quot;&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt; and say “Good news: Stripe does have smart people working on the go-to-market plan for the world’s third largest economy. We just bought them a single large pizza.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could certainly write the Strategy Memo equivalent of bikeshedding on indentation rules. Try not to do that or to work with people who enjoy doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside about indentation rules: the right way to do all stylistic arguments is to enforce them with code, and make the &lt;em&gt;sole&lt;/em&gt; supported interface for stylistic arguments pull requests against the linter/compiler rather than comments on individual engineers’ work. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;go fmt&lt;/code&gt; might be the single best feature of Golang for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Stripe, there are a lot of things which are valid Ruby which are nonetheless illegal. A trivial example would be a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@improper_casing_for_ruby&lt;/code&gt;. A more meaningful example would be calling into another team’s code from outside a defined boundary. Since a linter catches essentially all of those, if one finds oneself nitpicking a pull request, one should generally either a) fix the linter or b) find something productive to do with one’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of many, many ways that considered use of technology helps to ameliorate human problems. One of the joys of working in a tech company is that they seem to have a comparative advantage on grokking this, and on self-modifying tools to more closely fit the desired way they want to work. This is one reason I expect 2019’s employment of engineers to be the lowest number for the rest of time: every organization which cares about the social reality of work would benefit from being able to compose their own tools. (That feels like a contentious claim, but it isn’t socially contentious to say that basically every organization considers leadership to be too critical to outsource, and leadership is just programming for organizations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-very-remote&quot;&gt;Being (very) remote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe is expanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/global&quot;&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt; rapidly, but most folks who I interact with on a day-to-day basis are in San Francisco. This is occasionally challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eagerness to please, for my first year, I did not establish great boundaries around e.g. acceptable meeting times, and ended up taking a lot at, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://everytimezone.com/zones/009e62fa&quot;&gt;11 AM PST&lt;/a&gt;. After pulling out quite a bit of hair around my sleep schedule, I eventually blocked off my sleeping hours on my calendar; this was a major improvement in quality of life. These days I get up early (7 AM, generally) to have meetings, take a hard break to spend time with my kids before school, and then head into the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks ask me about work/life balance a lot. I (candidly) worry that I don’t always set a great example for my team or the office on this; I have periods which are quite crunchy interspersed by lulls, and even at a shop which doesn’t count hours or reward facetime-for-the-sake-of-facetime I find myself falling back into salaryman mode too frequently. I’m happy to report that folks who are better about self-discipline and maintaining boundaries do successfully do so at Stripe, and generally without sacrificing actual or perceived effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think, particularly as companies mature, that they should generally evolve organizational alchemy to get greater-than-sum-of-the-parts effectiveness out of people with disparate working styles, in the same way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-13/santander-didn-t-pay-its-non-debt&quot;&gt;businesses unite investors with differing tolerances for risk&lt;/a&gt; to bankroll common enterprise that no tolerance level could fully fund by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a question reasonable people can disagree on: is it OK to routinely have meetings at e.g. 7 PM? (I’m sympathetic to “Oh heck no” on this question, but note that if you want to support traditionally managed Japanese businesses that that won’t be a maximally effective response, and there are many other plausible reasons for someone to say, given their goals, values, and personal situation, “Actually, 7 PM meetings sound pretty reasonable to me. It’s not a crazy ask like e.g. showing up in an office at 9 AM, who does that.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have four people at your company, you probably need &lt;em&gt;almost total agreement&lt;/em&gt; on whether 7 PM meetings are a routine expectation. If you have 400, you can probably tolerate groups/roles/individuals/etc ending up at different equilibria on this question. Save your limited Total Agreement Mandatory points for the key differentiating values of your culture. (Stripe describes its organizational culture to candidates with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/us/jobs/candidate-info&quot;&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fly to HQ about once a quarter, mostly to “meet old friends and make new ones.” It’s simultaneously incredibly useful and a bit jarring to, every single time, be in a lunchroom which has hundreds of people who were not there the last time I was in the lunchroom. Hypergrowth is a through-the-looking-glass sort of experience, particularly when you perceive it in slices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to my team, which is the most supportive one I’ve ever been on. We added a number of new remote engineers recently, and the entire team worked from home for a week to understand the experience better and capture requirements for improving our communication norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company which seems tied to email and Slack at all working hours, it’s useful to understand that a lot of information is distributed around the lunch table and decisions get made in hallway conversations, neither of which is great for folks who can only perceive HQ through the Internet. A tiny thing someone built recently which I really love for helping on this: if you schedule a meeting between Stripes, a video conference link gets automatically added to the meeting, so that any remote employee who might need it doesn’t need to feel like they’re constantly having to interrupt meetings to remind someone to turn on the camera and distribute the link to the remotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are rather aggressively expanding the cohort of remote Stripes, driven partly by improved technologies for collaboration (Zoom, Google Docs, etc), partly by happy experiences on many teams which experimented with adding remotes, partly by desire to attract and retain talented folks wherever they may be, and partly by desire to be more local to our customers, who are very widely distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which: at 2 PM PDT on Tuesday March 19th (&lt;a href=&quot;https://everytimezone.com/s/1ad71245&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;when?&lt;/a&gt;) we’re having a remote coffee for folks interested in casually chatting about what the experience of being a remote engineer at Stripe is like. I’ll be participating along with a few engineers and engineering managers. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.events/remote-coffee&quot;&gt;request an invitation&lt;/a&gt;. This is just a casual chat between geeks, but for what it is worth, a number of people who attended the last remote coffee now work with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fast-and-slow&quot;&gt;Fast and slow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, I can’t tell you Stripe’s growth rate for anything, but let’s talk about a stylized company called 2X, Inc., where every graph is growing at 2X per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at 2X breaks so many intuitive understandings of how the world should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day you start at 2X, half of your coworkers have less than 1 year of experience. A year later, when you’re starting to get your sea legs, half of your coworkers have less than 1 year of experience. A year later, when senior colleagues start forgetting that you were not actually there during the flood, half of your coworkers have less than 1 year of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get numb to graphs after a while. Numbers flit in one ear and out the other; retaining any is almost pointless, because by the time one sinks into your consciousness it will not merely be wrong but glaringly wrong. 2X doubles every year and everyone laughs about how the planning department got it right again; it’s eerie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s exhilarating and terrifying all at once, because almost nothing in nature grows at 2X a year over sustained periods. 2X is constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to sustain the growth, but simultaneous with the hunt is the challenge of doing anything meaningful with &lt;em&gt;that graph&lt;/em&gt; as a backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe isn’t 2X, Inc., but occasionally has some challenges that this stylized company has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to write dashboards and memos for people who &lt;em&gt;aren’t at the company yet&lt;/em&gt;; most users of the artifact aren’t. You’ve got to stick up your hand in meetings and say “Hey, you just said ‘sales funnel’: can you give me the maximally pedantic explanation of what that means.” (This is a good thing for senior folks to ask, because forcing folks who joined last week to interrupt to ask a basic question doesn’t set them up for comfort or success.) You have to employ professional educators (and eventually historians and anthropologists, for real), because you effectively run a postgraduate study program on the scale of a small university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to constantly course correct your understanding of what is material impact, because hopefully you’re searching for making material impact, and things that were material three years ago might not move the needle anymore. And things that were &lt;em&gt;outlandishly&lt;/em&gt; impossible three years ago might now be quite possible, and worth doing, but only if you can get to them in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to keep the culture to fight like hell for the expansive set of things which are very worth doing but which don’t obviously move needles. One reason I fly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microconf.com&quot;&gt;MicroConf&lt;/a&gt; every year is to make sure we meet people who are hitting their first month of $1, $1k, or $10k worth of revenue and &lt;em&gt;thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; understand what they need from us. We should not just prevent degradation of the experience for them but make it transformatively better than 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-things-which-matter&quot;&gt;Creating things which matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long-time user of Stripe, as soon as I got git access, I went spelunking for where the magic behind the product pages lived. (If you’re not familiar at this: Stripe has a mostly deserved reputation for giving new product pages very well-designed treatments. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/us/billing&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; for general reference.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: There is shockingly little magic, on that topic or anywhere else. The landing pages are an ERB file which starts out blank. It spits out HTML (and some CSS and Javascript), the same as every other page on the Internet. The reason those pages are phenomenal is that a very small group of very talented people care an almost unreasonable amount that they are phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route to great work is mostly a) hire small teams of very talented people who very intently care about something and b) incentivize great work amongst numerous other competing worthy priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often phrase that as “Protect teams doing great work”, but I don’t think that is entirely correct. Mediocrity doesn’t happen because a villain kills good work then cackles maniacally. BigCo doesn’t set out to be mediocre… BigCo just has an awful lot of people with an awful lot on their plate, and many of them are incentivized to make locally-optimal decisions at the expense of competing global goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing organizational design and incentive structuring to solve the principal/agent problem internally and cause people to optimize for the global outcome at scale may be the hardest unsolved problem. (In management? In capitalism? In anything? Take your pick.) We’re working on it; concretely, it often involves making space for folks to say “What does the &lt;em&gt;best possible&lt;/em&gt; version of this project look like?” and being OK with e.g. delaying things until they are ready. (Note the implicit tension with doing that while one’s business and the environment are moving at Warp 7. None of the problems are easy, or there wouldn’t be any need to have smart people work on them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder in me thinks that a bit of experience in a large (or growing) organization is very useful for correcting one’s worldview and ability to anticipate the actions of future customers, counterparties, partners, etc at large organizations. That is a useful ability to have as a founder, and (somewhat surprisingly) we spend very little time at school teaching how large organizations actually make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are e.g. civics classes which can teach you the orthodox understanding of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0&quot;&gt;legislative process&lt;/a&gt;, but it glosses over really important details to the real world, like e.g. how the regulated directly engage with their regulators to shape future legislation. I similarly think that no class about management or capitalism I’ve ever been in said “Sometimes the reason for an outrageous result isn’t a principal/agent problem or ‘Maximize the evil’ or incompetence, it is that writing a dashboard which would have surfaced the problem in time to fix it was beyond the SQL capabilities of the most directly responsible individual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of SQL, I love our internal tooling. We have a number of engineers specifically dedicated to it; I think we could probably tolerate having five times as many as we do. Some of the things they’ve built that clearly would have helped every software company I’ve ever worked at: an easy way to automate (and thereby secure) somebody-needed-to-pop-open-a-console style tasks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/livegrep/livegrep&quot;&gt;instant code search over the entire codebase&lt;/a&gt;, and a way to subscribe oneself for daily emails about state changes to a certain set of objects (e.g. “For all the accounts I manage, email me the list of any who hit $MILESTONE every morning, so I can reach out to congratulate them.”) One of the reasons I love our tooling is that there is an engineering-driven emphasis on composability, such that each additional tool we add makes wide swathes of our tooling (and operations) more valuable, often in unanticipated ways. I cannot bang the drum enough for investing in internal tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;id-love-to-chat-more-about-this&quot;&gt;I’d love to chat more about this&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A huge fireball exploded in the Earth's atmosphere in December, according to Nasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;second largest of its kind in 30 years&lt;/a&gt;, and the biggest since the fireball over Chelyabinsk in Russia six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it went largely unnoticed until now because it blew up over the Bering Sea, off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The space rock exploded with 10 times the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindley Johnson, planetary defence officer at Nasa, told BBC News a fireball this big is only expected about two or three times every 100 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What do we know?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At about noon local time on 18 December, the asteroid barrelled through the atmosphere at a speed of 32km/s (20 miles per second) , on a steep trajectory of seven degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring several metres in size, the space rock exploded 25.6km above the Earth's surface, with an impact energy of 173 kilotons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was 40% the energy release of Chelyabinsk, but it was over the Bering Sea so it didn't have the same type of effect or show up in the news,&quot; said Kelly Fast, near-Earth objects observations programme manager at Nasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's another thing we have in our defence, there's plenty of water on the planet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Fast was discussing the event here at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, near Houston, Texas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-47030233&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;What could end the world as we know it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military satellites picked up the blast last year; Nasa was notified of the event by the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Johnson said the fireball came in over an area not too far from routes used by commercial planes flying between North America and Asia. So researchers have been checking with airlines to see if there were any reported sightings of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What's the significance?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Congress tasked Nasa with finding 90% of near-Earth asteroids of 140m (460ft) in size or larger by 2020. Space rocks of this size are so-called &quot;problems without passports&quot; because they are expected to affect whole regions if they collide with Earth. But scientists estimate it will take them another 30 years to fulfil this congressional directive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an incoming object is identified, Nasa has had some notable success at calculating where on Earth the impact will occur, based on a precise determination of its orbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2018, the small 3m (10ft) asteroid 2018 LA was discovered by a ground-based observatory in Arizona eight hours before impact. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) then made a precision determination of its orbit, which was used to calculate a probable impact location. This showed the rock was likely to hit southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the calculation suggested, a fireball was recorded over Botswana by security camera footage on a farm. Fragments of the object were later found in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

<title>How Boeing, FAA certified the suspect 737 MAX flight control system</title>
<link>https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/failed-certification-faa-missed-safety-issues-in-the-737-max-system-implicated-in-the-lion-air-crash/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/failed-certification-faa-missed-safety-issues-in-the-737-max-system-implicated-in-the-lion-air-crash/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As Boeing hustled in 2015 to catch up to Airbus and certify its new 737 MAX, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) managers pushed the agency’s safety engineers to delegate safety assessments to Boeing itself, and to speedily approve the resulting analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the original safety analysis that Boeing delivered to the FAA for a new flight control system on the MAX — a report used to certify the plane as safe to fly — had several crucial flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That flight control system, called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), is now under scrutiny after two crashes of the jet in less than five months resulted in Wednesday’s FAA order to ground the plane.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Current and former engineers directly involved with the evaluations or familiar with the document shared details of Boeing’s “System Safety Analysis” of MCAS, which The Seattle Times confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-section=&quot;business&quot; class=&quot;most-read-container module article-aside story-list most-shared truncate show mrw-section&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;most-read-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most Read Business Stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understated the power of the new flight control system, which was designed to swivel the horizontal tail to push the nose of the plane down to avert a stall. When the planes later entered service, MCAS was capable of moving the tail more than four times farther than was stated in the initial safety analysis document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failed to account for how the system could reset itself each time a pilot responded, thereby missing the potential impact of the system repeatedly pushing the airplane’s nose downward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assessed a failure of the system as one level below “catastrophic.” But even that “hazardous” danger level should have precluded activation of the system based on input from a single sensor — and yet that’s how it was designed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who spoke to The Seattle Times and shared details of the safety analysis all spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their jobs at the FAA and other aviation organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Boeing and the FAA were informed of the specifics of this story and were asked for responses 11 days ago, before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/a-sense-of-urgency-as-investigation-into-second-recent-crash-of-a-boeing-737-max-begins/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;second crash of a 737 MAX last Sunday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late Friday, the FAA said it followed its standard certification process on the MAX. Citing a busy week, a spokesman said the agency was “unable to delve into any detailed inquiries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing responded Saturday with a statement that “the FAA considered the final configuration and operating parameters of MCAS during MAX certification, and concluded that it met all certification and regulatory requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding that it is “unable to comment … because of the ongoing investigation” into the crashes, Boeing did not respond directly to the detailed description of the flaws in MCAS certification, beyond saying that “there are some significant mischaracterizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several technical experts inside the FAA said October’s Lion Air crash, where the MCAS has been clearly implicated by investigators in Indonesia, is only the latest indicator that the agency’s delegation of airplane certification has gone too far, and that it’s inappropriate for Boeing employees to have so much authority over safety analyses of Boeing jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to make sure the FAA is much more engaged in failure assessments and the assumptions that go into them,” said one FAA safety engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Certifying a new flight control system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going against a long Boeing tradition of giving the pilot complete control of the aircraft, the MAX’s new MCAS automatic flight control system was designed to act in the background, without pilot input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was needed because the MAX’s much larger engines had to be placed farther forward on the wing, changing the airframe’s aerodynamic lift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Designed to activate automatically only in the extreme flight situation of a high-speed stall, this extra kick downward of the nose would make the plane feel the same to a pilot as the older-model 737s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-single-wrapper image-11383214-1572481577 layout-standard&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-ratio=&quot;1.49925&quot; data-caption=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MCAS-MAX-737-sensor-W-780x520.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MCAS-MAX-737-sensor-W-300x200.jpg 300w, https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MCAS-MAX-737-sensor-W-768x512.jpg 768w, https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MCAS-MAX-737-sensor-W-780x520.jpg 780w, https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MCAS-MAX-737-sensor-W-375x250.jpg 375w, https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MCAS-MAX-737-sensor-W.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 30px), (max-width: 1044px) calc(100vw - 60px), 970px&quot; data-sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 30px), (max-width: 1044px) calc(100vw - 60px), 970px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing engineers authorized to work on behalf of the FAA developed the System Safety Analysis for MCAS, a document which in turn was shared with foreign air-safety regulators in Europe, Canada and elsewhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document, “developed to ensure the safe operation of the 737 MAX,” concluded that the system complied with all applicable FAA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet black box data retrieved after the Lion Air crash indicates that a single faulty sensor — a vane on the outside of the fuselage that measures the plane’s “angle of attack,” the angle between the airflow and the wing — triggered MCAS multiple times during the deadly flight, initiating a tug of war as the system repeatedly pushed the nose of the plane down and the pilots wrestled with the controls to pull it back up, before the final crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, when announcing the grounding of the 737 MAX, the FAA cited similarities in the flight trajectory of the Lion Air flight and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/investigators-find-new-clues-to-potential-cause-of-737-max-crashes-as-faa-details-boeings-fix/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;Investigators also found the Ethiopian plane’s jackscrew&lt;/a&gt;, a part that moves the horizontal tail of the aircraft, and it indicated that the jet’s horizontal tail was in an unusual position — with MCAS as one possible reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators are working to determine if MCAS could be the cause of both crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

(Mike Siegel / The Seattle Times)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delegated to Boeing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAA, citing lack of funding and resources, has over the years delegated increasing authority to Boeing to take on more of the work of certifying the safety of its own airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in certification of the 737 MAX, the FAA safety engineering team divided up the technical assessments that would be delegated to Boeing versus those they considered more critical and would be retained within the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But several FAA technical experts said in interviews that as certification proceeded, managers prodded them to speed the process. Development of the MAX was lagging nine months behind the rival Airbus A320neo. Time was of the essence for Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former FAA safety engineer who was directly involved in certifying the MAX said that halfway through the certification process, “we were asked by management to re-evaluate what would be delegated. Management thought we had retained too much at the FAA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was constant pressure to re-evaluate our initial decisions,” the former engineer said. “And even after we had reassessed it … there was continued discussion by management about delegating even more items down to the Boeing Company.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the work that was retained, such as reviewing technical documents provided by Boeing, was sometimes curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There wasn’t a complete and proper review of the documents,” the former engineer added. “Review was rushed to reach certain certification dates.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When time was too short for FAA technical staff to complete a review, sometimes managers either signed off on the documents themselves or delegated their review back to Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FAA managers, not the agency technical experts, have final authority on delegation,” the engineer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inaccurate limit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this atmosphere, the System Safety Analysis on MCAS, just one piece of the mountain of documents needed for certification, was delegated to Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Boeing document provided to the FAA included a description specifying a limit to how much the system could move the horizontal tail — a limit of 0.6 degrees, out of a physical maximum of just less than 5 degrees of nose-down movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That limit was later increased after flight tests showed that a more powerful movement of the tail was required to avert a high-speed stall, when the plane is in danger of losing lift and spiraling down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of a plane in a high angle-of-attack stall is difficult to model in advance purely by analysis and so, as test pilots work through stall-recovery routines during flight tests on a new airplane, it’s not uncommon to tweak the control software to refine the jet’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Lion Air Flight 610 crash, Boeing for the first time provided to airlines details about MCAS. Boeing’s bulletin to the airlines stated that the limit of MCAS’s command was 2.5 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That number was new to FAA engineers who had seen 0.6 degrees in the safety assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FAA believed the airplane was designed to the 0.6 limit, and that’s what the foreign regulatory authorities thought, too,” said an FAA engineer. “It makes a difference in your assessment of the hazard involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher limit meant that each time MCAS was triggered, it caused a much greater movement of the tail than was specified in that original safety analysis document.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former FAA safety engineer who worked on the MAX certification, and a former Boeing flight controls engineer who worked on the MAX as an authorized representative of the FAA, both said that such safety analyses are required to be updated to reflect the most accurate aircraft information following flight tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The numbers should match whatever design was tested and fielded,” said the former FAA engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both said that sometimes agreements were made to update documents only at some later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible the latest numbers wouldn’t be in there, as long as it was reviewed and they concluded the differences wouldn’t change the conclusions or the severity of the hazard assessment,” said the former Boeing flight controls engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the final safety analysis document was updated in parts, it certainly still contained the 0.6 limit in some places and the update was not widely communicated within the FAA technical evaluation team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“None of the engineers were aware of a higher limit,” said a second current FAA engineer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy over this number is magnified by another element in the System Safety Analysis: The limit of the system’s authority to move the tail applies each time MCAS is triggered. And it can be triggered multiple times, as it was on the Lion Air flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One current FAA safety engineer said that every time the pilots on the Lion Air flight reset the switches on their control columns to pull the nose back up, MCAS would have kicked in again and “allowed new increments of 2.5 degrees.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So once they pushed a couple of times, they were at full stop,” meaning at the full extent of the tail swivel, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Lemme, a former Boeing flight controls engineer who is now an avionics and satellite-communications consultant, said that because MCAS reset each time it was used, “it effectively has unlimited authority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiveling the horizontal tail, which is technically called the stabilizer, to the end stop gives the airplane’s nose the maximum possible push downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It had full authority to move the stabilizer the full amount,” Lemme said. “There was no need for that. Nobody should have agreed to giving it unlimited authority.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Lion Air flight, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/black-box-data-reveals-lion-air-pilots-struggle-against-boeings-737-max-flight-control-system/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;when the MCAS pushed the jet’s nose down, the captain pulled it back up&lt;/a&gt;, using thumb switches on the control column. Still operating under the false angle-of-attack reading, MCAS kicked in each time to swivel the horizontal tail and push the nose down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The black box data released in the preliminary investigation report shows that after this cycle repeated 21 times, the plane’s captain ceded control to the first officer. As MCAS pushed the nose down two or three times more, the first officer responded with only two short flicks of the thumb switches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a limit of 2.5 degrees, two cycles of MCAS without correction would have been enough to reach the maximum nose-down effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final seconds, the black box data shows the captain resumed control and pulled back up with high force. But it was too late. The plane dived into the sea at more than 500 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;System failed on a single sensor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line of Boeing’s System Safety Analysis with regard to MCAS was that, in normal flight, an activation of MCAS to the maximum assumed authority of 0.6 degrees was classified as only a “major failure,” meaning that it could cause physical distress to people on the plane, but not death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of an extreme maneuver, specifically when the plane is in a banked descending spiral, an activation of MCAS was classified as a “hazardous failure,” meaning that it could cause serious or fatal injuries to a small number of passengers. That’s still one level below a “catastrophic failure,” which represents the loss of the plane with multiple fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former Boeing flight controls engineer who worked on the MAX’s certification on behalf of the FAA said that whether a system on a jet can rely on one sensor input, or must have two, is driven by the failure classification in the system safety analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said virtually all equipment on any commercial airplane, including the various sensors, is reliable enough to meet the “major failure” requirement, which is that the probability of a failure must be less than one in 100,000. Such systems are therefore typically allowed to rely on a single input sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the consequences are assessed to be more severe, with a “hazardous failure” requirement demanding a more stringent probability of one in 10 million, then a system typically must have at least two separate input channels in case one goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing’s System Safety Analysis assessment that the MCAS failure would be “hazardous” troubles former flight controls engineer Lemme because the system is triggered by the reading from a single angle-of-attack sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A hazardous failure mode depending on a single sensor, I don’t think passes muster,” said Lemme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all 737s, the MAX actually has two of the sensors, one on each side of the fuselage near the cockpit. But the MCAS was designed to take a reading from only one of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lemme said Boeing could have designed the system to compare the readings from the two vanes, which would have indicated if one of them was way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the system could have been designed to check that the angle-of-attack reading was accurate while the plane was taxiing on the ground before takeoff, when the angle of attack should read zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They could have designed a two-channel system. Or they could have tested the value of angle of attack on the ground,” said Lemme. “I don’t know why they didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The black box data provided in the preliminary investigation report shows that readings from the two sensors differed by some 20 degrees not only throughout the flight but also while the airplane taxied on the ground before takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No training, no information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Lion Air crash, 737 MAX pilots around the world were notified about the existence of MCAS and what to do if the system is triggered inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing insists that the pilots on the Lion Air flight should have recognized that the horizontal stabilizer was moving uncommanded, and should have responded with a standard pilot checklist procedure to handle what’s called “stabilizer runaway.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If they’d done so, the pilots would have hit cutoff switches and deactivated the automatic stabilizer movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing has pointed out that the pilots flying the same plane on the day before the crash experienced similar behavior to Flight 610 and did exactly that: They threw the stabilizer cutoff switches, regained control and continued with the rest of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/faa-evaluates-a-potential-design-flaw-on-boeings-737-max-after-lion-air-crash/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;pilots and aviation experts say that what happened on the Lion Air flight doesn’t look like a standard stabilizer runaway&lt;/a&gt;, because that is defined as continuous uncommanded movement of the tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the accident flight, the tail movement wasn’t continuous; the pilots were able to counter the nose-down movement multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the MCAS altered the control column response to the stabilizer movement. Pulling back on the column normally interrupts any stabilizer nose-down movement, but with MCAS operating that control column function was disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These differences certainly could have confused the Lion Air pilots as to what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since MCAS was supposed to activate only in extreme circumstances far outside the normal flight envelope, Boeing decided that 737 pilots needed no extra training on the system — and indeed that they didn’t even need to know about it. It was not mentioned in their flight manuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stance allowed the new jet to earn a common “type rating” with existing 737 models, allowing airlines to minimize training of pilots moving to the MAX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association at American Airlines, said his training on moving from the old 737 NG model cockpit to the new 737 MAX consisted of little more than a one-hour session on an iPad, with no simulator training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimizing MAX pilot transition training was an important cost saving for Boeing’s airline customers, a key selling point for the jet, which has racked up more than 5,000 orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s website pitched the jet to airlines with a promise that “as you build your 737 MAX fleet, millions of dollars will be saved because of its commonality with the Next-Generation 737.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the crash, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/u-s-pilots-flying-737-max-werent-told-about-new-automatic-systems-change-linked-to-lion-air-crash/&quot; class=&quot;content-link&quot;&gt;officials at the unions for both American and Southwest Airlines pilots criticized Boeing&lt;/a&gt; for providing no information about MCAS, or its possible malfunction, in the 737 MAX pilot manuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An FAA safety engineer said the lack of prior information could have been crucial in the Lion Air crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing’s safety analysis of the system assumed that “the pilots would recognize what was happening as a runaway and cut off the switches,” said the engineer. “The assumptions in here are incorrect. The human factors were not properly evaluated.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Dimas Ardian / Bloomberg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, before the grounding of the 737 MAX, Boeing outlined “a flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX,” that it’s been developing since soon after the Lion Air crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a detailed FAA briefing to legislators, Boeing will change the MCAS software to give the system input from both angle-of-attack sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also limit how much MCAS can move the horizontal tail in response to an erroneous signal. And when activated, the system will kick in only for one cycle, rather than multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing also plans to update pilot training requirements and flight crew manuals to include MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These proposed changes mirror the critique made by the safety engineers in this story. They had spoken to The Seattle Times before the Ethiopian crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FAA said it will mandate Boeing’s software fix in an airworthiness directive no later than April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing legal actions brought by the families of those killed, Boeing will have to explain why those fixes were not part of the original system design. And the FAA will have to defend its certification of the system as safe.&lt;/p&gt;
