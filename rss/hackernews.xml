<title>Bezos Investigation Says the Saudis Obtained His Private Data</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For 40 years, I’ve advised at-risk public figures and government agencies on high-stakes security matters. My career has included working with the CIA, FBI, at the Reagan White House, counseling foreign leaders, and advising on controversial murder cases. I’ve seen a lot. And yet, I’ve recently seen things that have surprised even me, such as the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; parent company, AMI, being in league with a foreign nation that’s been actively trying to harm American citizens and companies, including the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. You know him as Jeff Bezos; I know him as my client of 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand where this story goes, some background is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; published a special edition that revealed an intimate relationship Bezos was having. He asked me to learn who provided his private texts to the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, and why. My office quickly identified the person whom the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; had paid as a source: a man named &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7&quot;&gt;Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, the now-estranged brother of Lauren Sanchez, whom Bezos was dating. What was unusual, very unusual, was how hard AMI people worked to publicly reveal their source’s identity. First through strong hints they gave to me, and later through direct statements, AMI practically pinned a “kick me” sign on Michael Sanchez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was not the White House, it was not Saudi Arabia,” a company lawyer said on national television, before telling us more: “It was a person that was known to both Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.” In case even more was needed, he added, “Any investigator that was going to investigate this knew who the source was,” a very helpful hint since the name of who was being investigated had been made public 10 days earlier in a &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe&quot;&gt;Daily Beast report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much was made about a recent front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, fingering Michael Sanchez as the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; source—but that information was first published almost seven weeks ago by The Daily Beast, after “multiple sources inside AMI” told The Daily Beast the exact same thing. The actual news in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; article was that its reporters were able to confirm a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/brother-of-jeff-bezos-girlfriend-admits-a-deal-with-national-enquirer&quot;&gt;claim Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; had been making: It was &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-national-enquirer-got-bezos-texts-it-paid-200-000-to-his-lovers-brother-11552953981&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; who first contacted Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; about the affair, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMI has repeatedly &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/business/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-amazon-hollywood.html&quot;&gt;insisted they had only one source&lt;/a&gt; on their Bezos story, but the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; began conversations with Michael Sanchez, they had “already been investigating whether Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez were having an affair.” Michael Sanchez has since confirmed to Page Six that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; contacted him back in July, they had already “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagesix.com/2019/03/30/this-was-real-lauren-sanchezs-brother-tells-all-on-bezos-romance/?_ga=2.164107583.1694089182.1553909345-326982824.1534253864&quot;&gt;seen text exchanges&lt;/a&gt;” between the couple. If accurate, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and Page Six stories would mean, clearly and obviously, that &lt;em&gt;the initial information came from other channels—another source or method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bezos directed me to ‘spend whatever is needed’ to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it. That investigation is now complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is complicated, and can’t always be boiled down to a simple narrative like “the brother did it,” even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid, and even when that brother is an associate of Roger Stone and Carter Page. Though interesting, it turns out those truths are also too simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did AMI’s people work so hard to identify a source, and insist to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and others that he was their sole source for everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best answer is contained in what happened next: AMI threatened to publish embarrassing photos of Jeff Bezos unless certain conditions were met. (These were photos that, for some reason, they had held back and not published in their first story on the Bezos affair, or any subsequent story.) While a brief summary of those terms has been made public before, others that I’m sharing are new—and they reveal a great deal about what was motivating AMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eight-page contract AMI sent for me and Bezos to sign would have required that I make a public statement, composed by them and then widely disseminated, saying that my investigation had concluded they hadn’t relied upon “any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their news-gathering process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note here that I’d never publicly said anything about electronic eavesdropping or hacking—and they wanted to be sure I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also wanted me to say our investigation had concluded that their Bezos story was not “instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise.” External forces? Such a strange phrase. AMI knew these statements did not reflect my conclusions, because I told AMI’s Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard (in a 90-minute recorded phone call) that what they were asking me to say about external forces and hacking “is not my truth,” and would be “just echoing what you are looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Indeed, an earlier set of their proposed terms included AMI making a statement “affirming that it undertook no electronic eavesdropping in connection with its reporting and has no knowledge of such conduct”—but now they wanted me to say that for them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract further held that if Bezos or I were ever in our lives to “state, suggest or allude to” anything contrary to what AMI wanted said about electronic eavesdropping and hacking, then they could publish the embarrassing photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this today because it’s exactly what the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; scheme was intended to prevent me from doing. Their contract also contained terms that would have inhibited both me and Bezos from initiating a report to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things didn’t work out as they hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the terms for avoiding publication of personal photos were presented to Jeff Bezos, he responded immediately: “No thank you.” Within hours, he wrote an essay describing his reasons for rejecting AMI’s threatening proposal. Then he &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f&quot;&gt;posted it all on Medium&lt;/a&gt;, including AMI’s actual emails and their salacious descriptions of private photos. (After the Medium post, AMI put out a limp statement saying it “believed fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues Bezos raised in his Medium post have nothing whatsoever to do with Michael Sanchez, any more than revealing the name of a low-level Watergate burglar sheds light on the architects of the Watergate cover-up. Bezos was not expressing concerns about the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; original story; he was focused on what he called “extortion and blackmail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Bezos directed me to “spend whatever is needed” to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investigation is now complete. As has been reported elsewhere, my results have been turned over to federal officials. Since it is now out of my hands, I intend today’s writing to be my last public statement on the matter. Further, to respect officials pursuing this case, I won’t disclose details from our investigation. I am, however, comfortable confirming one key fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information. As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not reach our conclusions lightly. The inquiry included a broad array of resources: investigative interviews with current and former AMI executives and sources, extensive discussions with top Middle East experts in the intelligence community, leading cybersecurity experts who have tracked Saudi spyware, discussions with current and former advisers to President Trump, Saudi whistleblowers, people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), people who work with his close associate Saud al-Qahtani, Saudi dissidents, and other targets of Saudi action, including writer/activist &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.arabtyrantmanual.com/&quot;&gt;Iyad el-Baghdadi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts with whom we consulted confirmed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports on the Saudi capability to “collect vast amounts of previously inaccessible data from smartphones in the air without leaving a trace—including phone calls, texts, emails”—and confirmed that hacking was a key part of the Saudis’ “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html&quot;&gt;extensive surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately led to the killing of [&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;] journalist Jamal Khashoggi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans will be surprised to learn that the Saudi government has been intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudi campaign against Bezos has already been reported by &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business&quot;&gt;CNN International&lt;/a&gt;, Bloomberg, &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-saudis-made-jeff-bezos-public-enemy-1&quot;&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia attacks people in many ways, obviously, including through their &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;elaborate social media program&lt;/a&gt; that uses sophisticated technology and paid surrogates to create artificially trending hashtags. To give you an idea of how this program has infected the U.S., the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that the Saudis &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;even had an operative inside Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which fired the suspect employee, and later advised select activists and others that “your Twitter account is one of a small group of accounts that may have been targeted by state-sponsored actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the Saudi government &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business/video/playlists/business-jeff-bezos/&quot;&gt;unleashed its cyberarmy&lt;/a&gt; on Bezos (and later me). Their multi-pronged campaign included public calls for boycotts against Amazon.com and its Saudi subsidiary, Souq.com. Just three examples among thousands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BlockQuote&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;BlockQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;10.861016949153&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Mobiledoc&quot; readability=&quot;17.196610169492&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We as Saudis will never accept to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aadelljaber/status/1059178591567728640&quot;&gt;attacked by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, only to buy products from Amazon and Souq.com by night! Strange that all three companies are owned by the same Jew who attacks us by day, and sells us products by night!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our weapon is to boycott… because the owner of the newspaper is the same as their owner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yhya_jaber/status/1065352725750259712&quot;&gt;We're after you - the Jew&lt;/a&gt;, worshipper of money, will go bankrupt by the will of God at the hands of Saudi Arabia... the owner of Amazon and Souq is the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is the spiteful Jew who insults us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezos is not Jewish, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied the well-documented and close relationship between MBS and AMI chairman, David Pecker. That alliance includes David Pecker &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/media/david-pecker-trump-saudi-arabia.html&quot;&gt;bringing MBS intermediary&lt;/a&gt; Kacy Grine to a private White House meeting with President Trump and Jared Kushner. Pecker has also traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with the Crown Prince. Though we don’t know what was discussed in those private meetings, AMI’s actions afterwards are telling. To coincide with MBS’ March 2018 U.S. tour, AMI created a 100-page, ad-free, glossy magazine called &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-publisher-pal-puts-saudi-propaganda-magazine-in-us-supermarkets&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since MBS wasn’t yet a notorious figure in the West (this was before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi), AMI’s magazine introduced him to Americans as “the most influential Arab leader—transforming the world at 32,” and “improving lives of his people &amp;amp; hopes for peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press reported that AMI sent &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;an advance digital copy&lt;/a&gt; of their laudatory magazine to the Saudi Embassy three weeks before printing and distributing 200,000 issues. (Despite AP’s substantial forensic evidence, the kingdom denied it received the magazine’s content in advance. While we’re on denials, the kingdom says Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with the Bezos matter. The kingdom also says MBS had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When AMI publicly insisted that nobody outside of their executives and editors “had any influence on this publication or its content,” I guess they meant other than Kacy Grine, the very same MBS intermediary Pecker had brought to The White House. I say that because AMI soon had to disclose to the Department of Justice National Security Division that their mystery magazine included content written by Grine, and that they also gave him the whole working draft for advance review, and that he suggested changes, and that they implemented his changes, and that he provided better photographs of MBS. With friends like AMI, you don’t need… publicists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My firm has done many investigations into &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; misconduct, including one that became the subject of a &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-29/entertainment/ca-1145_1_national-enquirer&quot;&gt;investigative piece&lt;/a&gt; way back in 1990. Before then, tabloids had been seen as almost funny publications, mixing celebrity gossip with space aliens and Elvis sightings. But when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; on-again-off-again relationship with the truth percolated into politics, it wasn’t so funny anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though relatively benign at first (“Al Gore’s Diet Is Making Him Stupid”), the Trump/Pecker relationship has metastasized: In effect, the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/media/national-enquirer-trump-mistresses.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; became an enforcement arm&lt;/a&gt; of the Trump presidential campaign, and presidency, as the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York laid out in its case against Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty. The U.S. Attorney has done the country a service by levying extensive controls on AMI, David Pecker, and his deputy Dylan Howard, through a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1119501/download&quot;&gt;non-prosecution agreement&lt;/a&gt; that requires them to commit no other crimes for three years, and requires everyone at AMI to attend annual training on federal election laws. I’m guessing that’s not how they used to spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;Fancylinks&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be wrong to imply that the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t evolved since the ’90s, because it has. The tabloid and its chairman have evolved into &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;secretly entangling with a nation-state&lt;/a&gt; that’s using its enormous resources to harm American citizens and companies. And now they’ve evolved into trying to strong-arm an American citizen whom that country’s leadership wanted harmed, compromised, and silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Saudi side of the equation: Not only does the kingdom have a close alliance with AMI—which owns the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Star&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt;, Radar Online, and many other publications—but the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/saudi-arabia-hollywood-media-deals-where-they-stand-jamal-khashoggi/&quot;&gt;Saudis have pursued investments&lt;/a&gt; and partnerships involving &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the Robb Report&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike these publications, it’s clear that MBS considers the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; to be a major enemy. Saudi Arabia is hardly the first repressive regime that seeks total control of the news media in its own country. Wanting to control the media in the United States—and using any means to do so—will hopefully prove to be an overreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Annoying calls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens Advice commissioned a survey about unwanted PPI calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in four of those who had received unwanted calls said this had interrupted family meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls remain the most common form of contact about PPI claims, followed by automated landline messages and text messages to mobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who believes that they have been mis-sold PPI can make a claim directly to their provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;He admitted the scheme had changed his attitude, saying: &quot;I want cold calls&quot;, and that he had moved on to encouraging companies to make contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a recent problem with his online shopping, he declined to call an 0845 number but posted his number on Twitter in the knowledge that the number could be picked up by marketing companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the premium number regulator Phone Pay Plus says the public should think twice before setting up their own lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say phone line providers must meet consumer protection standards, which include transparency, fairness and complaint handling, which would mean clearly setting out the cost of each call to any organisation that rang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They told You and Yours: &quot;Premium rate numbers are not designed to be used in this way and we would strongly discourage any listeners from adopting this idea, as they will be liable under our code for any breaches and subsequent fines that result.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey for charity Citizens Advice found that two-thirds of those asked had received unwanted calls, texts, emails or letters about PPI mis-selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half said that they had been contacted more than 10 times in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;author-timestamp&quot; itemprop=&quot;datePublished&quot; content=&quot;2019-03-30T11:00-500&quot;&gt;March 30 at 11:00 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;A common ailment is going around, and you probably know someone plagued by it. Caused in part by social media, the 24-hour news cycle and the pressure to check work email outside of office hours, it could hit you, too — especially if you don’t know how to nip it in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Burnout is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Books are being published about it, high-powered medical groups are raising alarms and ordinary people are feeling it. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/01/PhysicianBurnoutReport2018FINAL.pdf&quot; title=&quot;cdn1.sph.harvard.edu&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard and Massachusetts medical organizations declared physician burnout a public health crisis. It pointed out the problem not only harms doctors but also patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;“Burnout is associated with increasing medical errors,” the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Ninety-five percent of human resource leaders say burnout is sabotaging workplace retention, often because of overly heavy workloads, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/employee-burnout-crisis-study-reveals-big-workplace-challenge-2017&quot; title=&quot;www.kronos.com&quot;&gt;survey found&lt;/a&gt;. Poor management contributes to the burnout epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;“Organizations typically reward employees who are putting in longer hours and replace workers who aren’t taking on an increased workload, which is a systematic problem that causes burnout in the first place,” says Dan Schawbel, research director of Future Workplace, the firm that conducted the survey along with Kronos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot; class=&quot;fixjump&quot;&gt;&quot;Mommy Burnout,&quot; a book published last year by psychologist Sheryl Ziegler, resonated with women who had run themselves into the ground trying to be super mom (and dads made it clear they were burned out, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;A new book, “Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle,” by sisters Emily Nagoski (a health educator) and Amelia Nagoski (a choral conductor who was hospitalized for burnout) aims to help women, in particular, live a more balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Burnout is a term easily tossed around, the way somebody might claim to be starving when they’re simply hungry, or freezing when cold. That’s harmless if a person is describing a tired day or week. But somebody who is actually burned out should be prepared to take serious action because it’s a condition that needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/how-you-can-battle-burnout/2019/03/29/a83bed70-4f47-11e9-8d28-f5149e5a2fda_story.html&quot;&gt;How you can battle burnout&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Amelia Nagoski was juggling the demands of a doctoral program when she experienced such severe abdominal pain she was hospitalized. Doctors concluded it was “just stress” and told her to relax. Turns out, she had stress-induced inflammation from burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Ziegler defines burnout as “chronic stress gone awry.” The big three symptoms are emotional exhaustion, cynicism and feeling ineffective, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nam.edu/valid-reliable-survey-instruments-measure-burnout-well-work-related-dimensions/&quot; title=&quot;nam.edu&quot;&gt;Maslach Burnout Inventory&lt;/a&gt; (MBI), a survey designed to measure employee burnout in the workforce. Other symptoms can include frequent colds or sicknesses, insomnia and a tendency to alleviate stress in unhealthy ways, such as with too much alcohol or online shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Part of the difficulty of pinpointing true burnout may be because burnout is a nonmedical term — at least in the United States. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders doesn’t list it as an illness. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889935/&quot; title=&quot;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;&gt;other countries&lt;/a&gt; including France, Denmark and Sweden, do recognize burnout syndrome and consider it to be a legitimate reason to take a sick day from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;“Everybody intuitively recognizes what burnout feels like in their bodies and their feelings and their thoughts,” Emily Nagoski says. “It’s like art: You know it when you see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Even without an official diagnosis — or agreed upon definition — American researchers have studied burnout for decades. Psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/05/nyregion/herbert-freudenberger-73-coiner-of-burnout-is-dead.html&quot; title=&quot;www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Herbert Freudenberger&lt;/a&gt; popularized the term in the 1970s, basing it on his work with drug addicts where he witnessed their veins burn out from needle injections and their cigarettes burn down. Soon after, psychologist Christina Maslach developed the MBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Burnout is caused by chronic stress, not stressors, the Nagoskis say in their book. It’s important to differentiate the two. Stressors are external: to-do lists, financial problems or anxiety about the future. Stress, on the other hand, “is the neurological and physiological shift that happens in your body when you encounter [stressors],” the Nagoskis write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;To fix burnout, people need to address the stress itself. They must allow their body to complete its stress response cycle. Instead, people tend to focus on stressors. “They assume their stress will go away if they’re on top of things, if they’re accomplishing things and constantly checking things off their to-do list,” Emily Nagoski says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;That’s a lesson Paula Davis-Laack learned the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Davis-Laack practiced commercial real estate law before the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The fast-paced environment gave her a constant adrenaline high as she closed deals and kept so busy that she barely left time to grab a handful of peanuts for lunch. Her frequent headaches, stomach aches and colds threatened to drag her down, but no doctor could give her a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;One day, drafting a document in her office, she says she felt like she couldn’t breathe. She bolted out of her chair and raced to a nearby health clinic. “Help me!” she gasped. She was having a panic attack. After two more medical crises landed her in the emergency room, she feared a mental or physical collapse if she kept going. She decided to walk away from the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;“It was like a 50,000-pound weight lifted off my shoulders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Still unsure of what was wrong, she poked around the Internet doing research of her own when she came across information on burnout. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is exactly what happened to me!’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Davis-Laack traces the beginning of her burnout back to her teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;“There were a lot of messages to be a high achiever,” she says. “Those check-the-box matrix measurements were important to me. I internalized them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;The messages took an even stronger hold once she started working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;She returned to graduate school to study well-being, the effects of stress and their effect on the workplace. In 2013, she opened the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pauladavislaack.com/&quot; title=&quot;www.pauladavislaack.com&quot;&gt;Davis Laack Stress &amp;amp; Resilience Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Wisconsin. She now teaches workshops on burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;For those who suspect they might be on the road to burnout, there are practical tools to mitigate it. Among others: physical exercise, sleep and positive social connection (the real kind, not the Facebook kind). The importance of balance and self-care to prevent burnout likely isn’t surprising to most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;“There’s nothing fancy about what it would take to turn things around,” says Ziegler, the “Mommy Burnout” author. “But it’s a huge shift in the cultural mind-set. That’s the challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Plus, fixing burnout can feel like adding more stressors. An employee who takes a lunch break in a park (time in nature reduces stress) might feel pressured to stay late at the end of the day. A yoga class or walk is another item to squeeze into the calendar. A mom can’t quit her parenting job. To address time-management issues, the Nagoskis provide work sheets in their book to help readers reprioritize activities. Ziegler suggests setting boundaries with social media. Use the Internet for help, such as ordering groceries, but limit scrolling to 10 minutes a day. Also, it’s okay to remove activities from the calendar (or quit them completely) so you can exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Gender might play a role in burnout, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;Researchers from the University of Montreal questioned 2,026 people, half women, in 63 different workplaces. Their work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/annweh/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/annweh/wxx114/4870017?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot; title=&quot;academic.oup.com&quot;&gt;published in the Annals of Work Exposure and Health&lt;/a&gt;, found that women reported higher levels of burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;One reason was because women have more work-and-family conflicts. The women’s rights movement was “supposed to give women choices,” Ziegler says. “Sounds awesome, but it became you need to do it all. You need to run your house and be the perfect wife and mom and work. The stress on women got higher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;Other studies have shown that rates of burnout are more or less equal among genders, although males and females experience it differently. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-240&quot; title=&quot;bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;published in BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt; showed that female physicians are susceptible to burnout from emotional exhaustion while male physicians to burnout because of cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Steven Manning remembers the night he realized he had become pessimistic about practicing medicine. One Wednesday at his family care practice in Williamston, N.C., he worked on electronic medical records well past 9 p.m. His wife and kids waited for him at home. He had seen about 30 patients that day but felt he hadn’t given a single one the highest level of care because the appointment times were too short. Yet the hospital and insurance companies kept pressuring him to see more patients a day, not fewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;“I began to think, ‘I’m burned out. How did I get to this point? I don’t enjoy coming into work.’ ” It wasn’t too late to make a change. Within a year, Manning started a direct primary care practice, a model where patients pay a membership fee, negating the need for insurance billing. Without mounds of paperwork, he had time to do what he truly wanted: help patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;“It brought back the joy of medicine I felt I was missing,” he says. “Before, I barely had time to address my patients’ diabetes, hypertension and heart failure, let alone spend time taking a mental and spiritual inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;Now, he talks with patients about depression, anxiety and stress and notices many patients are burned out, especially mothers of young kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;Lawyer and mom Anna Swain knows the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;She poured her heart and soul into fixing the troubled lives of criminals who had messed up with drugs and violence only to wind up devastated when her hard work seemed pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;40&quot;&gt;“I’d call my mom every day on my way home from the office crying,” she says. “I was either sad over a client who was having her third meth-addicted baby or crying over a shockingly rude email by opposing counsel.” When she added motherhood to the mix, her feelings of failure increased. “I didn’t know what I was doing. Nobody does with a first child.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Burned out on “doing the next thing I was supposed to do to be a good girl and get ahead,” she knew she needed downtime, but she was afraid to take a step back from the hamster wheel. “Boredom goes against everything we’re told to do to succeed, achieve and be proactive,” Swain says. “Even when I clean the house, I think, ‘Well, I should take the opportunity to listen to a podcast. Maybe I can grow as a person.’ Honestly, I’d grow more if I chose to be in silence and let my mind wander.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;42&quot;&gt;She tried it. Rocking her baby to sleep, she wanted to watch the TV series “Game of Thrones” or scroll through her phone. But she couldn’t. One wrong move — or the glow of a screen — would wake her baby up. At first, Swain felt angry and resentful at the lack of distractions, but the stillness gave her an opportunity to daydream. That opened the door to creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;43&quot;&gt;“I started creating little poems and rhymes in my head. I felt exhilarated,” she says. Eventually, Swain wrote a children’s book. “I felt a sense of purpose again,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;44&quot;&gt;The Nagoskis agree that daydreaming during low-demand tasks, having a creative outlet and engaging with something larger are three more keys to preventing burnout. They suggest writing your own obituary to find out what is meaningful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;45&quot;&gt;“It sounds dark,” Amelia Nagoski says. “But it makes you think about who you are and what’s important to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;46&quot;&gt;Making space in our lives so we’re not so hurried and harried isn’t easy, especially in a culture that shames slow living, Amelia Nagoski says. Preventing burnout requires hard decisions. Everyone has the same amount of time in a day: 24 hours. To rest — whether with a walk, an extra hour of sleep or a talk with a friend — means something else drops off the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;47&quot;&gt;At first, you might panic that you’re not “accomplishing” something. But before long, you may notice you’ve moved farther away from a breaking point. Your downward spiral will change directions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Boss is 90% of the &amp;#039;Employee Experience&amp;#039;</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-boss-90-employee-experience-nothing-else-comes-jim-bohn-ph-d-/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past several decades we've seen various frills added to the corporate [employee] experience: workout centers, coffee break locations on campus, better cafeterias, maybe some improved parking, and a host of on-line access to services like insurance, working-from-home, personalized learning and, in some cases, improved 401(k)s. Good stuff and a response to employees demanding more as generations and demographics change. Understood. Some of it was long overdue. Today, some might call this 'the employee experience'. And for 10% of the time we're at our jobs, it truly is the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's that other 90% that keeps nagging me. The part that simply will not change unless corporations do some dramatic work to focus on the major element in employee experience. &lt;em&gt;Your boss&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;your employee experience.&lt;/em&gt; I am not alone in this assertion. Researchers in organizational development find this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Recently wrote an article on this subject. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-experience-organizational-holy-grail-jim-bohn-ph-d-/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The employee experience]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The person you work for &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; 90% of the employee experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of four decades I worked for upwards of 30 different managers and leaders in different companies (I was a contract tech for a while so I got to see many different organizations). Some of them were outstanding, intelligent, just, insightful, creative, and easy to talk with. They had a way to improve the day, every day. They had flashes of brilliance that were utterly inspiring. They knew how to talk (and listen) to anyone, at any level in the organization. &lt;em&gt;They were my employee experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the very rough edges of a very rough childhood did not prepare me for some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand that none of my bosses were in a specific age or gender category - the demographics were all over the map. Yet each one of them was a data point in 'the employee experience'. I kept a blood pressure card while I worked for one of them. It was extremely high most days and my family gave me 20 minutes of decompression before they'd speak to me. Others were incredible mentors who were flat out brilliant. I learned from them - they listened to me - and we got a boatload of stuff done together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the primary reason you find yourself dreading going to work is your boss, you'll agree that no amount of 'employee experience' perks is going to take away that dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;u&gt;crazy&lt;/u&gt; ones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;borderline psychotic&lt;/strong&gt;, still fighting military battles long past. Loud shouting, threats of termination, snap reactions, red faces and angry voices raised were all part of that &lt;em&gt;employee experience&lt;/em&gt;. Jekyll and Hyde doesn't do some of them justice. The classic 'amygdala hijack' that we hear of in EQ was not uncommon with those leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;simply weird&lt;/strong&gt; meaning they were unpredictable, finding humor in strange things, mocking customers, criticizing quirks in other employees and exhibiting odd behavior. Of all I worked for, these made me the most uncomfortable. I never knew what they might be thinking. They were flat out creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;narcissistic&lt;/strong&gt; to the level they didn't believe anyone else mattered at all --- for anything --- and they were sometimes abusive to the extreme. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-survive-organizational-dragons-james-g-bohn-ph-d-/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How to survive organizational dragons.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;drama addicts&lt;/strong&gt; who sought out the latest gossip or '&lt;em&gt;fall of the mighty&lt;/em&gt;' to drool over and wanted to discuss the drama ad infinitum, ultimately revealing their personal sense of being treated unjustly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-sized egos comes to mind when I think of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[See &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2rf90H3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Nuts and Bolts of Leadership&quot;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The weak ones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few who simply 'marked time'. Generally it was because they had achieved a level in an organization I doubt they ever imagined they could accomplish. Some of them simply stuck around a long time and got promoted into roles that paid well, and they didn't want to do anything to 'screw it up'. Thus they gave everyone in a department the same percentage increase and rarely spoke up about any problems their people were facing. 'Best to keep your head down', would have been their motto. Some of them had poor communication skills and leaned heavily on secretaries and admin people to keep them out of trouble. They were the ones I endured but knew I could survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The thoughtful and insightful ones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insightful and interesting role model bosses were &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. They were people who inspired me to come to work. Every day I was learning something new about a business or a tool from their experience. They saw strategy and complex issues with clarity. I was often humbled in their presence and felt the need to work harder to keep up with their example. Quite often these leaders were pleasant, had a sense of humor and yet knew how to get the job done. They knew how to listen, and they knew what to ask. Several of them are some of the smartest people I've ever met. I would love to list them in this post, but they're not the sort who would want that kind of notoriety. But they were good bosses, and I look back with pride on what we accomplished together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was an employee experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your boss holds your life in his or her hands. Your boss is your employee experience.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinating activities&lt;/em&gt; - The work that happens with others and other teams is coordinated by your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building team reputation&lt;/em&gt; - The 'good bragging' your boss does has an impact on how your team is perceived in the organization. That's a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting you choice projects&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss has heavy influence on the work you get, and the work you get builds your career and your long-term resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recognition&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss hands out recognition (or doesn't). That recognition has an influence on who you influence in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rewards&lt;/em&gt; - Your raises, your perks, your promotions and your privileges are in the hands and heart of your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coaching and performance review&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss has the honor and privilege of helping you grow and also analyzing your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adjustments to policies&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss has the ability to modify and adjust policy for travel, educational tuition assistance and other corporate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hard truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No amount of atmosphere is going to make up for a manager who is angry, incompetent, weak, unable to keep their word, or shrugging their shoulders and constantly saying &quot;people have to do what upper management says&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself dreading to go to work, think carefully about 'why?'. Is it the lack of a cafeteria? Perhaps the parking isn't great. Maybe there are some things about the job you simply don't like --- understood --- &lt;em&gt;but that's true in any job&lt;/em&gt;. Few of us sing like a Disney character all day while we're working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the primary reason you find yourself dreading going to work is your boss, you'll agree that no amount of 'employee experience' perks is going to take away that dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll note that I still remember these different leaders though I've not worked with many of them for decades. Experience endures in memory, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postscript&lt;/strong&gt; - I'm convinced that that majority of issues people have with corporations and organizations today stem from bad experiences with horrible bosses. Thus, organizations would be best served by applying their utmost energy to improving the skill-sets and emotional intelligence of the people who lead at any level. Find the exemplar leaders and have them teach others to improve 'the employee experience' for your entire organization. And get rid of the crazies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As always, I welcome your thoughtful insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coc is an intellisense engine for vim8 &amp;amp; neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works on &lt;code&gt;vim &amp;gt;= 8.1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;neovim &amp;gt;= 0.3.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a completion framework and language server client which supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions&quot;&gt;extension features of VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/251450/55285193-400a9000-53b9-11e9-8cff-ffe4983c5947.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/251450/55285193-400a9000-53b9-11e9-8cff-ffe4983c5947.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True snippet and additional text edit support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floating window requires master of neovim to work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/F.A.Q#how-to-make-preview-window-shown-aside-with-pum&quot;&gt;follow the steps in the faq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/blob/master/doc/coc.txt&quot;&gt;doc/coc.txt&lt;/a&gt; for vim interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Completion experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why yet another completion engine since there is the already widely used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe&quot;&gt;YouCompleteMe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim&quot;&gt;deoplete.nvim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the reasons that led coc.nvim to build it's own engine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full LSP completion support&lt;/strong&gt;, especially snippet and &lt;code&gt;additionalTextEdit&lt;/code&gt; feature, you'll understand why it's awesome when you experience it with coc extension like &lt;code&gt;coc-tsserver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous and parallel completion request&lt;/strong&gt;, unless using vim sources, your vim will never blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does completion resolve on completion item change&lt;/strong&gt;. The detail from complete item is echoed after selected, this feature requires the &lt;code&gt;CompleteChanged&lt;/code&gt; autocmd to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomplete request and cancel request support&lt;/strong&gt;, only incomplete complete request would be triggered on filter complete items and cancellation request is send to servers when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start completion without timer&lt;/strong&gt;. The completion will start after you type the first letter of a word by default and is filtered with new input after the completion has finished. Other completion engines use a timer to trigger completion so you always have to wait after the typed character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realtime buffer keywords&lt;/strong&gt;. Coc will generate buffer keywords on buffer change in background (with debounce), while some completion engines use a cache which could be wrong sometimes. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#_locality-bonus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Locality bonus feature&lt;/a&gt; from VSCode is enabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter completion items when possible.&lt;/strong&gt; When you do a fuzzy filter with completion items, some completion engines would trigger a new completion, but coc.nvim will filter the items when possible which makes it much faster. Filtering completion items on backspace is also supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Table of contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Completion sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion from words of buffers and file paths are supported by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other completion sources, check out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Create-custom-source&quot;&gt;create custom source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions are powerful than configured language server. Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions&quot;&gt;Using coc extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more, to get a full list of coc extensions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Acoc.nvim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;search coc.nvim on npm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; use &lt;code&gt;:CocConfig&lt;/code&gt; to edit the configuration file, auto completion is supported after &lt;code&gt;coc-json&lt;/code&gt; has been installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example vim configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-viml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; if hidden is not set, TextEdit might fail.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Better display for messages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cmdheight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Smaller updatetime for CursorHold &amp;amp; CursorHoldI&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a good reason people call Twitter the hell website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynicism, egos, unprovoked hostility, unchecked propaganda, sexism, bigotry, and outright hate—Twitter is as full of it as virtually anywhere online, and worse, it’s unbearably nonstop. The design of the place feels uniquely unhealthy due in large part to its speed and unrelenting stream. Opening up TweetDeck, the Twitter-owned client favored by maniacs like me thanks to its real-time updating feature, can seem like stepping into an oncoming tidal wave and getting swept out to sea. Before too long, you feel exhausted and ready to give up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have to be on Twitter due to our jobs, some of us just feel like we have to be. I’m here to offer a few ancient and unsexy alternatives to Twitter as life preservers. We’re doing a nautical theme today, by the way, I hope that’s cool with you. No reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, social media is water in our lungs (I’m sorry, I’m sorry, that’s the last one). With so many of us contemplating deleting our accounts or at least cutting down on that screen time, it’s time to reconsider something that feels lost in this era of algorithm-fueled newsfeeds and timelines: RSS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is a family of technologies that give you a simple feed from a spot on the web—a news site, a podcast, a blog—into your RSS reader. It’s a timeline of sorts, yes, but it runs at a sane speed, and it stays in your control, unlike Facebook or Twitter’s unknowable whims, and it excludes the vast majority of toxic noise that characterizes so much of social media. Folks, RSS is still good. More than just good, RSS is better in many ways than Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invented exactly 20 years ago this month on the back-end of a feverish dot-com boom, RSS (Real Simple Syndication) has persisted as a technology despite Google’s infamous abandonment with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/google-reader-is-shutting-down-here-are-the-best-alter-5990456?tag=google-reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://lifehacker.com/google-reader-is-shutting-down-here-are-the-best-alter-5990456?tag=google-reader', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;death of Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; and Silicon Valley social media companies trying and succeeding to supplant it. In the six years since Google shut down Reader, there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;a million words&lt;/a&gt; written about the technology’s rise and apparent fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s important: RSS is very much still here. Better yet, RSS can be a healthy alternative when Twitter is making you feel like shit. In 2019, that’s, like, most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, Twitter’s main value proposition is that it delivers up-to-the-second news. Let’s just be honest with ourselves: 99 percent of the time, we don’t need up-to-the-second news. Most of us would do much better waiting until someone has had time to process the news and write more than 280 characters to explain in full what’s going on. Ideally, that happens on news websites themselves, which more often than not still offer RSS feeds. Gizmodo, for instance, is putting RSS out into the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/rss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/rss', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;at this very moment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS has the advantage of &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; slow without being slow. You can get an article in your RSS reader as soon as it’s been published—and how much faster are you really looking to go? What you don’t get is the flash flood of half-thoughts and hot takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, I’m not going to pretend I have this abyssal hellscape figured out. I’m not performatively quitting Twitter, this is not a blog about a black-and-white solution requiring you to quit social media and live in a monastery, even though that sounds pretty great. It’s about an alternative to a tool that, after a while, can be a hindrance rather than a help—at least to my sanity. The idea of seeking out the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/find-comfort-on-the-slow-web/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.wired.com/story/find-comfort-on-the-slow-web/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;slow web&lt;/a&gt;” has been around for a long time. But there’s nothing wrong with wanting to get the latest news as it happens. It’s just a matter of striking the right balance, which RSS provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an easy process to start. First, choose an RSS reader. My two favorites are &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://feedly.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsblur.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.newsblur.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/a&gt;. I prefer NewsBlur because I like the iOS app more, but Feedly is very popular and good, so give either one a try. They both accomplish the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, find your feeds. I’d start with, at most, 10 news sites to subscribe to. This will give you a feel for how fast you want the feed to move. Too slow? Add more. To fast? Delete a few. I try to narrow things down even further: Instead of subscribing to the New York Times, which publishes dozens of items per day, I subscribe specifically to the Times’ tech section, which means I get a much more curated selection. For whichever site you want to subscribe to, you should be able to copy and paste the URL into your reader and subscribe from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If RSS alone doesn’t quite do it for you, there are other tools that make finding online content less soul-sucking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complement to my RSS reader is my &lt;a href=&quot;http://nuzzel.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http://nuzzel.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Nuzzel&lt;/a&gt; account. Like RSS, Nuzzel is years old, and it’s relatively slow. I cannot stress enough: Slow can be good. Nuzzel looks at your Twitter account and surfaces the stories being shared most within the last few hours or days—an easy way to parse through the headlines your follows think are most important without necessarily getting caught in the hair-trigger tweets that can make it a relentless cesspool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same realm of slow tech, there’s a “new” trend that’s actually older than RSS itself: The email newsletter. Everyone and their dad seem to have one these days, and there’s even a New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/new-social-network-email-newsletter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/new-social-network-email-newsletter.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;trend piece&lt;/a&gt; on the whole phenomenon, which is how you know it’s already old and uncool as hell. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An email newsletter avoids most of the pitfalls of Twitter hell while still delivering on many of value points. If you’re on Twitter to dive into a specific world—tech, basketball, national security, make up, whatever—there’s almost certainly a good newsletter for it, whether it’s from a specific publication or a smart individual who wants to write and riff but who probably hates Twitter as much as the rest of us. Get the intelligence and links delivered to your inbox daily and then move on. No getting wiped out by the endless social media riptide. Oh, by the way, we’re back to nautical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For newsletters, you can do two things. First, your news websites and blogs of choice probably have newsletters that you can sign up for from the home page—which you probably already know thanks to the charming pop-ups that everyone uses because fuck you that’s why. Second, there are two startups behind many of today’s active newsletters: &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://substack.com/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getrevue.co/explore&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.getrevue.co/explore', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;Revue&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at both sites and see what interests you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we’re probably not going to be able to escape social media entirely. I couldn’t even if I wanted to since it’s part of my job, as it may be part of yours. For us poor souls—and those of you who are, for some reason, online all day by choice—know that it’s okay to slow down. You’re not missing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Leveraging A Poor Memory In Engineering</title>
<link>https://senrigan.io/blog/chasing-10x-leveraging-a-poor-memory-in-software-engineering</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://senrigan.io/blog/chasing-10x-leveraging-a-poor-memory-in-software-engineering</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was burned out and my software career was stalling just three years in. My memory sucked. Was my poor memory from stress, lack of sleep or was it always this bad? Work was a cycle of &quot;TODAY IS THE DAY I CHANGE&quot; and end in a self-loathing dopamine-addicted HackerNews, Reddit and Medium. I was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice I Needed But Ignored #213&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't tie your self-worth to your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be a good, hell, great software engineer. But my work was mediocre. Even worse, I was trying. My ass was in that chair twelve hours a day, six days a week trying to write beautiful Python code. I was constantly looking up documentation and sucked into the internet's rabbit-hole of distractions. I was a try-hard failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there was Kyle. Kyle and I had started programming from scratch; we were both learning on the job. Three years later, our progress was nothing alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kyle is the first 10X engineer I have ever worked with.&quot; - Every. single. coworker. w/ 15+ years experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle worked weekdays from 10AM to 4PM. He got his work done early and single-handedly output 80% of the entire team. Adding more insult to injury, he only worked like 60% of the time. The rest of the time was spent on ... HackerNews, Reddit and Medium. I was the try-hard slow brute, and Kyle was the graceful hare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle didn't have a secret routine. He never meditated. He was skinny despite McDonalds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But, Kyle had a super hero ability. Photographic memory in API syntax and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted that and I was jealous. My career was stuck and something needed to change. And so I began a dedicated journey into spaced repetition. Every day for three years, I spent one to three hours in spaced repetition. It was brutal and I needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is Spaced Repetition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is a remembering technique that will remind you concepts at &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;spaced&lt;/span&gt; intervals to maximize memory retention efficiently. It's a strategy to remind our brains of facts; it exploits that the best time to be remember a fact is &lt;span data-token-index=&quot;3&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; before we forget it. Our brains are forgetful, but we can use strategies to make it less forgetful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/PQi7hTmXRcue4txkNTRp&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At increasing spacing intervals, memory is more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory (and less likely forgotten). Notice the duration of each reminder is further out every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/2HhUrUsSiqQl0WDPrwcL&quot; alt=&quot;forgetting_curve_2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This image represents exactly the same as above, but in different colors to promote retention. I'm full of brain hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend you had six chances in a year to remind Bill Gates your name. If Bill remembers your name a full calendar year later, you get a million dollars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which reminder interval would you pick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1 - Cram Before the Exam:&lt;/strong&gt; Dec 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2 - The Ivy League Valedictorian:&lt;/strong&gt; 1st of every other month. Jan 1st, March 1st, April 1st, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3 - Spaced Repetition:&lt;/strong&gt; January 1st, January 3rd, January 20th, Feb 28th, April 15th, September 30th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option 3 (Spaced Repetition) gives you the highest probability of Bill remembering your name. Ah, the Captain Obvious Blog Writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Why Option 3?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cramming rarely works after it passes from short-term memory. How many cram sessions do you remember from high school?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evenly spaced reminders sort-of works, but you'd have to review all your knowledge at every interval, which doesn't sound scalable/fun/have a social life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our brains work best with exponentially spaced reminders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of medical students and language learning apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, spaced repetition isn't common. It's not as cool as cramming, but it works. Medical students use it to memorize those awful thousand page textbooks. Duolingo uses it because it's effective. Remember that guy dominating Jeopardy a few years ago? Spaced repetition fanatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it's so amazing, why isn't spaced repetition common?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People don't know about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you use it, it's hard to make a habit of reviewing flashcards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making flashcards is annoying. Who wants to type notes into a flashcard app?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People take a big talk about self-improvement, but don't want to do no stinkin' hard work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not cool. You're not going to bringing up flashcard studying on your first date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But software engineers already have these pain points ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engineers are expected to know about upcoming trends. Otherwise, you'd still be using BitBucket and Adobe Flash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers are creatures of habit. Make reviewing your flashcard app your first work task (or the train, the toilet right before Candy Crush). Stop StackOverflowing &quot;how do i amend my git commit&quot; five times every month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of using Quiver, EverNote, Notion, etc, for notetaking, save it as a flashcard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a good software engineer requires lifelong learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's be honest, you're not getting first dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supermemo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SuperMemo&lt;/a&gt; are the most common spaced repetition applications. Both help create flashcards and quiz based off an spacing algorithm. If you get a question right, it'll ask again further out. Get a card wrong? It'll remind you tomorrow. I use Anki. Anki seems more common among software engineers. Download the mobile app (iOS/Android). &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Android app is fantastic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick terminology (in case you forgot ...):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spaced repetition is a learning technique.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anki and SuperMemo are applications that will use spaced repetition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create flashcards in Anki and SuperMemo. They quiz you at spaced intervals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deck is commonly referred to as your entire flashcard collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Habit:&lt;/span&gt; Whenever I search StackOverflow, I'll immediately create a flashcard of my question and the answer(s) into Anki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/GJKR95RHQI6VsDjQ15Oe&quot; alt=&quot;anki_card_1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height=&quot;298&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Parameter about gsutil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/7wW4UFxS0KRctWNA8T12&quot; alt=&quot;anki_card_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height=&quot;215&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy question I got wrong yesterday. I was almost too embarrassed to show this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaced repetition is an offline poor man's StackOverflow (Yes, I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://kapeli.com/dash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-token-index=&quot;1&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt;). Pre-Anki, I was forgetting syntax equivalent to my daily learnings. I was already using Anki for general knowledge. Why not embrace programming flashcards for Anki? I was hesitant because of a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laziness. Writing good Anki programming flashcards can be hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flashcards w/code is difficult to remember. It's much easier to remember the capital of Mongolia (Ulaanbaatar) than how to copy a list of files in a .txt file from an externally mounted hard drive using xargs (cat list.txt | xargs -l{} mv /Volumes/External/{} /Desktop). Getting a card wrong for multiple days is frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the last three years, I've added EVERYTHING to Anki. Bash aliases, IDE Shortcuts, programming APIs, documentation, design patterns, etc. Having done that, I wouldn't recommend adding EVERYTHING. That topic of my Anki mistakes deserves it's own article ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After embracing Anki, once I had mastered a card, the quick recall around language and framework APIs was like having my prayer to the flow gods finally being answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, my all-too common pattern was :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;StackOverflow some syntax I frustratingly forgot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get distracted. Read HackerNews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hmm, nothing new on HackerNews, let's try Reddit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to get into flow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despair. Maybe someone posted a new story on HackerNews?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now equipped with an improved memory in API syntax, documentation, country capitals, and engineering — there's a stark difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2016 - Short Bursts Followed By Frustrating Distractions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.snag.gy/Z1lXxi.jpg&quot; width=&quot;755&quot; height=&quot;213&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Current Year to Date - I Should Find A New Hobby ...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/YJAAIqRFmP6oU79lGWQ8&quot; alt=&quot;github_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;791&quot; height=&quot;223&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Commitment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spaced repetition requires a daily commitment, but guarantees a great memory. Most users average about twenty minutes a day reviewing. If you're adding zero additional cards (cough, slacker), your review time averages to zero as knowledge become long-term memory. The confidence of knowing that once something is added to Anki it won't be forgotten is &lt;strong&gt;intoxicating&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-token-index=&quot;0&quot; data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.buttercms.com/8rt0jW5TSzucfjEsOeyM&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot; width=&quot;871&quot; height=&quot;739&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaced repetition is my most important career/life-hack&lt;/strong&gt;. It's not always easy. It doesn't guarantee you'll be a better engineer (best practices and design beats syntax), but it'll make you a capable one. When you can quickly recall syntax, you'll be amazed at how fast you can code. Sometimes that just results in shitty code, faster. &lt;strong&gt;But the best coders code a lot&lt;/strong&gt;. And that's the only guaranteed way to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge compounds in interesting ways. Many of my flashcards include blogs and articles about engineering — knowing the history of RPC, SOAP, REST and GraphQL has lead to improved design and architecture decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Counter&lt;/strong&gt;: Memorizing binary search tree algorithms has yet to come in handy ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chasing 10X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began this by chasing an absurd dream of &quot;becoming a 10X engineer&quot;. Like there would be a graduation ceremony or something ridiculous. On second thought, the &quot;Biggest Tool of the Year&quot; award sounds about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what constitutes a 10X engineer; we don't have benchmarks that encompass output, leadership, code quality and technical debt. Chasing 10X became meaningless when I finally had the confidence that I was shaping my own self-improvement. An improved memory gave me control of my own destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyle is still multiples better than I will ever be, and that's perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice I Needed But Ignored #421&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't compare yourself to others. Just make sure you're improving everyday. Compound interest is the most powerful thing in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>The Programming Language Conundrum</title>
<link>http://evrl.com/programming/2019/03/28/the-language-conundrum.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://evrl.com/programming/2019/03/28/the-language-conundrum.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has been written about “hyperproductive teams”, and a lot has been written how programming languages help here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot;&gt;Beating the Averages&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most famous one. I myself worked in Smalltalk full-time, and can share the same kind of story. So why aren’t we all using either of these two languages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I created my own startup, an Internet hosting company, I went down the same path as Paul Graham: two coders, me and a full time one, a VisualWorks Smalltalk license, and we managed to develop something that was utterly impressive given that we had 1.5FTE on the job. Hosting provisioning, accounting, all sorts of really advanced stuff around whole-sale packaging, multiple currencies, and so on. Later on, I worked at a larger Smalltalk shop and between 5-6 developers we completely beat large companies employing ten times as many people. So why aren’t we all using either of these two languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can recite many of such stories; of people keeping up with their ten person team by coding whatever the team did during the day in 2-3 hours at night using Squeak Smalltalk; about an old Lisp hacker working in a research setup with mostly Java colleagues and always estimating to need 10% of the time (and then actually making the estimate). So why aren’t we all using either of these two languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is multifaceted, of course. There’s a fear, often more with management than actual techies, of choosing a non mainstream language because hiring for that language will be too hard (wrong). Tooling for niche languages often is not as good as for mainstream stuff (quick, find a way to deploy a Pharo Smalltalk image on EC2 or in a container). The list goes on and on and usually every point can receive the same reaction: yes, that might be true, but if the payoff is that big, why not make the investment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s one thing in common between all the stories I’ve heard and the successes experienced first hand: small teams. Every single time, you are looking at a software development shop with a grand total of, say, less than a dozen developers in a pretty stable setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, I think, is the only way to use these very powerful languages (and do not forget: they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; that powerful). Because, each in its own way, these languages encourage you to solve your problem in two steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a language to solve your problem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve your problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisp is more explicit about this, but I opened an old Smalltalk image and the “application” language ended up being very high level, very domain specific, and just as hard to grok as your average macro-ridden Lisp system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These languages are very powerful, but they don’t scale. So even when you get ten times the productivity, the mostly tribal complexity will not scale beyond your “pizza-sized team” and therefore you now have a hard upper limit on your total software development capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harsh, isn’t it? But I cannot find counterexamples. Whereas I can find plenty of examples of teams using “normal” programming languages (Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, or newer entrants like Elixir or even Golang) that breeze through the 100, 200, 500 developer marks without much trouble. So I must conclude that there seems to be a scaling limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? My theory, completely made up and untested, is that these powerful Lisp/Smalltalk systems weave code and brains together in a way that amplifies both. It’s very organic, very hard to document, and thus it becomes very hard to absorb new brains into the system. When I joined the small Smalltalk group it was very hard to get started in that codebase. It was complex, and completely different from the previous thing I worked on. Both were using the same VM (VisualWorks) but both had their IDEs adapted to a point that they became new and very well-honed tools and new things in their own right. In Smalltalk, there’s no difference between writing “business” code and writing “tooling” code, and even no difference between that and changing your IDE, so everything happens interchangeably and fluidly and you end up with an IDE that’s adapted for the problem at hand, not for everybody’s generic problems. It’s hard to ramp-up in these environments and certainly in the light of the short retention times these days, likely won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on that terrible disappointment… I think I’ll end while hoping that someone out there on planet Earth reads this and proves me wrong :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop=&quot;description&quot; readability=&quot;112&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-caps=&quot;initial&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;IPPOCRATES, GALEN&lt;/small&gt;, Avicenna and other ancient physicians frequently used odour as a diagnostic tool. Although scent is not used nearly as often in modern medicine, it still has its place. Paramedics are routinely taught to spot the fruity smell on the breath of diabetics who have become hyperglycaemic and gastroenterologists are trained to detect the odour of digested blood. But there has been scant evidence of a smell associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Now one has been found for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently causing tremors, rigidity and dementia, Parkinson’s is both debilitating and substantially shortens life expectancy. The rate at which these symptoms appear and worsen cannot be stopped or slowed yet but its most harmful effects can be staved off with drugs. As with many diseases, the earlier the intervention, the better. Yet herein lies one of the greatest challenges—there are no tests that diagnose whether Parkinson’s is actually present. The best that neurologists can do is study the symptoms and theorise about whether someone actually has the disease. Hence the search is on for a better form of diagnosis. Unexpectedly, scientists are now literally following someone’s nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joy Milne, a retired nurse from Perth, Scotland has an extraordinary sense of smell. Known as hyperosmia, Mrs Milne’s condition allows her to detect odours that are imperceptible to most people. In 1974 Mrs Milne noticed an odd musky smell around her house that had not been present before. In 1986, her husband, Les Milne, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. He lived with the disease for a number of years and while the symptoms were initially manageable with medication, this became harder over time. Eventually, he was forced to retire and, while attending Parkinson’s support groups, Mrs Milne noted something extraordinary. Everyone with the disease had the same distinctive odour that her husband had developed in 1974. It was shortly after that realisation that she started collaborating with researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Musky odour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing Mrs Milne with shirts worn by Parkinson’s patients, researchers found she was able to identify that the smell was concentrated along the upper back, and not in armpits as previously assumed. Most remarkably, of the control subjects without the disease, Mrs Milne found one to have the musky odour. Nine months later that person was diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this led Perdita Barran of the University of Manchester, in Britain, to set out to discover what was producing the telltale odour that Mrs Milne could detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work found that patients with Parkinson’s had a tendency to overproduce a waxy compound on the skin of their upper backs. Known as sebum, Dr Barran speculated that something trapped within this compound was producing the odour. Keen to find out, Dr Barran and her colleagues set up an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team analysed sebum samples from 43 people suffering from Parkinson’s and 21 who were not. The sebum samples were collected on gauze and warmed to release any volatile compounds that might be found within them. Mass spectrometry and gas chromatography were then used to identify whether there were volatiles present and what they were. For a subset of the patient samples, Mrs Milne smelled the compounds before they entered the mass spectrometer and pressed a button when the distinctive odour was present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr Barran reports in &lt;small&gt;ACS&lt;/small&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;Central Science&lt;/em&gt;, the mass spectrometer identified four compounds, perillic aldehyde, hippuric acid, eicosane and octadecanal, in the vaporised sebum of the Parkinson’s disease patients that were at entirely different levels to those in the healthy group. To test whether these different levels of compounds were generating the smell that Mrs Milne was detecting, Dr Barran presented them to her and confirmed that they were, indeed, responsible for the musky odour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While relatively small in size, Dr Barran’s experiment is the first to reveal the specific compounds that generate the unique smell of Parkinson’s. Assuming larger follow-up experiments replicate her findings, the work paves the way for the development of a device, a sort of electronic nose, that could sniff the upper backs of patients to quickly determine who has the disease and who does not. That would allow drugs to help mitigate the symptoms to be administered all the sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Finally Killed AirPower</title>
<link>https://ifixit.org/blog/14883/what-finally-killed-airpower/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ifixit.org/blog/14883/what-finally-killed-airpower/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a surprising turn of events, Apple has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cancelled its long-awaited AirPower wireless charging mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The company says the product didn’t meet its “high standards,” but wasn’t specific as to why. We’ve been watching this space carefully and have an informed guess as to what happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AirPower was first introduced to the public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/12/apple-airpower-wireless-charging/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;in September of 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;during Apple’s iPhone X reveal. The company promised a single wireless charging mat that could charge three devices at the same time, like your iPhone, Apple Watch, and your AirPods (the last of which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+2+Teardown/121471&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;got wireless charging capabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple planned on releasing AirPower the year after the iPhone X, in 2018. However, it was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/apples-airpower-charging-mat-delayed-until-fall-due-to-technical-hurdles/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reportedly hit with numerous delays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And as 2018 dragged on, the speculation of its cancellation loomed large, especially after Apple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-scrubs-most-references-to-airpower-from-its-website/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;completely wiped its website clean of any mention of the product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a full year after its announcement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting in 2019, though, a glimmer of hope emerged:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chargerlab/status/1083952811887357952&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rumors surfaced that AirPower’s production was ramping up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, pointing to the possibility that this product would finally be close to shipping. So close, in fact, that an iOS 12.2 beta—released just ten days before the AirPower’s cancellation—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2019/03/19/latest-ios-12-2-beta-includes-support-for-airpower-charging-mat-as-release-appears-imminent/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;included official support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the now-defunct wireless charger. And the second-generation AirPods even have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+2+Teardown/121471#s233841&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;an illustration of the wireless charging mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the back of the box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/AqHaCKHPMGQWZ6u4&quot; width=&quot;6212&quot; height=&quot;3036&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AirPower was cancelled a mere nine days later, making us wonder what must have happened. After all, there are plenty of wireless charging mats on the market that can charge multiple devices at the same time. But unlike those mats (which are really just three separate chargers next to each other in the same unit), Apple wanted to take things to the next level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With that said, we have a theory as to why Apple’s wireless charger fell completely flat during its last-second Hail Mary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overheating and Interference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wireless charging pads use electromagnetic induction to juice up your phone. Both the pad and your phone contain wire coils: the pad draws current from the wall and runs it through the coil, creating an electromagnetic field. That field induces an electric current in your phone’s wire coil, which it uses to charge the battery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the electricity being transmitted to your phone isn’t perfectly clean or ideal. It generates some noise, which can interfere with other wireless devices. That’s why the FCC (and regulatory bodies in other countries) set strict limits on wireless emissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Noise from a single coil might not be a problem, but each charging coil generates a slightly different waveform. When those waves overlap, the constructive interference intensifies their strength. Just like when two ocean waves collide and combine their height, radio frequencies can combine their intensity as they interact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Managing these overlapping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;harmonic frequencies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;is incredibly challenging, and gets harder the more coils that you are integrating. From patent filings, it looks like Apple’s ambitious plan was to use considerably more coils than other charging pads on the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/ZeVIYex5sbywgEnk&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;900&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Rumors speculated that Apple was considering up to 32 coils—up from the fifteen shown in their conceptual patent filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other multi-device wireless chargers place two or three coils side-by-side, but require you to fiddle with your phone to find the “sweet spot” over one coil for it to start charging. With AirPower, Apple was trying to create one large charging surface using overlapping coils, allowing it to power multiple devices from anywhere on the mat. But that introduces multiple challenges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We asked an engineer with experience building wireless charging systems what obstacles Apple was working to overcome. “Over time, these harmonics add up and they become really powerful signals in the air,” explains William Lumpkins, VP of Engineering at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ons-services.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;O &amp;amp; S Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “And that can be difficult—that can stop someone’s pacemaker if it’s too high of a level. Or it could short circuit someone’s hearing aid.” If Apple’s multi-coil layout was spinning off harmonics left and right, it’s possible AirPower couldn’t pass muster with US or EU regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of what’s astonishing about the AirPower cancellation is how last-minute it was, right on the heels of the AirPods 2 release. But Lumpkins says that happens sometimes. He speculated that Apple had AirPower working in their labs: ”Well, so what always happens is you get it functional first. No one looks at [Electro-Magnetic Interference] until the end.” The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://fccid.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FCC-Wireless-Charging-Rules.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;FCC rules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for wireless charging devices like AirPower are quite strict, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/1.1310&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;limit exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;at 20 cm (8 in) above the device to 50 mW/cm^2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869072/apple-airpower-overheating-issues&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rumors have circulated for months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about AirPower’s overheating issues, which would click nicely into place with this theory. In order to power multiple devices through a large array of coils, they would need a significant amount of power. “Overheating means they’re putting too much current into it, which means they’re trying to up the power level,” says Lumpkins. “My guess is they’re trying to pump out so much of a field, which is getting it to overheat.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple boxed themselves into an electromagnetic corner. What they wanted to do was physically possible—and they surely had it working in the lab—but they couldn’t consistently meet the rigorous transmission requirements that are designed to keep us safe from our gadgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
