<title>Oh shit, git (2016)</title>
<link>https://ohshitgit.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ohshitgit.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;intro&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;ads&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you &lt;em&gt;already know the name of the thing you need to know about&lt;/em&gt; in order to fix your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them &lt;em&gt;in plain english&lt;/em&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;11.142857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                git reflog
                # you will see a list of every thing you've done in git, across all branches!
                # each one has an index HEAD@{index}
                # find the one before you broke everything
                git reset HEAD@{index}
                # magic time machine
               &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this to get back stuff you accidentally deleted, or just to remove some stuff you tried that broke the repo, or to recover after a bad merge, or just to go back to a time when things actually worked. I use &lt;code&gt;reflog&lt;/code&gt; A LOT. Mega hat tip to the many many many many many people who suggested adding it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                    # make your change
                    git add . # or add individual files
                    git commit --amend
                    # follow prompts to change or keep the commit message
                    # now your last commit contains that change!
                &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This usually happens to me if I commit, then run tests/linters... and FML, I didn't put a space after the equals sign. You could also make the change as a new commit and then do &lt;code&gt;rebase -i&lt;/code&gt; in order to squash them both together, but this is about a million times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;2.6666666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                        git commit --amend
                        # follow prompts to change the commit message
                &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid commit message formatting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;9.2556634304207&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                    # create a new branch from the current state of master
                    git branch some-new-branch-name
                    # remove the commit from the master branch
                    git reset HEAD~ --hard
                    git checkout some-new-branch-name
                    # your commit lives in this branch now :)
                &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this doesn't work if you've already pushed to origin, and if you tried other things first, you might need to &lt;code&gt;git reset HEAD@{number}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;HEAD~&lt;/code&gt;. Infinite sadness. Also, many many many people suggested an awesome way to make this shorter that I didn't know myself. Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;10.9875&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                    # undo the last commit, but leave the changes available
                    git reset HEAD~ --soft
                    git stash
                    # move to the correct branch
                    git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
                    git stash pop
                    git add . # or add individual files
                    git commit -m &quot;your message here&quot;
                    # now your changes are on the correct branch
                &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have suggested using cherry-pick for this situation too, so take your pick on whatever one makes the most sense to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                    git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
                    # grab the last commit to master
                    git cherry-pick master
                    # delete it from master
                    git checkout master
                    git reset HEAD~ --hard
                &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;5.7294520547945&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;git diff --staged&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git won't do a diff of files that have been &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;-ed to your staging area without this flag. File under ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (yes, this is a feature, not a bug, but it's baffling and non-obvious the first time it happens to you!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;4.25&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                    cd ..
                    sudo rm -r fucking-git-repo-dir
                    git clone https://some.github.url/fucking-git-repo-dir.git
                    cd fucking-git-repo-dir
                &lt;/code&gt;

<title>Dallas Has Now Lost 82 Cases Against Robert Groden (2016)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The city of Dallas got poured out of court again yesterday in its decades long extra-legal persecution of Kennedy assassination expert Robert Groden, making the 82nd time the city has lost against Groden in its own municipal courts, not counting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://%20http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/jfk-conspiracy-author-wins-a-big-one-against-city-halls-catch-22-defense-8412479&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major slap-down&lt;/a&gt; suffered by the city in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s something. In 82 at-bats, 82 strike-outs. In professional baseball you’d have to be the owner’s son to rack up a record like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about a sign that says “Grassy Knoll.” To understand this story, you have to know that the words “grassy knoll” are forbidden in Dallas. No one is allowed to say them out loud, let alone put them on a sign.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe me? Give me a minute. You will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unremitting determination of Dallas to throw the bat at Groden time after time, year after year, with the same result each time (“Yurrr OUT!”) is a remarkable testament to sheer institutional stubbornness and/or sheer institutional stupidity, take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groden sells books, magazines and videos on weekends from a folding table on the grassy knoll (Oh, I said it!) in Dealey Plaza downtown, where President John F. Kennedy was murdered on Nov. 22, 1963. The city has engaged in a decades long war to make Groden go away, repeatedly ticketing and even jailing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the city was kicked out of court for the same old reason: A municipal judge couldn’t find a municipal law that Groden had broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. If you have strong feelings about the Kennedy assassination, Dealey Plaza or banners, please put them aside for one moment and consider this question: How much respect can the city of Dallas command for itself when it knowingly engages in a decades long persecution not based on law?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point do we not have to conclude that Dallas does not respect the law? And then are we supposed to respect Dallas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Dealey Plaza is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions/texas-ustx.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sometimes rated&lt;/a&gt; as the second most visited tourist attraction in the state, &lt;br/&gt;Dallas, which is still ashamed of it, doesn’t put up signs to tell visors where stuff is there. So Groden does. When he’s there selling his wares, he erects a banner by his table that says “Grassy Knoll.” Otherwise, a newcomer would have no idea where it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April 22, a Friday, when a city code inspector and a cop showed up at Groden’s table, Groden was there with his assistant Marshal Evans. The code inspector and the cop ticketed Evans for erecting an illegal sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But — surprise, surprise! — the sign wasn’t illegal. Groden’s attorney Bradley Kizzia explained to me that the ordinance under which the code inspector ticketed Evans didn’t cover temporary banners. Hence, when the ticket finally arrived on the bench of a municipal judge this week, the judge kicked it out of court, saying he had no jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Groden story over and over again. They have ticketed him for selling books and magazines without a license, even though the city ordinance says you don’t have to have a license to sell books and magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ticketed him once for selling in a park, even though Dealey Plaza isn’t a park. They ticketed him for not having a permit to do what he was doing, even though they don’t issue permits for what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time — 82 times — the city gets to court and a judge tells them that he or she cannot try Groden for doing something that is not against the law. So they do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-box&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inner-img-box&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images1.dallasobserver.com/imager/u/745xauto/8680811/dealey_plaza_mark_graham_dalals_observer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dealey Plaza is rated by some as the second most visited tourist site in Texas.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;insert cap-cred&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealey Plaza is rated by some as the second most visited tourist site in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Graham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s sort of remarkable, is it not, almost as if they have a small research team somewhere in the city attorney’s office. Twice a year someone tells them, “Scour the books for something Groden isn’t doing wrong so we can charge him with it and get ourselves kicked out of court again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kizzia is a major piece of the puzzle here, having stuck by Groden over many years. It was Kizzia’s cross-examination in the federal civil rights case that elicited damning testimony from a Dallas police officer. He confessed that he and his superiors knew Groden had broken no law when they jailed him six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the arresting officer reported to his superior that Groden had been forced to go without prescribed medications in jail all night, the superior officer praised him for a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle between Dallas City Hall and Groden probably is not well known within our municipal borders, because the city’s only daily newspaper and other major media here have given it scant attention. But beyond our borders, the story grows. Last year Dutch documentarian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2965273/%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kasper Verkaik&lt;/a&gt; debuted his film about Groden and Dallas City Hall, &lt;a href=&quot;http://%20http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/dutch-film-portrays-our-own-robert-groden-as-obsessed-not-crazy-7401836&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plaza Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has since been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2014/11/10-documentaries-you-must-see-at-this-years-idfa-festival/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;well received&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://%20http://www.nposales.com/homepagenews/plaza-man-selected-for-thessaloniki-documentary-festival/%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;international festivals.&lt;/a&gt; (Dallas City Hall is not the hero.) And in the online universe, the saga of Groden and Dallas City Hall has become Kennedy assassination equivalent of a Mexican &lt;em&gt;corrido&lt;/em&gt; ballad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dallas did beat Kizzia in one round. In federal district court here, former federal District Judge Royal Ferguson ruled that Groden could not sue the city because he was unable to identify the top-most city official originally responsible for the campaign of persecution against him. But the appeals court tossed Ferguson’s ruling and sent the case back to Dallas for a fresh trial with the city as a defendant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That fresh trial keeps getting delayed. Just as the city hoped a night in jail without his meds would break Groden’s will and Kizzia’s determination, they must be hoping now at age 69 that Groden will give up or die. I don’t know about dying, but based on my conversation with him yesterday I would say the city should give up on his ever giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groden says while the city stalls the federal civil rights retrial, it is back to its old tricks, trying to wear him down. Because the city promised a federal judge they wouldn’t harass him until the federal case gets resolved, Groden says, the city has now set out to harass his assistant, ticketing the assistant for the grassy knoll banner even though Groden was standing right there at the time and says he told the code guy it was his sign and he put it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The city doesn’t want to openly harass me until we get to court and see how it gets resolved in front of a judge,” he said. “But going after Marshall is their way of getting around the fact that they promised to leave me alone. This is their way of doing something to try to harass us. That’s the way it looked to me anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do take satisfaction from the Verkaik documentary — beautifully done, if you ever get a chance — for one reason above all others. If the city should get its wish and Groden not survive, if he should shuffle off to his everlasting reward before the federal civil rights case is resolved, God forbid, then at least I know that through the film his ghost will haunt Dallas City Hall forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tesla&amp;#039;s Screen Saga Shows Why Automotive Grade Matters</title>

&lt;h2 class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;Elon Musk bragged that the Model S's 17 inch screen isn't automotive grade, but now Tesla and its customers are mired in &quot;replacement hell.&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;has-ad-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every bit of Tesla-related news and analysis tends to get sucked into the polarized debate over whether Tesla is the greatest company ever or an irredeemable fraud, which is a shame considering there are far more interesting and valuable insights to be gleaned from the company's experience. After all, this is the first time that Silicon Valley's move-fast-and-break-stuff approach has been applied to the methodical, measure-twice-cut-once auto industry and with more high-tech firms moving into mobility it's important that the right lessons are learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most dramatic illustrations of both the benefits and downsides of Tesla's approach to automaking comes from its decision to use 17-inch touch screens in its Model S and X. No automaker had ever used a screen even close to as large as the model Tesla used, and it instantly became a symbol of its entire approach to building cars like mobile devices. In the brutally competitive premium car market, the gigantic display became a rare example of a feature that totally differentiates Tesla's product from even its far newer competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rarely is the question asked: why haven't other automakers kept up with Tesla's competition and installed a similarly massive screen in their cars? After all, if Tesla can buy such a screen from a supplier why can't Mercedes or Lexus? In order to answer this question, we must turn first to Ashlee Vance's biography of Elon Musk in which he brags about the process of sourcing the Model S display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we first talked about the touch-screen, the guys came back and said, ‘There’s nothing like that in the automotive supply chain,’” Musk said. “I said, ‘I know. That’s because it’s never been put in a fucking car before.’” Musk figured that computer manufacturers had tons of experience making seventeen-inch laptop screens and expected them to knock out a screen for the Model S with relative ease. “The laptops are pretty robust,” Musk said. “You can drop them and leave them out in the sun, and they still have to work.” After contacting the laptop suppliers, Tesla’s engineers came back and said that the temperature and vibration loads for the computers did not appear to be up to automotive standards. Tesla’s supplier in Asia also kept pointing the carmaker to its automotive division instead of its computing division. As Musk dug into the situation more, he discovered that the laptop screens simply had not been tested before under tougher automotive conditions, which included large temperature fluctuations. When Tesla performed the tests, the electronics ended up working just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen Tesla ended up going with was the Innolux G170J1-LE1, which was designed for industrial rather than automotive applications. As such it was tested to a higher standard than many laptop screens, and its reliability test criteria (found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acipower.com/LCDFactoryPanel/Datasheet/G170J1-LE1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;page 22 of this data sheet&lt;/a&gt; for rev C3 of the part [PDF]) might seem impressive to anyone outside of automotive supply chain professionals. Some of these standards include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High temperature operation test: +80C for 600 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low temperature operation test: -20C for 120 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High temperature storage test: +90C for 500 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low temperature storage test: -40C for 500 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thermal shock storage test: -40C for 75 min &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; +85C for 75 min; 550 cycles, 1.5 hour/cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this is a later revision introduced in 2016, whereas &lt;a href=&quot;https://manualzz.com/doc/30594343/g170j1-le1-17---innolux-tft-display-specification-industr...&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;earlier versions were slightly less stringent&lt;/a&gt;. Turning to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aecouncil.com/Documents/AEC_Q100_Rev_G_Base_Document.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AEC-Q100 standard for automotive grade thermal testing&lt;/a&gt; [PDF], we find that the standards for the parts that go into your car are much higher. Here is a quick rundown of a few of the thermal standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade 4:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL):&lt;/em&gt; +90C for 408 hours. &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Storage Life (HTSL):&lt;/em&gt; +125C for 1,000 hours. &lt;em&gt;Temperature Cycling:&lt;/em&gt; -10C tp +105C for 500 cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade 3:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL):&lt;/em&gt; +105C for 408 hours. &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Storage Life (HTSL):&lt;/em&gt; +125C for 1,000 hours. &lt;em&gt;Temperature Cycling:&lt;/em&gt; -50C tp +105C for 500 cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL):&lt;/em&gt; +125C for 408 hours. &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Storage Life (HTSL):&lt;/em&gt; +125C for 1,000 hours. &lt;em&gt;Temperature Cycling:&lt;/em&gt; -50C tp +150C for 500 cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL):&lt;/em&gt; +150C for 408 hours. &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Storage Life (HTSL):&lt;/em&gt; +150C for 1,000 hours. &lt;em&gt;Temperature Cycling:&lt;/em&gt; -65C tp +150C for 500 cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grade 0:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL):&lt;/em&gt; +175C for 408 hours. &lt;em&gt;High Temperature Storage Life (HTSL):&lt;/em&gt; +175C for 1,000 hours. &lt;em&gt;Temperature Cycling:&lt;/em&gt; -65C tp +175C for 500 cycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the Innolux screen is tested to roughly the lowest &quot;Grade 4&quot; standard, although even there its high temperature storage testing (as well as high temperatures in thermal cycling testing) falls slightly short. Electronic parts qualified for &quot;passenger compartment hotspots&quot; like a central display are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golledge.com/news/the-aec-q200-standard-what-does-it-really-mean/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;typically tested to Grade 2&lt;/a&gt;, which the Innolux would almost certainly fail to pass. Dashboards and &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/252/1/012027/pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;center stacks see some of the highest interior temperatures&lt;/a&gt; in  a car, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46179184_Study_on_the_Thermal_Accumulation_and_Distribution_Inside_a_Parked_Car_Cabin&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;with +80C easily achieved through solar radiation and ambient temperature alone&lt;/a&gt;, and the nearby HVAC unit, the in-car processor for Autopilot and &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tegra-temps-hastening-the-life-of-the-mcu-in-older-model-s.101074/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the display processor itself&lt;/a&gt;adding considerable thermal load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla's decision to use a large display that wasn't tested to higher automotive grade standards had fairly predictable results. First the Model S and X &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/touch-screen-bubbles-leakage&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;screens were&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/bubbles-main-display-poll&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plagued by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/bubbles-on-touchscreen.55868/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bizarre problem&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2865046/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clearly caused by thermal issues&lt;/a&gt;: bubbles would form on the sides of the displays and eventually leak a gooey adhesive material into the car's interior. Tesla appeared to mostly fix this problem with its &quot;cabin overheat protection&quot; feature (which it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Tweetermeyer/status/1095903806389276672&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sold as being to protect dogs and children&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that it held the temperature at +40C which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Prevent-Child-Deaths-in-Hot-Cars.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;about the temperature where a child's organs will start shutting down&lt;/a&gt;) as well as revisions to the Innolux panel. Intriguingly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentor.com/products/mechanical/engineering-edge/volume6/issue1/thermal-design-approach-automotive-display-integration&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a blog post at Mentor Graphics&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Innolux was struggling with thermal management on a screen for an unspecified &quot;high end automobile,&quot; ultimately concluding that &quot;defining the boundary conditions for Innolux’s system is the responsibility of their customer, not Innolux.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was followed by another problem with Model S and X screens, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/the-yellow-screen-fringe-seems-to-be-a-bigger-issue-for-them.126429/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seems to have been even more widespread&lt;/a&gt;: the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/screen-discoloration.96016/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;yellow banding&quot; problem&lt;/a&gt;. This was similar to problems found on a number of touchscreen devices, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-5-screen-edges-yellow.1716792/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iPhones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/414634/Yellow+streak+around+edge+of+screen&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft Surfaces&lt;/a&gt;, and it too &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314125064_Analysis_of_the_bonding_process_and_materials_optimization_for_mitigating_the_Yellow_Border_defect_on_optically_bonded_automotive_display_panels&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seems to be the result of high thermal loads&lt;/a&gt;. Though &quot;only&quot; a cosmetic issue, many owners report having had Tesla replace their screens (in some cases multiple times) to address the problem. Ultimately, around the end of 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-halts-center-screen-replacements.136674/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tesla stopped replacing screens and told owners it was developing its own solution in-house&lt;/a&gt;, saying the new screen units would be available in the Summer of 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as April 19th, 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/new-screens-now-available.149730/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tesla owners began to report that new screens were available&lt;/a&gt; and that replacement appointments could be scheduled. At least two &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VDDl-9wTsnY&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pro-Tesla Youtubers did receive&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/G-HCVqQjUCk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new replacement screen&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3595421/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another owner posted an invoice&lt;/a&gt; that suggested the new unit was simply remanufactured. Then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3647624/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this Friday reports started coming in&lt;/a&gt; stating that Tesla had suddenly changed its mind and that yellowing screens would not be replaced for free (a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://evbite.com/tesla-puts-an-end-to-goodwill-repairs/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rumor suggests that Tesla is discontinuing all &quot;goodwill repairs&quot;&lt;/a&gt;). The first owner to report this has a five-month-old car with the yellowing screen, and has already endured &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/service-center-scratched-my-mcu-bezel-now-they-need-to-tear-the-dash-apart.152293/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a series of hair-raising service issues&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3653108/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at least two&lt;/a&gt; others &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3648287/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;had an appointment to replace his screen canceled unceremoniously&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest word directly from Tesla comes from yet another forum poster, &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3649700/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who relays the following message&lt;/a&gt; from a Tesla service rep:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon, I have some new around your touchscreen, I was provided with some information that changes things a lot for your appointment. Tesla is attempting to provided a free &quot;healing&quot; service that will eliminate the yellow lines without replacement or even remove of the unit. We are awaiting further details, whether this service will be mobile capable or not and when we will receive the equipment if it is considered mobile capable. In the interim I am sorry to say that if you do wish to have the touch screen changed we would have to charge you ,I apologize, this is new company policy that was given to use earlier today, please let me know if i can provide you with an estimate, thank you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/yellow-haze-around-touchscreen-tesla-reply.152534/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;message, reportedly from Tesla service&lt;/a&gt;, reads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good afternoon, I apologize about the inconvenience but the timeline given for repairs is because Tesla approved this repair last week and will be ordering the specialized tools needed to address this concern. If you wish to have it addressed sooner replacing the touchscreen is an option but will not be covered under warranty since we have not been able to address it with our approved method. Total cost for a screen replacement is $1,346.75 including taxes. Please advise on how you would like to proceed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;articleFragment paragraph&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports are still coming in, and though we aren't yet sure how Tesla will ultimately deal with this saga that has been playing out for years we can at least divine an important lesson from it. This story illustrates why the auto industry moves slowly, tests relentlessly and emphasizes automotive grade reliability and performance over the latest tech and the largest screens. Using a smaller, more expensive automotive grade screen might have cost as much or more per unit and might not have impressed as many consumers, but it might have at least saved Tesla from years of free replacements, bogged-down service centers, and frustrated customers. Especially at mass-market scale, it's always worthwhile to take your lumps upfront than to try to skate by with unqualified hardware and fix units one by one as they fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, other automakers have had issues with touchscreens as well. Just last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2018/ford-agrees-to-settle-myford-touch-lawsuit.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ford settled a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over a host of problems with its MyFordTouch systems and &lt;a href=&quot;https://autoweek.com/article/car-news/ford-upgrade-extend-warranty-myford-touchscreen-system&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;had previously extended warranty coverage for its SYNC systems&lt;/a&gt;. Cadillac &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autonews.com/article/20170227/OEM06/302279988/cadillac-revamps-cue-infotainment-in-response-to-customer-complaints&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;had to recently revamp its CUE touchscreen system&lt;/a&gt; after numerous issues including &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cadillacforums.com/forums/cadillac-srx-second-generation-forum-2010/879234-dreaded-spider-crack-cue-screen-has.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the dreaded spiderweb cracks.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; But it's one thing for a few products in a lineup to have problems, especially if they can be pushed onto the supplier, and quite another for the only car in your lineup (until the Model 3 started shipping in real volume last year) to have such persistent issues with one of their main features. Meanwhile, the real question that this all raises is still to be answered: how well did Tesla learn this lesson with its Model 3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;GILLETTE, Wyo. – The nation’s third-largest coal company by production volume filed for bankruptcy Friday as utility companies increasingly turn to gas-fired generation and renewable energy for electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillette-based Cloud Peak Energy filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. The move was widely expected since at least March, when the company received the first of several extensions to make a $1.8 million loan payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest extension expired Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;dfp-ad-wrap dfp-inline-ad-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;div-gpt-ad-1464884580983-4&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud Peak owns and operates three mines in the Powder River Basin: the Antelope and Cordero Rojo mines in Wyoming and the Spring Creek Mine in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mines shipped 50 million tons of coal in 2018. Cloud Peak officials say the mines will remain in operation during the bankruptcy process.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Numpy Clone in Common Lisp</title>
<link>https://github.com/numcl/numcl</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/numcl/numcl</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-header d-flex flex-items-center flex-justify-between px-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Box-title pr-3&quot;&gt;README.org&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content p-5&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Numpy clone in Common Lisp. At the moment the library is written in pure Common Lisp, focusing more on correctness and usefullness, not speed. Track the progress at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numcl/numcl/projects/1&quot;&gt;https://github.com/numcl/numcl/projects/1&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/245792&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b87f0ca71c6af09bf548ff1fd4351517162e71d4/68747470733a2f2f61736369696e656d612e6f72672f612f3234353739322e737667&quot; alt=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/245792.svg&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://asciinema.org/a/245792.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closely follow the numpy API, but still make it lispy.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delegate the documentation effort to Numpy community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace the Common Lisp array interface.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We do not deviate from the traditional symbols/idioms in Common Lisp unless necessary. Therefore we provide symbols that conflicts the Common Lisp symbol. Math functions become aliases to the original CL functions when the inputs are not arrays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numcl/numcl/blob/master/DETAILS.org#packages&quot;&gt;./DETAILS.org#packages&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Features/Contracts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;APIs are provided as functions, not macros.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a design flaw otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This does not mean the API is functional — we use procedural code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still, zero overhead.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The APIs are simply the wrappers over simple functions and designed to be fully inlined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimization will be done on the compiler side, not by macros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operations are type-correct.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They always return arrays of the most specific array-element-type. For example,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(zeros 5) returns a bit vector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(asarray ‘(1 2 3)) returns an (unsigned-byte 2) vector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numcl/numcl/blob/master/DETAILS.org#types&quot;&gt;./DETAILS.org#types&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;

<title>WhatsApp voice calls were used to inject spyware on phones</title>
<link>https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in the messaging app WhatsApp has allowed attackers to inject commercial Israeli spyware on to phones, the company and a spyware technology dealer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp, which is used by 1.5bn people worldwide, discovered in early May that attackers were able to install surveillance software on to both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malicious code, developed by the secretive Israeli company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/7f2f39b2-733e-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, could be transmitted even if users did not answer their phones, and the calls often disappeared from call logs, said the spyware dealer, who was recently briefed on the WhatsApp hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, is too early into its own investigations of the vulnerability to estimate how many phones were targeted using this method, said a person familiar with the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As late as Sunday, as WhatsApp engineers raced to close the loophole, a UK-based human rights lawyer’s phone was targeted using the same method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab said they believed that the spyware attack on Sunday was linked to the same vulnerability that WhatsApp was trying to patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSO’s flagship product is Pegasus, a program that can turn on a phone’s microphone and camera, trawl through emails and messages and collect location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSO advertises its products to Middle Eastern and western intelligence agencies, and says Pegasus is intended for governments to fight terrorism and crime. NSO was recently valued at $1bn in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/e390685a-5a10-11e9-939a-341f5ada9d40&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;leveraged buyout&lt;/a&gt; that involved the UK private equity fund Novalpina Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, human rights campaigners in the Middle East have received text messages over WhatsApp that contained links that would download Pegasus to their phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp said teams of engineers had worked around the clock in San Francisco and London to close the vulnerability. It began rolling out a fix to its servers on Friday last week, WhatsApp said. All users should update to the latest version of WhatsApp, which was issued on Monday, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This attack has all the hallmarks of a private company known to work with governments to deliver spyware that reportedly takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,” the company said. “We have briefed a number of human rights organisations to share the information we can, and to work with them to notify civil society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp disclosed the issue to the US Department of Justice last week, according to a person familiar with the matter. A justice department spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSO said it had carefully vetted customers and investigated any abuse. Asked about the WhatsApp attacks, NSO said it was investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies,” the company said. “NSO would not, or could not, use its technology in its own right to target any person or organisation, including this individual [the UK lawyer].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK lawyer, who declined to be identified, has helped a group of Mexican journalists and government critics and a Saudi dissident living in Canada sue NSO in Israel, alleging that the company shares liability for any abuse of its software by clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said the attack had failed. “We had a strong suspicion that the person’s phone was being targeted, so we observed the suspected attack, and confirmed that it did not result in infection,” said Mr Scott-Railton. “We believe that the measures that WhatsApp put in place in the last several days prevented the attacks from being successful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other lawyers working on the cases have been approached by people pretending to be potential clients or donors, who then try and obtain information about the ongoing lawsuits, the Associated Press reported in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s upsetting but not surprising that my team has been targeted with the very technology that we are raising concerns about in our lawsuits,” said Alaa Mahajne, a Jerusalem-based lawyer who is handling lawsuits from the Mexican and Saudi citizens. “This desperate reaction to hamper our work and silence us itself shows how urgent the lawsuits are, as we can see that the abuses are continuing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, NSO will also face a legal challenge to its ability to export its software, which is regulated by the Israeli ministry of defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amnesty International, which identified an attempt to hack into the phone of one its researchers, is backing a group of Israeli citizens and civil rights group in a filing in Tel Aviv asking the defence ministry to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/05/israel-amnesty-legal-action-stop-nso-group-web-of-surveillance/&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cancel NSO’s export licence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NSO Group sells its products to governments who are known for outrageous human rights abuses, giving them the tools to track activists and critics. The attack on Amnesty International was the final straw,” said Danna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Israeli Ministry of Defence has ignored mounting evidence linking NSO Group to attacks on human rights defenders. As long as products like Pegasus are marketed without proper control and oversight, the rights and safety of Amnesty International’s staff and that of other activists, journalists and dissidents around the world is at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California jury says Bayer must pay $2B to couple in Roundup cancer trial</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuit/california-jury-says-bayer-must-pay-2-billion-to-couple-in-roundup-cancer-trial-idUSKCN1SJ29F</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bayer-glyphosate-lawsuit/california-jury-says-bayer-must-pay-2-billion-to-couple-in-roundup-cancer-trial-idUSKCN1SJ29F</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A California jury on Monday awarded more than $2 billion to a couple who claimed Bayer AG’s glyphosate-based Roundup weed killer caused their cancer, in the largest U.S. jury verdict to date against the company in litigation over the chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large punitive damages award is likely to be reduced due to U.S. Supreme Court rulings that limit the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages to 9:1. The jury awarded a total of $2 billion in punitive damages and $55 million in compensatory damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the third consecutive U.S. jury verdict against the company in litigation over the chemical, which Bayer acquired as part of its $63 billion purchase of Monsanto last year. Both other jury verdicts also came in California, one in state court and one in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury in Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland on Monday said the company was liable for plaintiffs Alva and Alberta Pilliod’s contracting non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a spokeswoman for the couple said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It awarded $18 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to Alva Pilliod, and $37 million in compensatory and $1 billion in punitive damages to his wife, Alberta Pilliod. The jury found Roundup had been defectively designed, that the company failed to warn of the herbicide’s cancer risk and that the company acted negligently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German chemicals giant faces more than 13,400 U.S. lawsuits over the herbicide’s alleged cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next jury trial in the glyphosate litigation is scheduled for August in Missouri state court, the first time a jury outside of California will hear a Roundup case. The trial will take place in St. Louis County, where Monsanto’s former headquarters are located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayer in a statement on Monday said it was disappointed with the verdict and will appeal. A spokesman called the jury’s decision “excessive and unjustifiable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said both Alva and Alberta Pilliod had long histories of illnesses known to be substantial risk factors for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The contrast between today’s verdict and (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s) conclusion that there are ‘no risks to public health from the current registered uses of glyphosate’ could not be more stark,” Bayer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer says that decades of studies by the company and independent scientists have shown glyphosate and Roundup to be safe for human use. Bayer also points to several regulators around the world that found that glyphosate was not carcinogenic to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Wisner, a lawyer for the Pilliods, at a news conference following the verdict said Bayer had to take responsibility for its product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Monsanto keeps denying that it causes cancer and these two fine people here are casualties of that deception,” Wisner said, standing next to the California couple, who are in their 70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alberta Pilliod called on Bayer to add a warning label to Roundup, saying she and her husband would not have used the product had it alerted them to a cancer risk. “We’ve been fighting cancer for more than nine years now and we can’t do any of the things we wanted to do. We really resent Monsanto for that,” Pilliod said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior two jury verdicts against Bayer in U.S. Roundup trials triggered steep declines in Bayer shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A San Francisco state court jury in August 2018 awarded $289 million to a California groundskeeper, finding Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers caused his cancer. That award was later reduced to $78 million and is on appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded $80 million to another California man after finding Roundup caused his cancer. The company also said it would appeal that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, on Monday said it was too early to speculate about a potential settlement of the litigation by Bayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The legal questions on appeal in the previous two cases will ultimately inform how this litigation proceeds,” Zimmerman said. It also remains to be seen how juries in other part of the country react to the evidence in upcoming trials, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders have rebuked the company’s top management over its handling of the Monsanto acquisition and the litigation it inherited, which has wiped around 30 billion euros ($33.68 billion) from Bayer’s market value since the first jury verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pilliods allege the regular use of Roundup on their property between 1975 and 2011 caused them to develop cancers of the lymph system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They filed their lawsuit in 2017 after being diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and 2015, respectively. Both of them are currently in remission, but their trial had been expedited due to the risk of a relapse and potentially short life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs in the litigation allege that Monsanto had known about the herbicide’s cancer risk for decades, but failed to warn consumers and instead attempted to influence scientists and regulators to receive favorable assessments of its products. Bayer denies those allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits are largely based on a 2015 conclusion by the World Health Organization’s cancer arm, which classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2017 Reuters investigati&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-who-iarc-glyphosate-specialreport/in-glyphosate-review-who-cancer-agency-edited-out-non-carcinogenic-findings-idUSKBN1CO251&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; found that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer had dismissed and edited out &quot;non-carcinogenic&quot; findings that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. EPA, the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators have found that glyphosate is not likely carcinogenic to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>To Message Bus or Not: Distributed Systems Design (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/03/02/to-message-bus-or-not-distributed-systems-design/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/03/02/to-message-bus-or-not-distributed-systems-design/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Distributed system design is hard. There are many decisions that you need to make in the architecture early that have long reaching impacts. One of these decisions is how systems will communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will components expose RESTful APIs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will they interact with a messaging system (e.g. RabbitMQ, NATS, Kafka)? GRPC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will they share responses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that communication roughly falls into two schools: point to point and message bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an architecture driven by a message bus it allows more ubiquitous access to data. The consumers are allowed to determine how they will consume the data. It is not something decided by the sender. The power created by decoupling the producer and consumer, far outweighs any operational overhead introduced. Point to point is easier in some ways, but it silos the data off from the rest of the system. This can be a perk, security and isolation for instance, but building these walled gardens of data will hurt innovation, development pace, and monitoring in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.netlify.com/a94cdc19bc024781dee08ade593e8a4f89b9077d/4e2a1/img/blog/msg-styles.png&quot; alt=&quot;null&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often systems will use a hybrid of the two communication styles. For instance, we have a service that will take commands from a message bus, but are provided a callback URL where they can funnel the responses. It could have easily been that we just send messages back on the bus. We chose the hybrid approach because it fit the existing architecture better. We could have also stood up a proxy/load balancer that would have distributed the messages but looked like a single instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;point-to-point&quot;&gt;Point-to-Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In point to point, you’ll communicate between services directly. For instance, you’ll POST metrics directly to an endpoint, or funnel logs, or request an action. For scalability, you’ll often need to consider having multiple instances supporting that endpoint. To do this you’ll have some kind of load balancer or proxy. Setting up an maintaining proxies can be cumbersome, but they also provide a huge amount of power. Usually, you also have to address service discovery earlier in the system design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using load balancers to distribute load across multiple instances, is very helpful, arguably &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; when designing the system. Once in place it allows you to easily load multiple services into a box and provide a consistent port signature. However, the most powerful feature is the ability to fail an instance out of the load balancer. This allows the running production instance to stay running for troubleshooting while not compromising the integrity of the whole system. This flexibility is invaluable when you have a lot of services collaborating on a single logical request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback of a point-to-point communication structure is that the data is silo’d in the ecosystem from which it originates. The creator of the information determines how the data is used, by sending that data to a single point. This means that new crosscutting capabilities have to go fundamentally highjack that communication channel. They have to man-in-the-middle the receiver to get access to that data. Simple things like ‘how many requests is that service getting’ have to be built in and can’t be added afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;message-bus&quot;&gt;Message bus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a message bus will allow for the same communications, but it’s a little more simple. Single request/reply, worker pool, and broadcast models are supported out of the box. Service discovery is a matter of just sending messages to the right topics. There is an operational cost of maintaining the message bus, and possibly having a piece of infrastructure that impacts all services. But, all the production grade buses support clustering, but still things can go wrong and it can lock the whole system up (looking at you RabbitMQ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.netlify.com/2a4d35406fe181d43068d0aa699bfec90e7eb3a1/dad8f/img/blog/msg-patterns.png&quot; alt=&quot;undefined&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of a message bus architecture is that data is freely available. Services just provide data and don’t mandate how it is used. You still have the necessary coordination in developing a system; part a generates messages like this and part b will do that. But now you can have any new service start non-destructively consuming those messages. This free flow of data allows for rapid prototyping, simple services crosscutting, intuitive monitoring and easier development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example you can look at how Netlify collect metrics from across the system. Each of our services has a message bus connection logging, command &amp;amp; control, and metrics. We knew that each of the services would need to be pushing out metrics (read: counting things), but we weren’t sure where we would be storing them. Because the data was just on the bus I could easily create a few different services that took the data and pushed it to different storage engines. I was able to quickly side-by-side influxDB, redshift, dynamo and a 3rd party system with no modifications to the actual services. I built some quick command line utilities to tap into streams and run little experiments (e.g. validating counts, debugging, monitoring throughput).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these experiments are developed independently as I needed them. This flexibility let me ask a question and quickly answer it without potentially impacting the actual service. I could quickly look at real production data to answer any questions that came up. All of those perks is because the data wasn’t walled off, anyone with access to the message bus (which is secured) could look at the data without impacting other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a load balancer it is more difficult to leave an instance running but not communicating with the system directly. It requires specific code and for the end user to build this, not just configure the load balancer. There are also security concerns, once on the bus a consumer can start listening to data very easily. Enterprise messaging systems sometimes provide out of the box ACLs, but it is not in everyone. I would contend that this ease of access is far more valuable and worth the security considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;communicating-between-components&quot;&gt;Communicating between components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of ways to design communication systems in a distributed system. An architecture with a message bus as a core feature is very powerful. The decoupling between data creation and data consumption is invaluable in a growing system. New services can easily collaborate using the bus, and service agnostic tools (e.g. a message tailer) can interoperate easily. Point-to-point systems have some clear perks, but I think they’re outweighed by the capabilities created by a message bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinating disparate systems is complex to say the least, designing how they communicate is vital to there success. But, which school is best for your system? As is always the case with engineering, the answer is “it depends”. Hopefully this helps you qualify which is the best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stack Overflow lets Facebook track users across their sites</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Seeing as there's no official answer by the Network, I thought I'd pipe up and write a general answer on how users can protect themselves from this type of tracking and basically what I regard as privacy invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done some study/research on this and there's nothing private about the internet. Google and other sites also do this. Many companies have been forced to clean up their ways to an &quot;extent&quot;. Most end users are ignorant of what is being done with their data and the risk associated with what these sites view as non-PII (personal identifiable information) and how, in fact, the data can be matched (too long to get into) to reveal specific user details (including PII) without the user being aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manually select which cookies I'll accept on each site I visit. I have third-party cookies blocked and my browser set to remove cookies (with my selected exceptions) when I quit. I go through my cookies whenever I quit my browser and have been on new sites, or sites where I know the cookies are not removed when I quit, and I manually remove them. I can do this many times a day. I also closed all my social media accounts. Beyond this site having my real name, I'm entitled to my privacy and take it seriously. I prefer to have console errors or a page not to render properly than be tracked and harvested for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use an ad blocker and have for a long time. Some sites won't allow you to view pages with this active. If I'm desperate to see something I'll allow ads on that page. Websites are entitled to raise revenue, but I don't have to visit there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: Google was trying to patent the collection of user data few years back. Seriously! I use Google products, but with full awareness of what they do and regularly clear my usage histories. And as for Twitter et al, they're not better. All these sites are data mined for non-PII and put together and this data is utilised and sold. Sometimes information ends up on the Dark Web for sale. It's one of those things. Live your life so there's nothing you do that you will not be concerned about becoming public. Or do not use the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun Fact Two: I live in Australia and not only is our internet appalling, but our government shows a flagrant disrespect for basic human rights, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-10-02/proposed-surveillance-laws-draw-international-criticism/10300170&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;right to privacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
