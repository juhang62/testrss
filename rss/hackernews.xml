                    Alphabet's Google remains a dominant force in online advertising
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Google has been hit with a €1.49bn (£1.28bn) fine from the EU for blocking rival online search advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Google changed its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google owner Alphabet makes large amounts of money from advertising - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47125043&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;pre-tax profits reached $30.7bn&lt;/a&gt; (£23bn) in 2018, up from $12.66bn in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is illegal under EU anti-trust rules,&quot; said EC commissioner Margrethe Vestager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's global affairs head, Kent Walker, said: &quot;We've always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the EU competition authority &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44858238&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;hit Google with a record €4.34bn fine&lt;/a&gt; for using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;a €2.42bn fine in 2017&lt;/a&gt; for hindering rivals of shopping comparison websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;AdSense fine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said that websites often had an embedded search function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a consumer uses this, the website delivers both search results and search adverts, which appear alongside the search result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's &quot;AdSense for search&quot; product delivers those adverts for website publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission described Google as acting like &quot;an intermediary, like an advertising broker&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Google started to include &quot;exclusivity clauses&quot; in contracts which stopped publishers from placing ads from Google rivals such as Microsoft and Yahoo on search pages, the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2009, Google started replacing the exclusivity clauses with &quot;premium placement&quot; clauses, which meant publishers had to keep the most profitable space on their search results pages for Google's adverts and they had to request a minimum number of Google adverts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishers also needed to get written permission from Google before making any changes to how rival ads were displayed, letting Google control &quot;how attractive, and therefore clicked on, competing search adverts could be&quot;, the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Search giant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restrictive clauses &quot;led to a vicious circle&quot;, Ms Vestager said in a media conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Google's rivals, they were unable to grow, and to compete, and as a result of that, website owners had limited options for selling advertising space on those websites, and were forced solely to rely on Google,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts, except to keep rivals out of the market,&quot; she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2006 to 2016, Google had more than 70% of the search intermediation market in the EU. It generally had more than 90% of the search market and more than 75% of the online search advertising market, the Commission added.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cockpit voice recorder of Lion Air jet depicts pilots&amp;#039; frantic search for fix</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-crash-exclusive/exclusive-cockpit-voice-recorder-of-doomed-lion-air-jet-depicts-pilots-frantic-search-for-fix-sources-idUSKCN1R10FB</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-crash-exclusive/exclusive-cockpit-voice-recorder-of-doomed-lion-air-jet-depicts-pilots-frantic-search-for-fix-sources-idUSKCN1R10FB</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA/SINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - The pilots of a doomed Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX scrambled through a handbook to understand why the jet was lurching downwards in the final minutes before it hit the water killing all 189 people on board, three people with knowledge of the cockpit voice recorder contents said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation into the crash last October has taken on new relevance as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators grounded the model last week after a second deadly accident in Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators examining the Indonesian crash are considering how a computer ordered the plane to dive in response to data from a faulty sensor and whether the pilots had enough training to respond appropriately to the emergency, among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the second fatal accident, U.S. authorities are reviewing whether enough was done to ensure the plane was safe to fly, while attention has also focused on the training of the Lion Air crew and whether aeroplane manuals are clear enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the first time the voice recorder contents from the Lion Air flight have been made public. The three sources discussed them on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters did not have access to the recording or transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Lion Air spokesman said all data and information had been given to investigators and declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“FLIGHT CONTROL PROBLEM”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain was at the controls of Lion Air flight JT610 when the nearly new jet took off from Jakarta, and the first officer was handling the radio, according to a preliminary report issued in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two minutes into the flight, the first officer reported a “flight control problem” to air traffic control and said the pilots intended to maintain an altitude of 5,000 feet, the November report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first officer did not specify the problem, but one source said airspeed was mentioned on the cockpit voice recording, and a second source said an indicator showed a problem on the captain’s display but not the first officer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain asked the first officer to check the quick reference handbook, which contains checklists for abnormal events, the first source said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next nine minutes, the jet warned pilots it was in a stall and pushed the nose down in response, the report showed. A stall is when the airflow over a plane’s wings is too weak to generate lift and keep it flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain fought to climb, but the computer, still incorrectly sensing a stall, continued to push the nose down using the plane’s trim system. Normally, trim adjusts an aircraft’s control surfaces to ensure it flies straight and level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They didn’t seem to know the trim was moving down,” the third source said. “They thought only about airspeed and altitude. That was the only thing they talked about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co declined to comment on Wednesday because the investigation was ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20190320&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1368264005&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEF2J0F7&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;FILE PHOTO: Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) of a Lion Air JT610 that crashed into Tanjung Karawang sea is seen inside a special container after it was found under the sea, during a press conference at Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta, Indonesia, January 14, 2019.

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;REGULATORY SCRUTINY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Transportation Department’s inspector-general now plans to audit the FAA’s certification of the Boeing 737 MAX, while European and Canadian regulators say they want to make up their own minds whether a promised software upgrade is adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer has said that to handle the situation there is a documented procedure that must be memorized. A different crew on the same plane the evening before encountered the same problem but solved it after running through three checklists, according to the November report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they did not pass on all of the information about the problems they encountered to the next crew, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilots of JT610 remained calm for most of the flight, the three sources said. Near the end, the captain asked the first officer to fly while he checked the manual for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one minute before the plane disappeared from radar, the captain asked air traffic control to clear other traffic below 3,000 feet and requested an altitude of “five thou”, or 5,000 feet, which was approved, the preliminary report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the 31-year-old captain tried in vain to find the right procedure in the handbook, the 41-year-old first officer was unable to control the plane, two of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight data recorder shows the final control column inputs from the first officer were weaker than the ones made earlier by the captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is like a test where there are 100 questions and when the time is up you have only answered 75,” the third source said. “So you panic. It is a time-out condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian-born captain was silent at the end, all three sources said, while the Indonesian first officer said “Allahu Akbar”, or “God is greatest”, a common Arabic phrase in the majority-Muslim country that can be used to express excitement, shock, praise or distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane then hit the water, killing everyone on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CHANGES MADE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French air accident investigation agency BEA said on Tuesday the flight data recorder in the Ethiopian crash that killed 157 people showed “clear similarities” to the Lion Air disaster. Since the Lion Air crash, Boeing has been pursuing a software upgrade to change how much authority is given to the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, a new anti-stall system developed for the 737 MAX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. pilots have complained they were unaware of the new system, which is mentioned in the index of the aircraft’s full manual but not the text, according to a version seen by Reuters. Airlines have some discretion to customize the manuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the Lion Air crash has not been determined, but the preliminary report mentioned the Boeing system, a faulty, recently replaced sensor and the airline’s maintenance and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same aircraft the evening before the crash, a captain at Lion Air’s full-service sister carrier, Batik Air, was riding along in the cockpit and solved the similar flight control problems, two of the sources said. His presence on that flight, first reported by Bloomberg, was not disclosed in the preliminary report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also did not include data from the cockpit voice recorder, which was not recovered from the ocean floor until January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesian investigation agency KNKT, said last week the report could be released in July or August as authorities attempted to speed up the inquiry in the wake of the Ethiopian crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, he declined to comment on the cockpit voice recorder contents, saying they had not been made public.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Commento: Open-Source Disqus Alternative</title>
<link>https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/4957/what-is-commento-the-open-source-disqus-alternative</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.256kilobytes.com/content/show/4957/what-is-commento-the-open-source-disqus-alternative</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Commento is an open-source commenting platform developed by a programmer named Adhityaa Chandrasekar. The self-hosted version was launched in April 2017 and hosted service was released in February 2019. Commento is intended to offer a lightweight and private alternative to Disqus, Facebook Comments, and other commenting platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most commenting platforms, Commento can be embedded into your blog or website for readers to use. It includes many standard features, such as the ability to sticky comments to the top of the thread, upvote and downvote comments, nest threads and responses, markdown support for formatting text, and spam detection and other moderation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://demo.commento.io/#commento-login-box-container&quot;&gt;Here is a live Commento demo&lt;/a&gt; that allows potential new users to interact with the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what features Commento has in common with other platforms, what does it do differently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commento is lighter and faster than pretty much any comparable platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adhityaa Chandrasekar, who goes by “adtac” online, said the following in a Reddit thread promoting Commento:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11.850931677019&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every embedded Disqus frame makes about 90 network requests, injecting so many third-party tracking scripts. Facebook comments&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;equally worse with 1.5+ MB of data download.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commento is pretty lightweight and fast. The total payload is ~15 kB (and I'm working on reducing that to under 7 kB). The demo server is running on 240k of RAM. Benchmarking on a server 15,000 km away (behind&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;nginx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;) with&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;wrk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: it was able to handle 2k+ requests/second. It's dockerized too! :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/7fx99u/commento_is_a_lightweight_privacyfocused/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thread was made on November 27, 2017. Since then, adtac has succeeded in reducing download to just 11 kB and isn’t done yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-other-open-source-options&quot;&gt;What About Other Open Source Options?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even compared to other open source Disqus alternatives, such as Isso and Schnack, Commento is much faster and requires less download data and RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adtac provided the following comparisons in the aforementioned Reddit thread. As Commeto has only gotten smaller since then, it’s probable that this data has changed slightly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/giiN2UH.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://commento.io/&quot;&gt;The Commento website&lt;/a&gt; makes the following promise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Commento has not, does not, and will not gather your personal information to sell to advertisers, third-party trackers, or other organisations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many platforms rely on advertisements and selling personal to make revenue, Commento does not. Commento &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.commento.io/&quot;&gt;operates under the belief&lt;/a&gt; that once your private information is released, there is no way to undo this. Because of that, it is important to begin prioritizing privacy and safety before it becomes an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Commento is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;free and open-source&lt;/a&gt;, anyone can download the software from and host it on their own server. This can be a great option for people who are familiar with basic coding and server upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a paid version of Commento which &lt;a href=&quot;https://commento.io/pricing&quot;&gt;has very flexible payment options&lt;/a&gt;. People who purchase the service will have server hosting, updates, and security all taken care of for them. This is perfect for people that do not have the expertise or time to manage the server themselves. All plans (paid and self-hosted) have the same features included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger and more corporate services like Disqus typically have basic plans which are completely free and in which they host it on their servers. Why then, does Commento charge for theirs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adtac has explained that because servers take money to host and maintain, it is not sustainable to offer this service completely for free. Platforms like Disqus can afford to offer basic plans for free because they are making money from advertisements regardless. Again, Commento does not run ads or sell user info, so a small subscription fee is required to cover basic costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your personal views, paying $5 per month for the hosted service could be very worth it, considering the better speed, increased privacy, and knowledge that you are supporting open source software.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rules for Autocomplete</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posted on March 19, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rather than complain about them individually, I though I’d just write down the set of rules they often break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be cases where some of these rules aren’t the best thing to do, but there should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don’t apply if a field must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following these rules should always result in at very least a sane experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other options must always go below the one matching what they typed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with substring matches would almost always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence matching. This is only useful in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matches should be sorted alphabetically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When one option is the prefix of another, put the &lt;em&gt;shortest one first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options that differ only by case. In that case (pun intended), prefer the one that more closely matches the user’s input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term) must be a different key than the action to accept the first suggestion &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; you have to do something first to start using autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should never have to take extra steps to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use autocomplete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tab key should always accept the current autocomplete option, if there is one (whether it is highlighted in a dropdown or suggested inline).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an autocomplete selection is highlighted, pressing enter should always make use of that selection. It should never revert to a default selection, even if part of the page is loading. If something is still loading, it is better to ignore the enter press than to navigate to the wrong destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autocomplete should almost never activate on keypresses when the field using autocomplete is not focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The results should come in &amp;lt;100ms in the common case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s OK to pause autocompleting when the user is rapidly typing additional letters, but don’t show results from the middle of that burst of letters after the user has finished typing. It’s better to wait longer and change the results once than to show results that appear finished but aren’t. (I admit that this rule is quite subjective.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an option is highlighted, never change it, even if new data is loaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some optional features that make sense in certain kinds of autocompletion and not others. I’m sure there are more correct names for these features than what I listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show options I’ve used before when I focus the field but haven’t entered anything yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autocompletion to the nearest ambiguous prefix. If I type “g” and that matches both “Google” and “GoodReads”, this operation would fill in the two “o”s, allowing me to then type either “g” or “d” to select the option I want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multipart matching. This is useful for autocompleting file paths, where I might enter “e/b/a” to autocomplete “env/bin/activate”. &lt;code&gt;ZSH&lt;/code&gt; does this well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recursive matching. Since autocompletion sometimes serves dual purpose as a quick way to browse options, sometimes you want to start with a broad filter and then search within those results. For example, if I enter “.pdf” to see all pdf files, I can then hit some key (perhaps comma) to start searching within those results, even though what I am now typing actually appears in the name &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; what I typed previously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spelling correction. This tends to be useful in search engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases. When trying to autocomplete a username, the person’s first/last name could be allowed to autocomplete to their username. The same goes for state abbreviations suggesting the full state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional information in the results. If you are autocompleting function names, it is nice to see a list of the arguments they take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context-aware suggestions. This is useful when autocompleting code or a word (usually on a mobile phone) where the context is very predictive of what the desired result is likely to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it possible to go back to what I’ve typed after accepting an autocomplete suggestion. (The up arrow key tends to be a nice way to allow this.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>U.S. Firms Are Helping Build China’s Orwellian State</title>
<link>https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/962492-orwell-china-socialcredit-surveillance/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/962492-orwell-china-socialcredit-surveillance/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When a Dutch cybersecurity researcher disclosed last month that Chinese security contractor SenseNets left a massive facial recognition database tracking the movements of over 2.5 million people in China’s Xinjiang province unsecured on the internet, it briefly shone a spotlight on the alarming scope of the Chinese surveillance state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But SenseNets is a symptom of a much larger phenomenon: Tech firms in the United States are lending expertise, reputational credence, and even technology to Chinese surveillance companies, wittingly or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SenseNets database logged exact GPS coordinates on a 24-hour basis and, using facial recognition, associated that data with sensitive personal information, including national ID numbers, home addresses, personal photographs, and places of employment. Nearly one-third of the individuals tracked were from the Uighur minority ethnic group. In a bizarre juxtaposition of surveillance supremacy and security incompetence, SenseNets’ database was left open on the internet for six months before it was reported and, according to the researcher who discovered it, could have been “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2019/02/19/exposed-chinese-database-reveals-scope-of-citizen-surveillance/&quot;&gt;corrupted by a 12-year-old&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery suggests SenseNets is one of a number of Chinese companies participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/the-police-state-of-the-future-is-already-here&quot;&gt;the construction of a technology-enabled totalitarian police state&lt;/a&gt; in Xinjiang, which has seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/419855-state-dept-official-china-holding-800k-uighurs-others-in-internment&quot;&gt;as many as 2 million&lt;/a&gt; Uighurs placed into “re-education camps” since early 2017. Eyewitness reports from inside the camps describe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/former-inmates-of-chinas-muslim-re-education-camps-tell-of-brainwashing-torture/2018/05/16/32b330e8-5850-11e8-8b92-45fdd7aaef3c_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.1c2be44d87a6&quot;&gt;harsh living conditions&lt;/a&gt;, torture, and near constant political indoctrination meant to strip Uighurs of any attachment to their Islamic faith. Facial recognition, artificial intelligence, and speech monitoring enable and supercharge the Chinese Communist Party’s drive to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://jamestown.org/program/hu-the-uniter-hu-lianhe-and-the-radical-turn-in-chinas-xinjiang-policy/&quot;&gt;standardize&lt;/a&gt;” its Uighur population. Uighurs can be sent to re-education camps for &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/13/48-ways-to-get-sent-to-a-chinese-concentration-camp/&quot;&gt;a vast array of trivial offenses&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are benign expressions of faith&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The party monitors compliance through &lt;a href=&quot;https://livingotherwise.com/2018/07/31/happiest-muslims-world-coping-happiness/&quot;&gt;unrelenting electronic surveillance&lt;/a&gt; of online and physical activities. This modern-day panopticon requires enormous amounts of labor, but is serving as a testing ground for new technologies of surveillance that might render this process cheaper and more efficient for the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward this goal, the party is leveraging China’s vibrant tech ecosystem, inviting Chinese companies to participate through conventional government-procurement tools. Companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamestown.org/program/evidence-for-chinas-political-re-education-campaign-in-xinjiang/&quot;&gt;built the re-education camps&lt;/a&gt;. Companies supply the software that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/07/22/web-cleansing-chinas-xinjiang-residents-forced-install-surveillance-apps-mobile-phones/&quot;&gt;watches Uighurs online&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipvm.com/reports/xinjiang-dahua-hikvision&quot;&gt;the cameras that surveil their physical movements&lt;/a&gt;. While based in China, many are deeply embedded in the international tech community, in ways that raise serious questions about the misuse of critical new technologies. Foreign firms, eager to access Chinese funding and data, have rushed into partnerships without heed to the ways the technologies they empower are being used in Xinjiang and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2018, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-sensetime-announce-effort-advance-artificial-intelligence-research-0228&quot;&gt;wide-ranging research partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Chinese artificial-intelligence giant and global facial-recognition leader SenseTime. SenseTime then held a 49 percent stake in SenseNets, with robust cross-pollination of technical personnel. SenseNets’ parent company Netposa (also Chinese) has offices in Silicon Valley and Boston, received a strategic investment from Intel Capital in 2010, and has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sohu.com/a/227027090_114877.&quot;&gt;invested&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. robotics start-ups: Bito—led by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University—and Exyn, a drone software company competing in a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) artificial-intelligence challenge. This extensive enmeshing raises both moral and dual-use national-security questions. Dual-use technology is tech that can be put to both civilian and military uses and as such is subject to tighter controls. Nuclear power and GPS are classic examples, but new technologies such as facial recognition, augmented reality and virtual reality, 5G, and quantum computing are beginning to raise concerns about their dual applicability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond SenseNets, Chinese voice-recognition leader iFlytek &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/twelve-days-in-xinjiang-how-chinas-surveillance-state-overwhelms-daily-life-1513700355&quot;&gt;may also be&lt;/a&gt; supplying software to monitor electronic communications in Xinjiang. A 2013 iFlytek patent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/22/china-voice-biometric-collection-threatens-privacy&quot;&gt;identified by Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; specifically touted its utility in “monitoring public opinion.” Nonetheless, like SenseTime, iFlytek recently established &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2018/csail-launches-five-year-collaboration-with-iflytek-0615&quot;&gt;a multiyear research partnership&lt;/a&gt; with MIT. These partnerships lend reputational weight to activities that undermine freedom abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;Equally concerning is that the details of technical and research collaborations with Chinese companies can be opaque to international partners, concealing ethically objectionable activities.&lt;/span&gt; When Yale University geneticist Kenneth Kidd shared DNA samples with a scientific colleague from the Chinese Ministry of Public Security’s Institute on Forensic Science, he had no idea they would be used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-xinjiang-uighur-dna-thermo-fisher.html?emc=edit_th_190222&amp;amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;amp;nlid=878883400222&quot;&gt;refine genetic surveillance techniques in Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt;. Massachusetts-based company Thermo Fisher is also implicated: Until it was reported last month, the company sold DNA sequencers directly to authorities in Xinjiang for genetic mapping. Western companies and institutions must be far more vigilant in scrutinizing how Chinese partners are using their products, especially emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facial recognition is a good place to start. The industry needs to establish global standards for appropriate applications—use that respects human rights and the rule of law. In the United States, Microsoft has been an industry leader in calling for regulation and has tapped employees, customers, public officials, academics, and civil society groups to develop a set of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/06/facial-recognition-its-time-for-action/&quot;&gt;principles for facial recognition&lt;/a&gt;,” which it plans to launch formally this month. When it comes to building out regulation, the devil may be in the details. But the principles—fairness, transparency, accountability, nondiscrimination, notice and consent, and lawful surveillance—are sound. Surprisingly, SenseNets lists Microsoft itself as a partner on its website, along with American chip manufacturer AMD and high-performance computing provider Amax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of SenseNets, these partnerships could be false claims by a company looking to boost credibility, unwitting collaboration on the part of U.S. tech firms, or true business relationships. “We have been able to find no evidence that Microsoft is involved in a partnership with SenseNets,” a spokesperson for Microsoft told the authors, “We will follow up with SenseNets to cease making inaccurate representations about our relationship.” But if these partnerships are real, they would violate all six of Microsoft’s principles. California-based Amax, which specializes in high-performance computing for deep-learning applications, touts a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amaxchina.com/op/cms/uploads/files/SuccessCase-HIKVISION.pdf&quot;&gt;partnership with Chinese state-owned Hikvision&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s largest supplier of video surveillance products. AMD is also involved in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/china-producing-x86-chips-nearly-identical-to-amd-server-processors/&quot;&gt;Chinese joint venture&lt;/a&gt; supplying proprietary x86 processor technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/Xinjiang%20Uyghur%20Human%20Rights%20Act.pdf&quot;&gt;general awareness&lt;/a&gt; of the ways American companies and individuals are abetting surveillance in Xinjiang, U.S. Congress and government officials have yet to call for a review of the extent of U.S. investment and research partnership entanglements. The Commerce Department’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/11/19/2018-25221/review-of-controls-for-certain-emerging-technologies&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; rule-making on controls for certain emerging technologies is a start, but its scope remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international tech community can help guide the ethical application of its developments. After employee protests, Google reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/12/17/google-china-censored-search-engine-2/&quot;&gt;suspended plans to launch&lt;/a&gt; Dragonfly, a censored version of its search engine custom-built for China, although there are suspicions the project may not be entirely dead. Authoritarianism has proven it can use emerging technologies to undermine democratic norms and freedoms. As such, U.S.-based research-and-development organizations should perform basic due diligence on partnerships to assess their connection to surveillance regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International scientific exchange has yielded awe-inspiring achievements, from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson&quot;&gt;discovery of the Higgs boson&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.who.int/features/2010/smallpox/en/&quot;&gt;eradication of smallpox&lt;/a&gt;. And cooperation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2017-02-international-science-collaboration-astonishing.html&quot;&gt;growing faster than ever&lt;/a&gt;. But by taking basic steps to understand their partners, investors can mitigate some of the unintended risks of that cooperation. If they fail to do so, they will end up owning some of the responsibility for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Students don&amp;#039;t seem to be getting much out of higher education (2018)</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/whats-college-good-for/546590/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/whats-college-good-for/546590/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;have been in school&lt;/span&gt; for more than 40 years. First preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, and high school. Then a bachelor’s degree at UC Berkeley, followed by a doctoral program at Princeton. The next step was what you could call my first “real” job—as an economics professor at George Mason University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to tenure, I have a dream job for life. Personally, I have no reason to lash out at our system of higher education. Yet a lifetime of experience, plus a quarter century of reading and reflection, has convinced me that it is a big waste of time and money. When politicians vow to send more Americans to college, I can’t help gasping, “Why? You want us to waste even more?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, you may ask, can anyone call higher education wasteful in an age when its financial payoff is greater than ever? The earnings premium for college graduates has rocketed to 73 percent—that is, those with a bachelor’s degree earn, on average, 73 percent more than those who have only a high-school diploma, up from about 50 percent in the late 1970s. The key issue, however, isn’t whether college pays, but why. The simple, popular answer is that schools teach students useful job skills. But this dodges puzzling questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost: From kindergarten on, students spend thousands of hours studying subjects irrelevant to the modern labor market. Why do English classes focus on literature and poetry instead of business and technical writing? Why do advanced-math classes bother with proofs almost no student can follow? When will the typical student use history? Trigonometry? Art? Music? Physics? Latin? The class clown who snarks “What does this have to do with real life?” is onto something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disconnect between college curricula and the job market has a banal explanation: Educators teach what they know—and most have as little firsthand knowledge of the modern workplace as I do. Yet this merely complicates the puzzle. If schools aim to boost students’ future income by teaching job skills, why do they entrust students’ education to people so detached from the real world? Because, despite the chasm between what students learn and what workers do, academic success is a strong signal of worker productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose your law firm wants a summer associate. A law student with a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford applies. What do you infer? The applicant is probably brilliant, diligent, and willing to tolerate serious boredom. If you’re looking for that kind of worker—and what employer isn’t?—you’ll make an offer, knowing full well that nothing the philosopher learned at Stanford will be relevant to this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labor market doesn’t pay you for the useless subjects you master; it pays you for the preexisting traits you signal by mastering them. This is not a fringe idea. Michael Spence, Kenneth Arrow, and Joseph Stiglitz—all Nobel laureates in economics—made seminal contributions to the theory of educational signaling. Every college student who does the least work required to get good grades silently endorses the theory. But signaling plays almost no role in public discourse or policy making. As a society, we continue to push ever larger numbers of students into ever higher levels of education. The main effect is not better jobs or greater skill levels, but a credentialist arms race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lest I be misinterpreted, I emphatically affirm that education confers some marketable skills, namely literacy and numeracy. Nonetheless, I believe that signaling accounts for at least half of college’s financial reward, and probably more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the salary payoff for college comes from crossing the graduation finish line. Suppose you drop out after a year. You’ll receive a salary bump compared with someone who’s attended no college, but it won’t be anywhere near 25 percent of the salary premium you’d get for a four-year degree. Similarly, the premium for sophomore year is nowhere near 50 percent of the return on a bachelor’s degree, and the premium for junior year is nowhere near 75 percent of that return. Indeed, in the average study, senior year of college brings more than twice the pay increase of freshman, sophomore, and junior years combined. Unless colleges delay job training until the very end, signaling is practically the only explanation. This in turn implies a mountain of wasted resources—time and money that would be better spent preparing students for the jobs they’re likely to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2017/11/DIS_Lead_CollegeSpot/ecdd4f009.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Edmon de Haro
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;he conventional view—&lt;/span&gt;that education pays because students learn—assumes that the typical student acquires, and retains, a lot of knowledge. She doesn’t. Teachers often lament summer learning loss: Students know less at the end of summer than they did at the beginning. But summer learning loss is only a special case of the problem of fade-out: Human beings have trouble retaining knowledge they rarely use. Of course, some college graduates use what they’ve learned and thus hold on to it—engineers and other quantitative types, for example, retain a lot of math. But when we measure what the average college graduate recalls years later, the results are discouraging, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the United States Department of Education gave about 18,000 Americans the National Assessment of Adult Literacy. The ignorance it revealed is mind-numbing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/education/literacy-falls-for-graduates-from-college-testing-finds.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;Fewer than a third of college graduates&lt;/a&gt; received a composite score of “proficient”—and about a fifth were at the “basic” or “below basic” level. You could blame the difficulty of the questions—until you read them. Plenty of college graduates couldn’t make sense of a table explaining how an employee’s annual health-insurance costs varied with income and family size, or summarize the work-experience requirements in a job ad, or even use a newspaper schedule to find when a television program ended. Tests of college graduates’ knowledge of history, civics, and science have had similarly dismal results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, college students aren’t supposed to just download facts; they’re supposed to learn how to think in real life. How do they fare on this count? The most focused study of education’s effect on applied reasoning, conducted by Harvard’s David Perkins in the mid-1980s, assessed students’ oral responses to questions designed to measure informal reasoning, such as “Would a proposed law in Massachusetts requiring a five-cent deposit on bottles and cans significantly reduce litter?” The benefit of college seemed to be zero: Fourth-year students did no better than first-year students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other evidence is equally discouraging. One researcher tested Arizona State University students’ ability to “apply statistical and methodological concepts to reasoning about everyday-life events.” In the researcher’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the several hundred students tested, many of whom had taken more than six years of laboratory science … and advanced mathematics through calculus, almost none demonstrated even a semblance of acceptable methodological reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who believe that college is about learning how to learn should expect students who study science to absorb the scientific method, then habitually use it to analyze the world. This scarcely occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College students do hone some kinds of reasoning that are specific to their major. One ambitious study at the University of Michigan tested natural-science, humanities, and psychology and other social-science majors on verbal reasoning, statistical reasoning, and conditional reasoning during the first semester of their first year. When the same students were retested the second semester of their fourth year, each group had sharply improved in precisely one area. Psychology and other social-science majors had become much better at statistical reasoning. Natural-science and humanities majors had become much better at conditional reasoning—analyzing “if … then” and “if and only if” problems. In the remaining areas, however, gains after three and a half years of college were modest or nonexistent. The takeaway: Psychology students use statistics, so they improve in statistics; chemistry students rarely encounter statistics, so they don’t improve in statistics. If all goes well, students learn what they study and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that’s optimistic. Educational psychologists have discovered that much of our knowledge is “inert.” Students who excel on exams frequently fail to apply their knowledge to the real world. Take physics. As the Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who receive honor grades in college-level physics courses are frequently unable to solve basic problems and questions encountered in a form slightly different from that on which they have been formally instructed and tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for students of biology, mathematics, statistics, and, I’m embarrassed to say, economics. I try to teach my students to connect lectures to the real world and daily life. My exams are designed to measure comprehension, not memorization. Yet in a good class, four test-takers out of 40 demonstrate true economic understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;E&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;conomists’ educational bean counting&lt;/span&gt; can come off as annoyingly narrow. Non-economists—also known as normal human beings—lean holistic: We can’t measure education’s social benefits solely with test scores or salary premiums. Instead we must ask ourselves what kind of society we want to live in—an educated one or an ignorant one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal human beings make a solid point: We can and should investigate education’s broad social implications. When humanists consider my calculations of education’s returns, they assume I’m being a typical cynical economist, oblivious to the ideals so many educators hold dear. I am an economist and I am a cynic, but I’m not a typical cynical economist. I’m a cynical idealist. I embrace the ideal of transformative education. I believe wholeheartedly in the life of the mind. What I’m cynical about is people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m cynical about students. The vast majority are philistines. I’m cynical about teachers. The vast majority are uninspiring. I’m cynical about “deciders”—the school officials who control what students study. The vast majority think they’ve done their job as long as students comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who search their memory will find noble exceptions to these sad rules. I have known plenty of eager students and passionate educators, and a few wise deciders. Still, my 40 years in the education industry leave no doubt that they are hopelessly outnumbered. Meritorious education survives but does not thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, today’s college students are less willing than those of previous generations to do the bare minimum of showing up for class and temporarily learning whatever’s on the test. Fifty years ago, college was a full-time job. The typical student spent 40 hours a week in class or studying. Effort has since collapsed across the board. “Full time” college students now average 27 hours of academic work a week—including &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/07/04/what_happened_to_studying/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;just 14 hours spent studying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are students doing with their extra free time? Having fun. As Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa frostily remark in their 2011 book, &lt;em&gt;Academically Adrift&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we presume that students are sleeping eight hours a night, which is a generous assumption given their tardiness and at times disheveled appearance in early morning classes, that leaves 85 hours a week for other activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arum and Roksa cite a study finding that students at one typical college spent 13 hours a week studying, 12 hours “socializing with friends,” 11 hours “using computers for fun,” eight hours working for pay, six hours watching TV, six hours exercising, five hours on “hobbies,” and three hours on “other forms of entertainment.” Grade inflation completes the idyllic package by shielding students from negative feedback. The average GPA is now 3.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;W&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;hat does this mean&lt;/span&gt; for the individual student? Would I advise an academically well-prepared 18-year-old to skip college because she won’t learn much of value? Absolutely not. Studying irrelevancies for the next four years will impress future employers and raise her income potential. If she tried to leap straight into her first white-collar job, insisting, “I have the right stuff to graduate, I just choose not to,” employers wouldn’t believe her. To unilaterally curtail your education is to relegate yourself to a lower-quality pool of workers. For the individual, college pays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean, however, that higher education paves the way to general prosperity or social justice. When we look at countries around the world, a year of education appears to raise an individual’s income by 8 to 11 percent. By contrast, increasing education across a country’s population by an average of one year per person raises the national income by only 1 to 3 percent. In other words, education enriches individuals much more than it enriches nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1985/12/the-case-against-credentialism/308286/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;Credential inflation&lt;/a&gt;: As the average level of education rises, you need more education to convince employers you’re worthy of any specific job. One research team found that from the early 1970s through the mid‑1990s, the average education level within 500 occupational categories rose by 1.2 years. But most of the jobs didn’t change much over that span—there’s no reason, except credential inflation, why people should have needed more education to do them in 1995 than in 1975. What’s more, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; American workers’ education rose by 1.5 years in that same span—which is to say that a great majority of the extra education workers received was deployed not to get &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; jobs, but to get jobs that had recently been held by people with less education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As credentials proliferate, so do failed efforts to acquire them. Students can and do pay tuition, kill a year, and flunk their finals. Any respectable verdict on the value of education must account for these academic bankruptcies. Failure rates are high, particularly for students with low high-school grades and test scores; all told, about 60 percent of full-time college students fail to finish in four years. Simply put, the push for broader college education has steered too many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/the-war-on-stupid-people/485618/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;students who aren’t cut out for academic success&lt;/a&gt; onto the college track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/06/in-the-basement-of-the-ivory-tower/306810/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;college-for-all mentality&lt;/a&gt; has fostered neglect of a realistic substitute: vocational education. It takes many guises—classroom training, apprenticeships and other types of on-the-job training, and straight-up work experience—but they have much in common. All vocational education teaches specific job skills, and all vocational education revolves around learning by doing, not learning by listening. Research, though a bit sparse, suggests that vocational education raises pay, reduces unemployment, and increases the rate of high-school completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of traditional education often appeal to the obscurity of the future. What’s the point of prepping students for the economy of 2018, when they’ll be employed in the economy of 2025 or 2050? But ignorance of the future is no reason to prepare students for occupations they almost surely won’t have—and if we know anything about the future of work, we know that the demand for authors, historians, political scientists, physicists, and mathematicians will stay low. It’s tempting to say that students on the college track can always turn to vocational education as a Plan B, but this ignores the disturbing possibility that after they crash, they’ll be too embittered to go back and learn a trade. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/the-original-underclass/492731/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;vast American underclass&lt;/a&gt; shows that this disturbing possibility is already our reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education is so integral to modern life that we take it for granted. Young people have to leap through interminable academic hoops to secure their place in the adult world. My thesis, in a single sentence: Civilized societies revolve around education now, but there is a better—indeed, more civilized—way. If everyone had a college degree, the result would be not great jobs for all, but runaway credential inflation. Trying to spread success with education spreads education but not success.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Producing industrial hydrogen from biomass</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, every iteration produced the same result: the plow swept grass toward the center outlet, but rather than flowing nicely the grass was compressed and formed into a dense plug, completely jamming the system. Our attempts to increase the motor torque and push through the grass plug just resulted in a denser, more tenacious plug. Even though rotary plow hoppers work well for shoving through tough materials like coal, the compressibility of grass means that more gentle methods of persuasion are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idea #4: Vibrate the Grass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now the rest of the initial gasification system was ready for testing, but we still had no way to actually feed it grass. This was supposed to be the easy part!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dove into the research on solid flow handling again, this time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwDv3mwz3Y8&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Youtube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead of Semantic Scholar, and discovered bin activators. Bin activators have an internal baffle mounted above a funnel-like outlet with a small annular gap between (it’s a mouthful, just look at the picture below.) When first loaded, the material forms a bridge in the gap between the baffle and funnel. Then, an attached motor vibrates the assembly. This effectively fluidizes the stagnant material, allowing a controllable amount to freely flow through the annulus and into the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>There are many challenges associated with gasification, especially when it comes to gasification of grasses, which are preferable for their high yield and low cost per dry ton. The biggest challenges are ash slagging, acid gas removal, heat transfer into the grass, optimal moisture content, ash disp</og:description>
