<title>Google says Nest’s built-in mic not listed in specs was not meant to be secret</title>
<link>https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In early February, &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2019/02/04/nest-secure-google-assistant/&quot;&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; that its home security and alarm system Nest Secure would be getting an update. Users, the company said, could now enable its virtual-assistant technology, Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The problem: Nest users didn't know a microphone existed on their security device to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The existence of a microphone on the Nest Guard, which is the alarm, keypad, and motion-sensor component in the Nest Secure offering, was never disclosed in any of the product material for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, a Google representative told Business Insider the company had made an &quot;error.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs,&quot; the person said. &quot;That was an error on our part.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Nest Guard. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google says &quot;the microphone has never been on and is only activated when users specifically enable the option.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-to-be-folded-into-google-hardware-division-2018-2&quot;&gt;Google is reabsorbing Nest, the smart-home company it bought for $3.2 billion in 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It also said the microphone was originally included in the Nest Guard for the possibility of adding new security features down the line, like the ability to detect broken glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Still, even if Google included the microphone in its Nest Guard device for future updates — like its Assistant integration — the news comes as consumers have grown increasingly wary of major tech companies and their commitment to consumer privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For Google, the revelation is particularly problematic and brings to mind previous privacy controversies, such as the 2010 incident in which the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/15/google-admits-storing-private-data&quot;&gt;acknowledged that its fleet of Street View cars &quot;accidentally&quot; collected personal data&lt;/a&gt; transmitted over consumers' unsecured WiFi networks, including emails.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google bought Nest — which was initially known for its smart thermostat device — back in 2014 for $3.2 billion. It became a standalone company in 2015 when Google reorganized as Alphabet, but in February 2018 it was brought back into Google under the leadership of the head hardware exec Rick Osterloh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, Nest offers a variety of Internet of Things products including smoke detectors, video doorbells, and security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WiFi Hides Inside a USB Cable</title>
<link>https://hackaday.com/2019/02/18/wifi-hides-inside-a-usb-cable/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://hackaday.com/2019/02/18/wifi-hides-inside-a-usb-cable/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you weren’t scared of USB cables before, you should be now. The O.MG cable (or Offensive MG kit) from [MG] &lt;a href=&quot;https://mg.lol/blog/omg-cable/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hides a backdoor inside the shell of a USB connector&lt;/a&gt;. Plug this cable into your computer and you’ll be the victim of remote attacks over WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be asking what’s inside this tiny USB cable to make it susceptible to such attacks. That’s the trick: inside the shell of the USB ‘A’ connector is a PCB loaded up with a WiFi microcontroller — the documentation doesn’t say which one — that will send payloads over the USB device. Think of it as a BadUSB device, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.hak5.org/collections/physical-access/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USB Rubber Ducky from Hak5&lt;/a&gt;, but one that you can remote control. It is the ultimate way into a system, and all anyone has to do is plug a random USB cable into their computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years BadUSB — &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackaday.com/2014/10/05/badusb-means-were-all-screwed/&quot;&gt;an exploit hidden in a device’s USB controller itself&lt;/a&gt; — was released upon the world, [MG] has been tirelessly working on making his own malicious USB device, and now it’s finally ready. The O.MG cable hides a backdoor inside the shell of a standard, off-the-shelf USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of this device is quite impressive, in that it fits entirely inside a USB plug. But this isn’t a just a PCB from a random Chinese board house: [MG] spend 300 hours and $4000 in the last month putting this project together with a Bantam mill and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1090486321456414725&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;created his own PCBs, with silk screen&lt;/a&gt;. That’s impressive no matter how you cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future updates to this cable that will hack any computer might include a port of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/exploitagency/ESPloitV2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ESPloitV2&lt;/a&gt;, an Open Source WiFi controlled USB HID keyboard emulator. That will bring a lot of power to this device that’s already extremely capable. In the video &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1094389042685259776&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attached to this tweet&lt;/a&gt; you can see the O.MG cable connected to a MacBook, with [MG] opening up a webpage remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Leukemia Has Won</title>
<link>https://alex.blog/2019/02/18/leukemia-has-won/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://alex.blog/2019/02/18/leukemia-has-won/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my best efforts over the past two and a half years, the leukemia has won. Due to liver inflammation and&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease&quot;&gt; GvHD,&lt;/a&gt; the liver is too damaged to continue with treatment and there are no further options. I don’t want to spend the rest of my time in the hospital so I am choosing to remain at home where I can be comfortable with family and friends. If you want to read more about my journey through all of this, here are all of my posts with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alex.blog/tag/cancer/&quot;&gt;cancer tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all of my plugins are open-source, they are free to be forked by reputable authors in the WordPress community. It would mean a lot to have my legacy go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone who has given me moral support through these difficult times. It has meant a lot hearing all of the love and support pour in from my friends and colleagues from around the world. I have been so grateful for all of the opportunities that have been given to me in my life, professionally and personally. Automatticians have really helped me grow professionally by giving me an amazing career for the past nine years. My car friends have helped me grow socially and provided me so many good memories and life experiences. The people that I have gotten to know in the WordPress community have been very supportive as well. I am amazed by how many friends I have made and how much they have been there for me. They all have enriched my life and helped me grow as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Boeing 787 Reaches 801 MPH as a Jet Stream Packs Record-Breaking Speeds</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-sn-jet-stream-flight-20190219-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-sn-jet-stream-flight-20190219-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For the jet stream to get cranking this much, there must be a big storm brewing somewhere, right? Surprisingly, it's the opposite (the closest developing storminess is in the western Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday). Storms cause the jet stream to bend, cresting and dipping into waves that ride across the Lower 48. Just like kinking a garden hose, it causes the flow speed to decline. In the absence of large-scale weather systems, a zonal west-to-east jet is free to gather considerable speed, much like how we reach our fastest highway speeds on straightaways.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Public protest against Amazon</title>
<link>http://www.churyumov.com/2019/02/public-protest-against-amazon.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.churyumov.com/2019/02/public-protest-against-amazon.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
Bro! I am calling you Bro even if we don’t know each other. This is because both of us could work for Amazon. That means both of us suffer from fascism culture of Amazon. You might not agree with me. If you like your company and happy with your job, you are lucky. But don’t lose discretion. In 2017 I got job offer for software engineer in Amazon and was happy like you. Nice company, nice salary, nice team members. At that time, I didn’t assume the horror hidden inside of the glossybox.&lt;br/&gt;I didn’t hear about NYT article describing how Amazon persecutes employees because of their association with disabled and dying relatives. I didn’t know the Internet is full of stories of that kind. To somehow improve its reputation, Amazon manipulates public opinion on the Internet! Amazon pays to its employees for posts in social networks! Don’t believe? Google it!&lt;br/&gt;My name is Oleg Churyumov. In 2017, I left a negative feedback about my manager Uwais Khan in the daily “Amazon Connect” survey. Amazon Connect team sent to me the report showing how my manager can calculate my answer. At our 1:1 meeting, Khan prohibited me to leave feedback in the system. Since then oppression started.&lt;br/&gt;Khan asked me to work on weekends. Then he asked HR how to prevent me from immigration benefits (not informing me about that).&lt;br/&gt;Every Amazon engineer is entitled with internal transfer opportunity. I realized this can be the only way to stay in the company and avoid oppression. I asked Khan about internal transfer to another team in NY. Khan said, I can do that as soon as my wife finds job there. My wife spent 3 months on hard search and interviews. She got a job offer in NY, signed new lease there and moved with one of our children. I informed Khan about that and he said he changed his opinion. He forced me to stay in Seattle with my second child. Khan made me single parent.&lt;br/&gt;Amazon sponsored my working EB3 visa. This allowed me to apply for residency in US simultaneously with my another non-stable immigration status. I could not quit job immediately, because then I would lose application for this visa. Engineers call this “working visa slavery”. Amazon knows employees will not strike oppression. Because “at will” job contract allows immediate termination with no reason. Most of Amazon engineers are immigrants who lose immigration H1B status once they are terminated. Many IT companies provide immigration sponsorship. However, none of them is so impudent like Amazon to use this for oppression.&lt;br/&gt;My 3 yo daughter has a development delay and I need to bring her to therapy. For that, I asked Khan for work from home once a week like everybody else in our team. Khan prohibited me to work from home. Moreover, he asked me to come to office at 7 am and sit there alone. All the other team members came to office at 11 am and worked from home without restrictions. And their children were not disabled.&lt;br/&gt;One day my daughter became seriously sick. Violating Khan’s prohibitions, I took 2 days leave to take care of her. Khan punished me for that. He sent email listing missed work during these days as a my fault.&lt;br/&gt;In April of 2018 I got nice Forte performance review. Next month I complained to HR about tortures by Khan. I didn’t know, employees say on Internet that Amazon HR does not to protect employees. Amazon HR protects company from employees. HR specialist Edwin Mwango performed investigation and confirmed most of the facts I spoke about. However, Mwango said Khan didn’t violate Amazon policies.&lt;br/&gt;Immediately after HR investigation, Khan retaliated and placed me on “pivot” (termination procedure). During the pivot, I chose “appeal” option to speak in front of independent random employees. HR responsible for appeal at pivot was Annalisa Perez. Perez prohibited me to tell about tortures and retaliation during the appeal. This proves that “pivot” is a fiction to create a visibility of justice. In fact, there is no justice in Amazon. If employee files lawsuit, Amazon says: “During the appeal at pivot another independent employees confirmed the termination. There is no bias of his manager” However, Amazon does not say that appellant is prohibited to at appeal. Pivot appeal is a fake.&lt;br/&gt;I complained to current HRBP Andrew Berg, Khan’s supervisor Joe Resudek and even Jeff Bezos. Same month, Resudek announced Khan is promoted. Berg met with me and Khan and laughed at my words. As I expected, Bezos never responded. Amazon blocked me access to its buildings.&lt;br/&gt;You can say: “What can you change? You are alone, weak and poor. Amazon is big and strong, Jeff Bezos is a billionaire.” I have an answer. Amazon is a big and fat behemoth. It is getting fatter because it has no natural enemies. It has a lot of fat but it has no strong skeleton. It is a castle made of sand. There is a huge labor turnover. Nobody works here for idea, mission or something apart from money or immigration status. Everybody pretends he shares Amazon principles.&lt;br/&gt;There are weapons against behemoths. These weapons are true and civil rights. We need to remember name of our region: King County of Washington state. I am sure Martin Luther King and George Washington heard many times “You can't do that”. As well as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;br/&gt;You can say: “Ok, but what do you want?”. I have an answer. I want Bezos to stop lying about his “zero tolerance” to the oppression. Or he should start implementing this “zero tolerance”. I want Amazon to change its policies and procedures. I want every Amazon engineer and other employees who meet such oppression to know: they are not alone. One day other guy will say: “No”. And then another guy. And then another. Bezos can't hide the true behind his billions indefinitely. He can’t buy everybody with all his money.&lt;br/&gt;I don't know when it happens. Maybe 1 year. Maybe more. But I have plenty of time. I will stay here until the end. It is a pleasure for me to make a small input to fight against oppression.&lt;br/&gt;One Amazon employee said when her father was dying, her boss told “you are the problem” and prevented her from visiting the father. Another Amazon employee saw his unborn child died during pregnancy when he was under oppression by his manager. There are a lot of cases like that. Amazon is built on blood.&lt;br/&gt;Hero of famous movie was right. When I will be 80 yo dying in warm bed I will remember tens of years I spent at work making Bezos richer. Would I exchange all these years for just one chance? One chance to stay here and tell to Bezos: “Your billions don't give you a right to kill our children”.&lt;br/&gt;If you don’t agree with me or think I am an idiot that’s ok. I am glad you and your family don’t suffer. And I hope they will not. But you are welcome to come to me and talk. Ask any questions. Tell me your experience, argue and say I am not right. I will be glad to talk to you regardless of your support, provide any explanations and evidence.&lt;br/&gt;Every working day I will stay in front of one of Amazon buildings in Seattle with a banner for few hours. I will do this indefinitely. If you want to locate me, text to my Facebook (Oleg Churyumov).&lt;br/&gt;God bless you&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.churyumov.com/2019/02/02062019.html&quot;&gt;Next day of protest&lt;/a&gt;

<title>Dear OpenAI: Please Open Source Your Language Model</title>
<link>https://thegradient.pub/openai-please-open-source-your-language-model/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thegradient.pub/openai-please-open-source-your-language-model/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This past Valentine's day, OpenAI dropped two &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;bombshells&lt;/a&gt;: a new, state-of-the-art language model and the end of its love affair with open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context: in what has been dubbed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/nlp-imagenet/&quot;&gt;&quot;Imagenet moment for Natural Language Processing&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have been training increasingly large language models and using them to &quot;transfer learn&quot; other tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis. Examples include &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146&quot;&gt;fast.ai's ULMFit&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/&quot;&gt;OpenAI's GPT&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365&quot;&gt;AI2's ELMO&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805&quot;&gt;Google's BERT&lt;/a&gt; , and now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;GPT-2&lt;/a&gt;, a scaled up version of the original Generative Pre-Training Transformer (GPT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-18-at-12.31.08-AM.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; Classic Reddit snark. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/aqwcyx/discussion_openai_should_now_change_their_name_to/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is surprising about OpenAI publishing new research with impressive results. What makes this announcement special is OpenAI's deliberate decision not to fully open source their work , citing fears that their technology would be misused for &quot;malicious applications&quot; such as spam or fake news. This sparked a debate on online forums like Twitter and Reddit, as well as a flurry of media coverage on how AI research was becoming &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90308169/openai-refuses-to-release-software-because-its-too-dangerous&quot;&gt;too&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/14/elon-musk-backed-ai-writes-convincing-news-fiction&quot;&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-backed-ai-company-claims-it-made-a-text-gener-1832650914&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ai-text-generator-too-dangerous-to-make-public/&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While OpenAI is correct to be concerned about potential misuse, I disagree with their decision not to open source the GPT-2. To justify this, I first argue that only certain types of dangerous technology should be controlled by suppressing access. Then, on the basis of this analysis, I argue that &lt;strong&gt;withholding the full GPT-2 model is both unnecessary for safety reasons and detrimental to future progress in AI&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I broadly classify modern technology with potential for misuse as either &lt;em&gt;destructive&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;deceptive&lt;/em&gt; technology. &lt;em&gt;Destructive&lt;/em&gt; technologies operate primarily in the physical realm. Think chemical weapons, lab-engineered super viruses, lethal autonomous weapons, or the atom bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/51XX-NhcRDL._SY355_-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; The &quot;destroyer of worlds&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XX%2BNhcRDL._SY355_.jpg&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;deceptive&lt;/em&gt; technologies operate primarily in the realm of our minds and can potentially be misused to manipulate and control people on a broad scale. Think &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake&quot;&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;, Photoshop, or looking back in history, the Internet or the printing press. With the notable exception of autonomous weapons, fears around AI misuse tend to fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/2018-06-05-image-39.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; Deepfakes allow actors to superimpose facial expressions onto other people's faces. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2018/06/2018-06-05-image-39.jpg&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sufficiently dangerous destructive technologies, the only way to protect society is to heavily restrict &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/report/us-nuclear-weapons-policy&quot;&gt;access&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. Uranium for nuclear weapons) and knowledge (e.g. instructions for creating antibiotic-resistant bacteria). Merely refusing to publish the details around a dangerous technology is insufficient without other control mechanisms: the rapid pace of technological progress ensures that, unless research is forcefully stopped by some external force, any discovery will be independently replicated in a matter of years, if not months. Suppressing a technology in this fashion is extremely heavy-handed and far from foolproof. There is always some chance that a terrorist will scrounge up enough radioactive material to make a crude dirty bomb, but we currently have no other choice: Earth would be a graveyard if an atom bomb could be assembled from parts and instructions easily obtainable online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with deceptive technologies, there is an alternative, more effective option. Instead of suppressing a technology, &lt;strong&gt;make knowledge of its power as public as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; While counterintuitive, this method of control relies on realizing that deceptive technologies lose most of their powers if the public is broadly aware of the potential for manipulation. While knowledge of nuclear weapons will not save me from fallout, awareness of recent advances in speech synthesis  will make me significantly more skeptical that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-LRckZcsCE&quot;&gt;Obama can speak Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. Bullets do not discriminate on one's beliefs, but my knowledge of modern photo editing makes it difficult to convince me that Putin is capable of riding a bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/maxresdefault-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; You can find photos of Putin riding nearly anything online (&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-TXBxxPAtb0/maxresdefault.jpg&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a specific example, we can look at a technology that has (thankfully) not destroyed modern society despite its potential for chaos: Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;photoshopacasestudy&quot;&gt;Photoshop: A Case Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the camera was invented in the 1800s, it was heralded as a new, impartial way to record history. Instead of relying on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/&quot;&gt;unreliable&lt;/a&gt; secondhand accounts, people could directly glimpse an impartial record of the past and relive the moment for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/image-placeholder-title.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; Stalin literally erased his political enemies from historical photographs. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTU3ODc4NjAzNTIxNzMwMjcx/image-placeholder-title.webp&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of photography, it was not widely known that photos could be manipulated. The infamous dictator Joseph Stalin capitalized on this ignorance to literally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/josef-stalin-great-purge-photo-retouching&quot;&gt;rewrite&lt;/a&gt; history in his own favor. Personal enemies were executed and then erased from photographs of important historical events, with none to know better. Political propaganda was photoshopped onto signs held by protesters, manufacturing support for political ideologies where none existed. Such techniques allowed Stalin to imprison and execute &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.stanford.edu/2010/09/23/naimark-stalin-genocide-092310/&quot;&gt;millions of citizens&lt;/a&gt; without losing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-18-at-12.18.26-AM-1.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; The rewritten text supports the Bolshevik revolution with phrases like &quot;down with the monarchy&quot;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbth.com/history/329317-stalin-propaganda-photos&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon Photoshop's release in 1988, people were naturally worried that open access to photo editing technology would have severe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/05/photography-in-the-age-of-falsification/377107/&quot;&gt;potential&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ford-workers-angry-as-blacks-are-whited-out-1320079.html&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;. Thirty years later, society has emerged relatively unscathed despite Photoshop being simple enough for high school students to use and ubiquitous enough to commandeer its own verb. Why? &lt;strong&gt;Precisely because everyone knows about Photoshop.&lt;/strong&gt; To a population largely inoculated to its power, Photoshop is useful only for pranks, making absentee friends feel included in group outings, and the occasional, short-lived publicity stunt. To a population that believed that photos were an unalterable snapshot of reality as did most a hundred years ago, photo editing was the ultimate propaganda. Oh the difference information can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While recent advances in voice, text, and image generation  may cause some to fear that an apocalypse is right around the corner, I suspect that these technologies will follow a similar trend to Photoshop: society will simply learn to become more skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/CeF4p1ZUEAIgtmC.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; The above photo is photoshopped and not real. Would you have believed it? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/catvalente/status/711982878616195072&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysisofgpt2&quot;&gt;Analysis of GPT-2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing text generation specifically, OpenAI justifies the danger the GPT-2 might pose by selecting a handful of model-generated stories. For convenience, I have copied the prompt and first two paragraphs of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/&quot;&gt;example story&lt;/a&gt; on unicorns below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROMPT:&lt;/strong&gt; In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MODEL:&lt;/strong&gt; The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid's Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science. Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note here that in addition to running the model a few times and hand-picking the best sample, the prompt is also itself cherry-picked. In particular, prompting on unicorns that speak English can easily mask deeper issues: generated sentences that would usually be considered nonsense may &quot;fit&quot; with a nonsensical prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even considering the above, this short sample &lt;strong&gt;still has severe coherence flaws&lt;/strong&gt;. The first sentence implies that the unicorns have a single horn, while the second suggests that they have four. Additionally, while the prompt implies that the unicorn discovery is recent news, the third sentence implies that the unicorns were discovered two centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound like nitpicking , but I think it is evidence of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/the-limitations-of-visual-deep-learning-and-how-we-might-fix-them/&quot;&gt;deeper issue&lt;/a&gt; common to many deep learning models: &lt;strong&gt;GPT-2 doesn't have true &quot;understanding&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; of the text it is generating. It is &lt;em&gt;extremely easy&lt;/em&gt; to generate sentences that look presentable at a glance. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elsewhere.org/journal/pomo/&quot;&gt;postmodernist essay generator&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatsmathematics.com/mathgen/&quot;&gt;Mathgen&lt;/a&gt; use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar&quot;&gt;context free grammars&lt;/a&gt; to generate &quot;grammatically correct&quot; sentences without any semantic meaning. After all, to someone unfamiliar with mathematics, both of the equations below look like gibberish anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}&lt;br/&gt;\frac{{\partial ^2 B}}{{\partial x^2 }} = \frac{1}{{c^2 }}\frac{{\partial ^2 B}}{{\partial t^2 }}&lt;br/&gt;\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}&lt;br/&gt;\frac{1}{O ( {D^{(Y)}} )} \ge \prod_{\Psi \in V} \iint_{\emptyset}^{0} \tan \left(-e \right) + \overline{\frac{1}{0}}.&lt;br/&gt;\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating valid sentences is easy. Generating coherence is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further examination of a raw dump of non cherry-picked &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/gpt-2/master/gpt-2-samples/unconditional-topk40.txt&quot;&gt;outputs&lt;/a&gt; reveals similar issues. To be fair to OpenAI, GPT-2's generations are a cut above any other generative language models I have seen, but we are still a &lt;strong&gt;long ways away from human level coherence.&lt;/strong&gt; Crucially, none of the samples shown by OpenAI are at a level where they can be directly misused by a malicious agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it isn't obvious that the GPT-2 is superior to its open sourced sister language models. While BERT  ran ablations to show that their bidirectional encoders provided performance gains over unidirectional language models like the GPT  independent of model size, OpenAI has yet to publish any such comparisons to other existing models. Since they also do not fine-tune their model, we are also unable to directly compare performance on downstream tasks like summarization or translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may counter that open sourcing the complete model is &lt;em&gt;unnecessary&lt;/em&gt;, and that it is sufficient to merely disclose the research result. This is mistaken in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI research has exploded in part due to open source, as researchers can iterate on existing research in the blink of an eye instead of having to rebuild prior work from scratch. As one of the most influential organizations in AI research, OpenAI's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/baselines&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gym&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/retro&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/InfoGAN&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/spinningup&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; has undoubtedly inspired others to do the same. If OpenAI's new policy reverses this trend, other researchers may follow suit, &lt;strong&gt;threatening to end the culture of open source&lt;/strong&gt; that has brought so much benefit to our field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, open source encourages the spread of information to the general public. With open source, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/&quot;&gt;thispersondoesnotexist.com&lt;/a&gt; made it to the top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/this-person-does-not-exist&quot;&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt;. With open source, artists produced the first AI-generated art piece sold at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx&quot;&gt;major art auction&lt;/a&gt;. While OpenAI's research blog is only read by ardent machine learning practitioners, work built on open source can reach a much wider audience that is unlikely to have seen the original research announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thegradient.pub/content/images/2019/02/edmond-de-belamy-framed-cropped.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;/&gt; This GAN generated portrait sold for nearly half a million dollars last year. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.christies.com/media-library/images/features/articles/2018/08/09/a-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine/edmond-de-belamy-framed-cropped.jpg?w=780&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source also ensures research legitimacy. In a field littered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#The_first_AI_winter_1974%E2%80%931980&quot;&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence#Bust:_the_second_AI_winter_1987%E2%80%931993&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;, it is of paramount importance that researchers can replicate extraordinary claims by examining the open sourced code. OpenAI's reputation ensures that no one will question this particular result regardless of whether it is open sourced, but this reputation is built upon excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/retro&quot;&gt;prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/roboschool&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/baselines&quot;&gt;sourced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/gym&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that even if you do not lie, others will, and without a way to verify, it becomes impossible for either researchers or the public to see through the smoke and the mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that everything should be open sourced without a second thought. Sufficiently dangerous technologies of the destructive kind should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be made easily accessible. Even for particularly dangerous technologies of the deceptive kind, it may be advisable to add a small delay between paper publication and code release to prevent a fast-reacting malicious actor from swooping in before the public has had time to fully process the new results. If OpenAI believes that the GPT-2 is such a result, I would advocate that &lt;strong&gt;they commit to open sourcing their model by a specific date in the near future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI research has benefited substantially from an open source culture. While most other disciplines lock state-of-the-art research behind expensive paywalls, anyone with an internet connection can access the same cutting edge AI research as Stanford professors, and running experiments is as simple as cloning an open source repository and renting a GPU in the cloud for only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://course.fast.ai/#using-a-gpu&quot;&gt;few cents an hour&lt;/a&gt;. Our dedication towards democratizing AI by publicly releasing &lt;a href=&quot;http://cs231n.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;learning material&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, and most importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google-research/bert&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan&quot;&gt;sourcing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq&quot;&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/baselines&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; is why we have progressed so rapidly as a field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I commend OpenAI for their fantastic new research pushing the limits of language modeling and text generation. I also thank them for their deliberate thought and willingness to engage in a much needed discussion on research ethics, something the AI field does not often talk about despite its paramount importance. OpenAI was correct to raise questions regarding misuse of AI but incorrect to use this as a justification to not open source its research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope that 2019 will not be the inflection point where machine learning shifts from being an open system to a closed one that is neither safer nor conducive to progress as a field. OpenAI, for the sake of our future, please open source your language model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: Alec Radford graciously pointed out that I linked the wrong page of sample GPT-2 outputs. In light of this, the raw samples are much closer to the cherry-picked stories and the article now reflects that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Could &amp;#039;Oumuamua be an icy fractal aggregate ejected from a protoplanetary disk?</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/no-oumuamua-is-not-an-alien-spaceship-it-might-be-even-weirder</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Not to put too fine a point on it, but what the frak is 'Oumuamua?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you remember 'Oumuamua. It caused quite a stir last year; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/breaking-have-astronomers-discovered-our-first-interstellar-visitor-note-not-aliens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first seen in late 2017 by the Pan-STARRS survey telescope in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, it was quickly found to have a very unusual orbit. Instead of the usual ellipse or circle around the Sun like normal solar system objects, it was found to have a &lt;em&gt;hyperbolic&lt;/em&gt; orbit. That means &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/breaking-have-astronomers-discovered-our-first-interstellar-visitor-note-not-aliens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it was moving too quickly to be bound to the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, in turn, means it came from Out There. Like &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; out there: interstellar space, the void between the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent observations confirmed it: 'Oumuamua was just passing through the solar system, with so much extra velocity (about 25 km/sec) that it was moving faster than the Sun's escape velocity. This was a one-time visitor, screaming through the solar system and heading back out into The Black once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-container media-container--view-mode--syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-container--type--video&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-youtube-video media-element file-syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-youtube-1&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;media-youtube-player&quot; id=&quot;media-youtube-q4etuh1o7ac&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; title=&quot;A2017U1 animation&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4EtUH1O7ac?wmode=opaque&amp;amp;controls=&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;playerapiid=media-youtube-q4etuh1o7ac&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video of A2017U1 animation&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was certainly enough to make it the object of intense scrutiny. We'd never seen something from interstellar space pass through the solar system before! But what was it? At first it was classified as a comet, then an asteroid, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/so-oumuamua-is-likely-a-comet-after-all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;then maybe a comet&lt;/a&gt; again (this confusion is reflected in its provisional designations; at first it was A/2017 U1, for &quot;asteroid&quot;, then C/2017 U1, for &quot;comet&quot;, then finally I/2017 U1, for &quot;interstellar&quot;). It was hard to tell &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it was; it was too small, faint, and far away to get good observations, and worse, it was only seen on its way out, so it was farther from us literally every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another very weird thing happened: More observations allowed a better determination of its trajectory, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/so-oumuamua-is-likely-a-comet-after-all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it was found that it wasn't slowing down fast enough&lt;/a&gt;. As it moves away, the Sun's gravity pulls on it, slowing it down … but it wasn't slowing down &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some force was acting on it, accelerating it very slightly. Comets are made of rock and ice, so maybe the ice was turning into gas, and as this was blown off it acted like a very gentle rocket. The problem with this is that no such venting was detected. If it were like comets in our solar system, you'd expect to see lots of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) coming from it, but none was seen. So maybe it was some other kind of ice, like water. But again, if it is like our local comets, it would take so much water that we'd have noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's when a couple of astronomers posited something interesting: Maybe this force was radiation pressure, literally the force of sunlight hitting it and giving it a tiny push. That makes some sense, but for the math to work out with the acceleration seen, 'Oumuamua had to be flat. Like, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; flat: So thin that it looked more like a solar sail, a very thin sheet of material designed to catch sunlight and accelerate. But that, in turn, meant that 'Oumuamua was artificial. As in, a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the obvious (it seems like a big leap!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/is-oumuamua-an-interstellar-spaceship-im-still-going-with-no&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I have my problems with this idea&lt;/a&gt;. Not much has changed with that hypothesis since I wrote that, and while I wouldn't dismiss it being an alien probe out of hand, the evidence doesn't support that conclusion, and in fact points against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I ask again: What the frak is 'Oumuamua?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04100.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A new paper has come&lt;/a&gt; out that might have a solution, and it's really clever. Maybe 'Oumuamua's not flat. Maybe it's &lt;em&gt;fluffy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the astronomers speculated it might be a thin and flat, giving it a large area like a sail, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11490.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;they had to assume a density for it&lt;/a&gt;. That's because the amount of pressure sunlight exerts is very small, so if an object is massive it has to be spread out very thin and big to catch enough sunlight to accelerate it enough to match the observations. So they assumed it had some normal density like 1 – 3 grams per cubic centimeter (roughly somewhere between the density of water to rock).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new paper turns that around. Instead of assuming a density to find the area, let's assume the size determined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/basteroid&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;using normal methods&lt;/a&gt; is correct, use that to get an area, and from there get the density needed to match the observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a size for 'Oumuamua of 50 – 130 meters, what they get is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; low density: About 0.00005 grams per cc. That's &lt;strong&gt;incredibly&lt;/strong&gt; low, and at first it seems ridiculously so. That's 100 times less dense than air! No solid object could have a density that low!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… so what if it's not solid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying it's hollow, but maybe it's really porous. Like Styrofoam or Swiss cheese, but much much holey-er. Is there anything natural like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, surprisingly, yes. When stars are very young, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/hey-we-were-right-planets-found-around-the-baby-star-hd-163296&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;they have a huge disk of material swirling around them&lt;/a&gt;; it's from this material that planets form. Out far from the star, where temperatures in the disk are cold, teeny tiny grains of dust and water ice &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.7132.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;can stick together in funny shapes&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;em&gt;fractals&lt;/em&gt;. These are branching structures that aren't regularly spaced like crystals; instead they have a structure that's called self-similar: It looks the same no matter how much you zoom in or out. I know that sounds weird, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFtTdf3I6Ug&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this video will help&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-container media-container--view-mode--syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-container--type--video&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;media-youtube-video media-element file-syfy-wire-blog-video-full-size media-youtube-2&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;media-youtube-player&quot; id=&quot;media-youtube-wfttdf3i6ug&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; title=&quot;What Is A Fractal (and what are they good for)?&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFtTdf3I6Ug?wmode=opaque&amp;amp;controls=&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;amp;playerapiid=media-youtube-wfttdf3i6ug&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;Video of What Is A Fractal (and what are they good for)?&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this a lot in nature, including in snowflakes. Materials made in a fractal pattern can be very porous, and in fact out in that protoplanetary disk around a young star, physical models show that objects can grow fractally until they're as big as ‘Oumuamua, and have those extremely low densities needed to account for its weird behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 'Oumuamua doesn't have to be a spaceship. It just has to be a snowflake! A three-dimensionally constructed phenomenally porous low-density snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact this actually makes sense. The fact we see something like 'Oumuamua coming from interstellar space means we can try to estimate how many of them are out there at any time. Making some simple assumptions, the numbers you get &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02148.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;are way too high&lt;/a&gt; to be explained by having the galaxy filled with such beasts. It seems far more likely that objects like 'Oumuamua are relatively rare, and that means it likely came from someplace close by (if it came from farther away, the odds are even lower we'd ever see one). Working out the math, the new paper suggests it came from a nearby star, and one that's relatively young (less than 100 million years). It formed out in the disk, and got ejected somehow, likely from a planet forming nearby giving it a boost from its gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I love this. It may not be as sexy or headline-grabbing as saying it's an alien probe, but it's very clever, it uses known materials and math, and the conclusion even fits in with what we know about how planets form. That makes it pretty dang cool in its own right. If I had to bet, I'd put a lot more money on this idea being correct over 'Oumuamua being an artifact from another civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be we'll never know; it's moving pretty rapidly relative to us, and is very far away now — it's currently over 1.6 billion kilometers away. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=%27Oumuamua;old=0;orb=1;cov=0;log=0;cad=0#orb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;In a year&lt;/a&gt; it'll be 900 million km further. So it's not like we can catch up to it anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll just have to wait for another such object … which, according to this new idea, may take a long time. But we're scanning the skies with better tech, seeing deeper, seeing fainter objects, all the time now. I certainly hope we find more beasties like this one. They can tell us so much about how planets form in other star systems, which is pretty hard to figure out from dozens or hundreds of light years away. It's a lot easier when they obligingly send bits of their building materials to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Pollock, the founder of the tech how-to book publisher No Starch Press, called out Amazon on February 13 for selling what he says are counterfeit copies of his company's book, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Assembly Language&lt;/em&gt;—copies that Amazon apparently printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Just discovered today a new case of copyright infringement directly by AMAZON'S CREATESPACE. Not the first time! This is obviously NOT printed by No Starch. Kindly report any other cases to us. Please RT and share. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@amazon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nostarch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@nostarch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ayjebwTiOI&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ayjebwTiOI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Pollock's post on Twitter on Wednesday, other people posted pictures of other No Starch books that had been counterfeited through Amazon, including books that had pages poorly cut. What's even crazier is that this isn't the first time this has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Pollock got reports of Amazon selling counterfeit copies of &lt;em&gt;Python for Kids&lt;/em&gt;, a popular children's introduction to programming, and four other No Starch titles. The books were easy to distinguish from No Starch's production runs because of the poorer quality of the paper and binding, changes likely resulting from Amazon's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/b/ref=pod3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=9534081031&quot;&gt;print-on-demand production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Images of counterfeit copies of Python for Kids being sold on Amazon. Legit copies are thicker, color, layflat binding, nicer paper. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@amazon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/P1tRBnKcvc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/P1tRBnKcvc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Bill Pollock (@billpollock) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/billpollock/status/844030960333152256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 21, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon markets the service to publishers as a way to have &quot;100 percent availability of books&quot; internationally, and the company has enrolled a number of publishers. The  service is part of Amazon's CreateSpace offering, which allows content creators to self-publish both electronically (through Kindle) and in print. Authors and publishers are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201140760&amp;amp;linkId=63130233&quot;&gt;forced to police Amazon's marketplace themselves for counterfeit books&lt;/a&gt;—and the same is true of other products sold through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that Amazon apparently doesn't police whether book content uploaded to CreateSpace actually belongs to the person doing the uploading. As others who sell through Amazon have discovered, Amazon has had a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/be-careful-amazon-com-directly-selling-counterfeits-of-our-products/349116&quot;&gt;mixing legitimate and counterfeit products in fulfillment warehouses&lt;/a&gt; because of how it prepositions product for Prime Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Amazon launched an effort &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-counterfeit-idUSKBN16S2EU&quot;&gt;to crack down on counterfeit goods sold through Amazon's Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; using a brand registry, but book pirating through CreateSpace has continued unabated. Such pirated titles are being sold directly by Amazon, not through third-party Marketplace sellers. Earlier this month, Amazon executives admitted in the company's earnings report that the company has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1542839/amazon-has-finally-admitted-to-investors-that-it-has-a-counterfeit-problem/&quot;&gt;huge counterfeiting problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, individuals have simply copied the text from other books directly and sold them through Amazon as their own works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jlendino?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jlendino&lt;/a&gt; can you explain what is happening here? The Steve S. Thomas book has the exact same text as yours throughout, the only thing changed is the author name. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/o7sY6cI33o&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/o7sY6cI33o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Kevin Savetz (@KevinSavetz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KevinSavetz/status/984539495268696065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon wouldn't comment on specifics in a statement provided to Ars. &quot;Amazon employs a variety of tools, including automated and manual reviews, to protect against abuse,&quot; Amazon PR said. &quot;When we determine that any of these types of fraud have occurred, we take action to stop the activity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
