&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;[What you need to know to start the day:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/newyorktoday?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;Get New York Today in your inbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0&quot;&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;ALBANY — New York State lawmakers have agreed to impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, changing a way of life for millions of New Yorkers as legislators seek to curb an unsightly and omnipresent source of litter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plan, proposed a year ago by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, would be the second statewide ban, after California, which banned bags &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/plastics/carryoutbags&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;New York’s ban, which would begin next March, would forbid stores to provide customers with single-use plastic bags, which are nonbiodegradable and have been blamed for everything from causing &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/dead-sperm-whale-filled-with-plastic-trash-indonesia/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gruesome wildlife deaths&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-plastic-bag-ban-recycling-0731-biz-20150730-story.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thwarting recycling efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ban, which is expected to be part of &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/nyregion/budget-new-york-congestion-pricing.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the state’s budget bills that are slated to be passed by Monday&lt;/a&gt;, would have a number of carveouts, including food takeout bags used by restaurants, bags used to wrap deli or meat counter products and bags for bulk items. Newspaper bags would also be exempted, as would garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The plan would have an additional element allowing counties to opt in to a 5-cent fee on paper bags, revenue that would go to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund as well as a separate fund to buy reusable bags for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In a statement released late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo said that “these bags have blighted our environment and clogged our waterways,” adding that the plan agreed to in Albany would be a way to “protect our natural resources for future generations of New Yorkers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Supporters said that such a two-pronged approach — paper and plastic — was necessary not only to limit the flow of litter into the state’s streets, streams and oceanfront, but also to minimize the greenhouse emissions caused by their production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“There was a real understanding that there should be a ban on plastic,” said Todd Kaminsky, a Democratic state senator from Nassau County, who is the chairman of the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/todd-kaminsky&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;environmental conservation committee&lt;/a&gt;. “And that if people go to paper rather than reusables, we are not that better off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The news of the agreement between Mr. Cuomo and his legislative counterparts comes less than a year after a similar effort stalled as a result of opposition from Republicans, who led the Senate, and from a rogue Democratic senator, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who collaborated with the Republicans. That political dynamic changed in November, when Democrats won eight seats in the Senate, sweeping themselves back into the majority and rendering Mr. Felder’s opinion moot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The ban also marks an evolution for Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, who in 2017 signed a bill that effectively &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/nyregion/cuomo-blocks-new-york-city-plastic-bag-law.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;killed a New York City law&lt;/a&gt; that would have imposed a 5-cent fee on plastic bags. The New York City fee had also been opposed by some in the State Assembly, which has been dominated by Democrats, who worried that the fee would act as a regressive tax on poor consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As outlined, however, the plan to allow counties to avoid fees on paper bags would seemingly address those concerns. But that provision also left some environmental advocates disappointed; they argue that by not mandating a paper-bag fee, many people will simply use paper bags instead of reusable bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Peter Iwanowicz, the executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, said the provision to make paper-bag fees optional made the proposed plan “a weak response to the scourge of disposable bags.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“New York had a chance to show real leadership and came up short,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The agreement was also being criticized by business and trade groups, including the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, which represents grocery stores, a major target of such bans and fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mike Durant, the group’s president, said the proposed law would “have a drastic impact on retailers,” and predicted confusion because of the opt-in provision. Mr. Durant also criticized the allocation of paper-bag fee revenue to the environmental and bag funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The failure to give even a portion of the 5-cent fee back to the stores, makes this an untenable mandate for many of our members who operate within finite profit margins,” said Mr. Durant. He added, “We are disappointed that the Legislature did not consider this alternative and failed to hear the concerns of the business community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Small business groups also expressed concern. “Every mandated cost increase adds up,” said Greg Biryla, the New York director of National Federation of Independent Business. “Independent businesses are simply not able to absorb and adjust to new mandated costs the same as their big-box competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Though such laws have been &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/litigation&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the subject of lawsuits in the past&lt;/a&gt;, several cities and other localities have imposed fees on single-use carryout bags, including Suffolk County, where such a plan led to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newsday.com/business/suffolk-nickel-plastic-bag-fee-reusable-1.24755898&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a sharp reduction&lt;/a&gt; in their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Such a disincentive is also the goal of the state plan, said Mr. Kaminsky, whose hometown, Long Beach, N.Y., has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.longbeachny.gov/?SEC=CDED59DF-3AFA-4D0B-A23D-389A7FB9C74A&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;such a program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I think we’ll look back in a few years,” he said. “And people will wonder why we didn’t do this sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>PHP 8 to Add a JIT</title>

<description>&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J8vC0LD1Qyg/XJ6Glq_WqKI/AAAAAAAAAtU/MxXUnnDhtDkLGzXtcPYAu0u16DQ2CGpSwCLcBGAs/s1600/detroit-jit.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;717&quot; data-original-width=&quot;851&quot; height=&quot;269&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J8vC0LD1Qyg/XJ6Glq_WqKI/AAAAAAAAAtU/MxXUnnDhtDkLGzXtcPYAu0u16DQ2CGpSwCLcBGAs/s320/detroit-jit.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Fig 1. A chap performing the Detroit JIT&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
Unless you have been living under a rock, or are from the past (in which case, welcome), you will be aware that a JIT is coming to PHP 8: The vote ended, quietly, today, with a vast majority in favour of merging into PHP 8, so, it's official.&lt;p&gt;Throw some crazy shapes in celebration, suggestion given in Fig 1, and it's even called &quot;The (Detroit) JIT&quot; ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now sit down and read the following myth busting article, we're going to clear up some confusion around what the JIT is, what it will benefit, and delve into how it works (but only a little, because I don't want you to be bored).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I don't know who I'm talking to, I'm going to start at the beginning with the simple questions and work up to the complex ones, if you already are sure you know the answer to the question in a heading, you can skip that part ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is JIT ?&lt;/h3&gt;
PHP implements a virtual machine, a kind of virtual processor - we call it Zend VM. PHP compiles your human readable script into instructions that the virtual machine understands (we call them opcodes), this stage of execution is what we refer to as &quot;Compile Time&quot;. At the &quot;Runtime&quot; stage of execution the virtual machine (Zend VM) executes your code's instructions (opcodes).&lt;p&gt;This all works very well, and tools like APC (in the past) and OPCache (today) cache your code's instructions (opcodes) so that &quot;Compile Time&quot; only happens when it must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, one line to explain what JIT is in general: Just-in-time is a compiler strategy that takes an intermediate representation of code and turns it into architecture dependent machine code at runtime - just-in-time for execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PHP, this means that the JIT treats the instructions generated for the Zend VM as the intermediate representation and emits architecture dependent machine code, so that the host of your code is no longer the Zend VM, but your CPU directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why does PHP need a JIT ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The focus of the PHP internals community since slightly before PHP 7.0 has been performance, brought about by healthy competition from Facebook's HHVM project. The majority of the core changes in PHP 7.0 were contained in the PHPNG patch, which improved significantly the way in which PHP utilizes memory and CPU at its core, since then every one of us has been forced to keep one eye on performance.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Since PHP 7.0 some performance improvements have been made, optimizations for the HashTable (a core data structure for PHP), specializations in the Zend VM for certain opcodes, specializations in the compiler for certain sequences, and a constant stream of improvements to the Optimizer component of OPCache ... and many others besides, too boring to list.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It's a brute fact that these optimizations can only take us so far and we are rapidly approaching, or maybe have already met, a brick wall in our ability to improve it any further.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Caveat: When we say things like &quot;we can't improve it any further&quot;, what we really mean is, &quot;the trade-offs we would have to make to improve it any further no longer look appealing&quot; ... whenever we talk about performance optimizations, we're talking about trade-offs. Often, trade-offs in simplicity for performance. We would all like to think that the simplest code is the fastest code, but that simply is not the case in the modern world of C programming. The fastest code is often that code which is prepared to take advantage of architecture dependent intrinsics or platform (compiler) dependent builtins. Simplicity just is not a guarantee of the best performance ...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;At this time, the ability for PHP to JIT would appear to be the best way to squeeze more performance from PHP.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will the JIT make my website faster ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In all probability, not significantly.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Maybe not the answer you were expecting: In the general case, applications written in PHP are I/O bound, and JIT works best on CPU bound code.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What on earth does &quot;I/O and CPU bound&quot; mean ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When we want to describe the general performance characteristics of a piece of code, or an application, we use the terms I/O bound and CPU bound.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In the simplest possible terms:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An I/O bound piece of code would go faster if we could improve (reduce, optimize) the I/O it is doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CPU bound piece of code would go faster if we could improve (reduce, optimize) the instructions the CPU is executing - or (magically) increase the clock speed of the CPU :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;A piece of code, or an application, may be I/O bound, CPU bound, or bound equally to CPU and I/O.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In general, PHP applications tend to be I/O bound - the thing that is slowing them down is the I/O which they are performing - connecting, reading, and writing to databases, caches, files, sockets and so on.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does CPU bound PHP look like ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;CPU bound code is not something a lot of PHP programmers will be familiar with, because of the nature of most PHP applications - their job tends to be connect to some database, and or possibly a cache, do some light lifting and spit out an html/json/xml response.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;You may look around your codebase and find lots of code that has nothing whatever to do with I/O, code that is calling functions completely disconnected from I/O even, and be confused that I seem to be implying that this doesn't make your application CPU bound, even though there may be many more lines of code that deal with non I/O than I/O.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;PHP is actually quite fast, it's one of the fastest interpreted languages in the world. There is no remarkable difference between the Zend VM calling a function that has nothing to do with I/O, and making the same call in machine code. There is clearly &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; difference, but the fact is that machine code has a calling convention, and Zend VM has a calling convention, machine code has a prologue and Zend VM has a prologue: Whether you call some_c_level_function() in Zend Opcodes or machine code doesn't make a significant difference to the performance of the application making the call - although it may seem to make a significant difference to that call.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: A calling convention is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(roughly)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; a sequence of instructions executed *before* entering into another function, a prologue is a sequence of instructions executed *at entry* into another function: The calling convention in both cases pushes arguments onto the stack, and the prologue pops them off the stack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;What about loops, and tail calls and X I hear you ask: PHP is actually quite smart, with the Optimizer component of OPCache enabled your code is transformed as if by magic into the most efficient form you could have written.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It's important to note now that JIT doesn't change the calling convention of Zend Functions from the convention established by the VM - Zend must be able to switch between JIT and VM modes at any time and so the decision was taken to retain the calling convention established by the VM. As a result those calls that you see everywhere aren't remarkably faster when JIT'd.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;If you want to see what CPU bound PHP code looks like, look in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/bench.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zend/bench.php&lt;/a&gt; ... This is obviously an extreme example of CPU bound code, but it should drive home the point that where the JIT really shines is in the area of mathematics.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Did PHP make the ultimate trade-off to make math faster ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;No. We did it to widen the scope of PHP, and considerably so. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Without wanting to toot our own horn, we have the web covered - If you are a web programmer in 2019 and you haven't considered using PHP for your next project, then you are doing the web wrong - in this very biased PHP developer's opinion.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;To improve the ability to execute math faster in PHP seems, at a glance, to be a very narrow scope. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;However, this in fact opens the door on things such as machine learning, 3d rendering, 2d (gui) rendering, and data analysis, to name just a few.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why can't we have this in PHP 7.4 ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I just called the JIT &quot;the ultimate trade-off&quot;, and I think it is: It's arguably one of the most complex compiler strategies ever invented, maybe the most complex. To introduce a JIT is to introduce considerable complexity.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;If you ask Dmitry (the author of the JIT) if he made PHP complex, he would say &quot;No, I hate complexity&quot; (that's a direct quote).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;At bottom, complex is &lt;em&gt;anything we do not understand&lt;/em&gt;, and at the moment, there are very few internals developers (less than a handful) that truly understand the implementation of JIT that we have.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;PHP 7.4 is coming up fast, merging into PHP 7.4 would leave us with a version of PHP that less than a handful of people could debug, fix, or improve (in any real sense). This is just not an acceptable situation for those people that voted no on merging into PHP 7.4.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In the time between now and PHP 8, many of us will be working in our spare time to understand the JIT: We still have features we want to implement and tools we need to rewrite for PHP 8, and first we must understand the JIT. We need this time, and are very grateful that a majority of voters saw fit to give it to us.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Complex is not synonymous with horrible: Complex can be beautiful, like a nebula, and the JIT is that kind of complex. You can, in principle, fully understand something complex and only make a marginal reduction in the apparent complexity of that thing. In other words, even when there are 20 internals developers who are as familiar with the JIT as Dmitry is, it doesn't really change the complex nature of JIT.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will development of PHP slow down ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There's no reason to think that it will. We have enough time that we can say with confidence that by the time PHP 8 is generally available, there will be enough of us familiar with the JIT to function at least as well as we do today when it comes to fixing bugs and pushing PHP forward.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;When trying to square this with the view that a JIT is inherently complex, consider that the majority of our time spent on introducing new features is actually spent discussing that feature. For the majority of features, and even fixes, code may take in the order of minutes or hours to write, and discussions take in the order of weeks or months. In rare cases, the code for a feature may take in the order of hours or days to write, but the discussion will always take longer in those rare cases.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;That's all I have to say about that ... &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Enjoy your weekend.&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Intel VISA Exploit Gives Access to Computer’s Entire Data, Researchers Show</title>
<link>https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/intel-visa-sa-00086-exploit-researchers-computer-data-access-2014854</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/intel-visa-sa-00086-exploit-researchers-computer-data-access-2014854</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have discovered a previously unknown feature in the Intel chipsets, which could allow an attacker to intercept data from the computer memory. The feature called Intel Visualization of Internal Signals Architecture (Intel VISA) is said to be a utility that is bundled by the chipmaker for testing on the manufacturing lines. Although Intel doesn't publicly disclose the existence of Intel VISA and is extremely secretive about it, the researchers were able to find several ways to enable the feature on the Intel chipsets and capture the data from the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a per presentation made by the researchers Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy of Positive Technologies at the ongoing Blackhat Asia 2019 conference in Singapore, their exploits of the Intel chipsets don't require any hardware modifications or special equipment. One of the techniques shared by the researchers involved vulnerabilities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; in Intel-SA-00086 advisory that give access to Intel Management Engine (Intel ME), in turn helping enable VISA. Access to Intel VISA makes the computer's entire data vulnerable and obtainable for the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel underplayed the exploit and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/researchers-discover-and-abuse-new-undocumented-feature-in-intel-chipsets/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; ZDNet that the VISA issue requires physical access to the machines and the Intel-SA-00086 vulnerabilities have already been mitigated. The researchers however disagreed with Intel's comments and reportedly said in an online discussion that the patched Intel firmware can be downgraded using Intel ME, making the chipset vulnerable and opening the door for accessing Intel VISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Ermolov also noted that the vulnerabilities detailed in Intel-SA-00086 are just one of the ways to access VISA, and there are other methods as well, including Orange Mystery and Intel JTAG password. The technical details of these exploits can be found in the presentation slides &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.blackhat.com/asia-19/Thu-March-28/bh-asia-Goryachy-Ermolov-Intel-Visa-Through-the-Rabbit-Hole.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; on Blackhat Asia website.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On Being a Free Software Maintainer</title>
<link>https://feaneron.com/2019/03/28/on-being-a-free-software-maintainer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://feaneron.com/2019/03/28/on-being-a-free-software-maintainer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Year is 2013. I learn about a new, alpha-quality project called “GNOME Calendar.” Intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cool, I’ll track that,” said my younger self. Heavy development was happening at the &lt;em&gt;ui-rework&lt;/em&gt; branch. Every day, a few new commits. Pull, build, test. Except one day, no new commits. Nor the next day. Or week. Or month. Or year. I’m disappointed. Didn’t want that project to die. You know…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nope. Not gonna happen,” also said my younger self. Clone, build, fix bugs, send patches. Maintainer’s interest in the project is renewed. We get a new icon, things get serious. We go to a new IRC room (!) and make the first public release of GNOME Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year passes, it is now 2015. After contributing for more than a year, Erick made me the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; GNOME Calendar maintainer ¹. A mix of positive emotions flows: proud of the achievement; excitement for being able to carry on with my ideas for the future of the application; fear, for the weight of the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But heck, I am a free software maintainer now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was 4 years ago. Time passes, things happen, experience is built. Experience that differs from what I originally expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a free software maintainer is a funny place to find yourself in. Good things came from it. Bad things too. Also terrible. And weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, there is a strong sense of achievement when you, well, achieve maintainership of a project. Usually, getting there requires a large number of interactions during a long period of time. It means you are trusted. It means you are trustworthy. It means you are skilled enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also usually means stronger community bonds. Getting to know excellent people, that know a lot and are willing to share and mentor and help, is a life-changing experience. There is a huge human value in being surrounded by great people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who enjoy coding, hooray! Full plate. Planning releases, coding and doing reviews can be fun too. You will fix problems, find solutions, think and design your code. There is a plethora of problems to fix in this plane of existence, and you have the chance to independently fix a few of them by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people. There are good people in this planet. You eventually will receive a thank you email, or you will be paid a coffee. One way or another, people find their way to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People really do find their way to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, sometimes the software you maintain, well, it crashes. It may lose someone’s data. Someone may trigger a unique condition inside the code that you never managed to do. These people may get angry, sad, and frustrated ².&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; find their way to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be demanded to fix your software. You will be shouted. Sometimes, the line may be crossed, and you will be abused. “How dare you not (&lt;em&gt;use your free time to&lt;/em&gt;) fix this ultra high priority bug that is affecting me?” or “This is an absolutely basic feature! How is it not implemented yet (&lt;em&gt;by you on your free time&lt;/em&gt;)?!” or even “You made me move to Software Y, and you need to win me back” are going to be realities you will have to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may get emotional about your code. You may feel ashamed of what you did, and do. After all, your code has bugs, there are numerous issues opened at your bug tracker, and people are complaining non-stop. (Oh and, naturally, there will be someone who will try their best to put you down with that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, you will look at your issue backlog and feel a subtle despair when realise you won’t ever be able to fix all the bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are open to review other people’s contributions, there is a high change you will find challengers disguised as contributors. And your code review will be treated as an intellectual battle between good and evil. And you will need to explain and clarify over and over, and deal with circular logic, and pretty much any tool people might use to win battles instead of improving their code. And that is incredibly tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be told that &lt;em&gt;you need to develop a thick skin&lt;/em&gt;. To ignore that, let it go, think positive and don’t pay attention to all the shit that is being thrown at you and why are you so goddamn negative you’re a maintainer for christ sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not feel the joy of working on what you work anymore. You may want to move on. You may also not do that due to the sense of responsibility that you have to your code, your community, and the people who use your software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, being a free software maintainer may have a high price to your psychological and emotional health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I certainly did not know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;has-small-font-size&quot;&gt;¹ – And by “maintainer”, I am talking about being an upstream code maintainer, not package maintainer.&lt;br/&gt;² – Rightfully so. Nobody wants to lose their stuff, or have their workflow broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wpcnt&quot;&gt;

<title>Bezos Investigation Says the Saudis Obtained His Private Data</title>
<link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-investigation-finds-the-saudis-obtained-his-private-information</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For 40 years, I’ve advised at-risk public figures and government agencies on high-stakes security matters. My career has included working with the CIA, FBI, at the Reagan White House, counseling foreign leaders, and advising on controversial murder cases. I’ve seen a lot. And yet, I’ve recently seen things that have surprised even me, such as the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; parent company, AMI, being in league with a foreign nation that’s been actively trying to harm American citizens and companies, including the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. You know him as Jeff Bezos; I know him as my client of 22 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand where this story goes, some background is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; published a special edition that revealed an intimate relationship Bezos was having. He asked me to learn who provided his private texts to the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, and why. My office quickly identified the person whom the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; had paid as a source: a man named &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7&quot;&gt;Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, the now-estranged brother of Lauren Sanchez, whom Bezos was dating. What was unusual, very unusual, was how hard AMI people worked to publicly reveal their source’s identity. First through strong hints they gave to me, and later through direct statements, AMI practically pinned a “kick me” sign on Michael Sanchez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was not the White House, it was not Saudi Arabia,” a company lawyer said on national television, before telling us more: “It was a person that was known to both Bezos and Ms. Sanchez.” In case even more was needed, he added, “Any investigator that was going to investigate this knew who the source was,” a very helpful hint since the name of who was being investigated had been made public 10 days earlier in a &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe&quot;&gt;Daily Beast report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much was made about a recent front-page story in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, fingering Michael Sanchez as the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; source—but that information was first published almost seven weeks ago by The Daily Beast, after “multiple sources inside AMI” told The Daily Beast the exact same thing. The actual news in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; article was that its reporters were able to confirm a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/brother-of-jeff-bezos-girlfriend-admits-a-deal-with-national-enquirer&quot;&gt;claim Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; had been making: It was &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-national-enquirer-got-bezos-texts-it-paid-200-000-to-his-lovers-brother-11552953981&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; who first contacted Michael Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; about the affair, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMI has repeatedly &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/business/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-amazon-hollywood.html&quot;&gt;insisted they had only one source&lt;/a&gt; on their Bezos story, but the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; began conversations with Michael Sanchez, they had “already been investigating whether Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez were having an affair.” Michael Sanchez has since confirmed to Page Six that when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; contacted him back in July, they had already “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pagesix.com/2019/03/30/this-was-real-lauren-sanchezs-brother-tells-all-on-bezos-romance/?_ga=2.164107583.1694089182.1553909345-326982824.1534253864&quot;&gt;seen text exchanges&lt;/a&gt;” between the couple. If accurate, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and Page Six stories would mean, clearly and obviously, that &lt;em&gt;the initial information came from other channels—another source or method.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[On Sunday, AMI issued a statement insisting that “it was Michael Sanchez who tipped the National Enquirer off to the affair on Sept. 10, 2018, and over the course of four months provided all of the materials for our investigation.” &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/national-enquirer-says-saudis-didnt-help-on-bezos-story&quot;&gt;Read the full statement here&lt;/a&gt;. -- ed.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bezos directed me to ‘spend whatever is needed’ to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it. That investigation is now complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is complicated, and can’t always be boiled down to a simple narrative like “the brother did it,” even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid, and even when that brother is an associate of Roger Stone and Carter Page. Though interesting, it turns out those truths are also too simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did AMI’s people work so hard to identify a source, and insist to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and others that he was their sole source for everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best answer is contained in what happened next: AMI threatened to publish embarrassing photos of Jeff Bezos unless certain conditions were met. (These were photos that, for some reason, they had held back and not published in their first story on the Bezos affair, or any subsequent story.) While a brief summary of those terms has been made public before, others that I’m sharing are new—and they reveal a great deal about what was motivating AMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An eight-page contract AMI sent for me and Bezos to sign would have required that I make a public statement, composed by them and then widely disseminated, saying that my investigation had concluded they hadn’t relied upon “any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their news-gathering process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note here that I’d never publicly said anything about electronic eavesdropping or hacking—and they wanted to be sure I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also wanted me to say our investigation had concluded that their Bezos story was not “instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise.” External forces? Such a strange phrase. AMI knew these statements did not reflect my conclusions, because I told AMI’s Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard (in a 90-minute recorded phone call) that what they were asking me to say about external forces and hacking “is not my truth,” and would be “just echoing what you are looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Indeed, an earlier set of their proposed terms included AMI making a statement “affirming that it undertook no electronic eavesdropping in connection with its reporting and has no knowledge of such conduct”—but now they wanted me to say that for them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract further held that if Bezos or I were ever in our lives to “state, suggest or allude to” anything contrary to what AMI wanted said about electronic eavesdropping and hacking, then they could publish the embarrassing photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this today because it’s exactly what the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; scheme was intended to prevent me from doing. Their contract also contained terms that would have inhibited both me and Bezos from initiating a report to law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things didn’t work out as they hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the terms for avoiding publication of personal photos were presented to Jeff Bezos, he responded immediately: “No thank you.” Within hours, he wrote an essay describing his reasons for rejecting AMI’s threatening proposal. Then he &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f&quot;&gt;posted it all on Medium&lt;/a&gt;, including AMI’s actual emails and their salacious descriptions of private photos. (After the Medium post, AMI put out a limp statement saying it “believed fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues Bezos raised in his Medium post have nothing whatsoever to do with Michael Sanchez, any more than revealing the name of a low-level Watergate burglar sheds light on the architects of the Watergate cover-up. Bezos was not expressing concerns about the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; original story; he was focused on what he called “extortion and blackmail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Bezos directed me to “spend whatever is needed” to learn who may have been complicit in the scheme, and why they did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investigation is now complete. As has been reported elsewhere, my results have been turned over to federal officials. Since it is now out of my hands, I intend today’s writing to be my last public statement on the matter. Further, to respect officials pursuing this case, I won’t disclose details from our investigation. I am, however, comfortable confirming one key fact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information. As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote__quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not reach our conclusions lightly. The inquiry included a broad array of resources: investigative interviews with current and former AMI executives and sources, extensive discussions with top Middle East experts in the intelligence community, leading cybersecurity experts who have tracked Saudi spyware, discussions with current and former advisers to President Trump, Saudi whistleblowers, people who personally know the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), people who work with his close associate Saud al-Qahtani, Saudi dissidents, and other targets of Saudi action, including writer/activist &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.arabtyrantmanual.com/&quot;&gt;Iyad el-Baghdadi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts with whom we consulted confirmed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports on the Saudi capability to “collect vast amounts of previously inaccessible data from smartphones in the air without leaving a trace—including phone calls, texts, emails”—and confirmed that hacking was a key part of the Saudis’ “&lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/government-hackers-nso-darkmatter.html&quot;&gt;extensive surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately led to the killing of [&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;] journalist Jamal Khashoggi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Americans will be surprised to learn that the Saudi government has been intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudi campaign against Bezos has already been reported by &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business&quot;&gt;CNN International&lt;/a&gt;, Bloomberg, &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-saudis-made-jeff-bezos-public-enemy-1&quot;&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/a&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia attacks people in many ways, obviously, including through their &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;elaborate social media program&lt;/a&gt; that uses sophisticated technology and paid surrogates to create artificially trending hashtags. To give you an idea of how this program has infected the U.S., the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that the Saudis &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-twitter.html&quot;&gt;even had an operative inside Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which fired the suspect employee, and later advised select activists and others that “your Twitter account is one of a small group of accounts that may have been targeted by state-sponsored actors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the Saudi government &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2019/02/12/jeff-bezos-washington-post-saudi-ami.cnn-business/video/playlists/business-jeff-bezos/&quot;&gt;unleashed its cyberarmy&lt;/a&gt; on Bezos (and later me). Their multi-pronged campaign included public calls for boycotts against Amazon.com and its Saudi subsidiary, Souq.com. Just three examples among thousands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Mobiledoc&quot; readability=&quot;17.196610169492&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We as Saudis will never accept to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aadelljaber/status/1059178591567728640&quot;&gt;attacked by the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, only to buy products from Amazon and Souq.com by night! Strange that all three companies are owned by the same Jew who attacks us by day, and sells us products by night!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our weapon is to boycott… because the owner of the newspaper is the same as their owner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yhya_jaber/status/1065352725750259712&quot;&gt;We're after you - the Jew&lt;/a&gt;, worshipper of money, will go bankrupt by the will of God at the hands of Saudi Arabia... the owner of Amazon and Souq is the owner of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is the spiteful Jew who insults us every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bezos is not Jewish, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied the well-documented and close relationship between MBS and AMI chairman, David Pecker. That alliance includes David Pecker &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/media/david-pecker-trump-saudi-arabia.html&quot;&gt;bringing MBS intermediary&lt;/a&gt; Kacy Grine to a private White House meeting with President Trump and Jared Kushner. Pecker has also traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with the Crown Prince. Though we don’t know what was discussed in those private meetings, AMI’s actions afterwards are telling. To coincide with MBS’ March 2018 U.S. tour, AMI created a 100-page, ad-free, glossy magazine called &lt;a class=&quot;TrackingLink LinkWrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-publisher-pal-puts-saudi-propaganda-magazine-in-us-supermarkets&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since MBS wasn’t yet a notorious figure in the West (this was before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi), AMI’s magazine introduced him to Americans as “the most influential Arab leader—transforming the world at 32,” and “improving lives of his people &amp;amp; hopes for peace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press reported that AMI sent &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;an advance digital copy&lt;/a&gt; of their laudatory magazine to the Saudi Embassy three weeks before printing and distributing 200,000 issues. (Despite AP’s substantial forensic evidence, the kingdom denied it received the magazine’s content in advance. While we’re on denials, the kingdom says Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with the Bezos matter. The kingdom also says MBS had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When AMI publicly insisted that nobody outside of their executives and editors “had any influence on this publication or its content,” I guess they meant other than Kacy Grine, the very same MBS intermediary Pecker had brought to The White House. I say that because AMI soon had to disclose to the Department of Justice National Security Division that their mystery magazine included content written by Grine, and that they also gave him the whole working draft for advance review, and that he suggested changes, and that they implemented his changes, and that he provided better photographs of MBS. With friends like AMI, you don’t need… publicists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My firm has done many investigations into &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; misconduct, including one that became the subject of a &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-29/entertainment/ca-1145_1_national-enquirer&quot;&gt;investigative piece&lt;/a&gt; way back in 1990. Before then, tabloids had been seen as almost funny publications, mixing celebrity gossip with space aliens and Elvis sightings. But when the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer’s&lt;/em&gt; on-again-off-again relationship with the truth percolated into politics, it wasn’t so funny anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though relatively benign at first (“Al Gore’s Diet Is Making Him Stupid”), the Trump/Pecker relationship has metastasized: In effect, the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/media/national-enquirer-trump-mistresses.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; became an enforcement arm&lt;/a&gt; of the Trump presidential campaign, and presidency, as the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York laid out in its case against Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty. The U.S. Attorney has done the country a service by levying extensive controls on AMI, David Pecker, and his deputy Dylan Howard, through a &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1119501/download&quot;&gt;non-prosecution agreement&lt;/a&gt; that requires them to commit no other crimes for three years, and requires everyone at AMI to attend annual training on federal election laws. I’m guessing that’s not how they used to spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;Fancylinks&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be wrong to imply that the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t evolved since the ’90s, because it has. The tabloid and its chairman have evolved into &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/d293d282a9ec4d0c83fe0a25ff5f285c&quot;&gt;secretly entangling with a nation-state&lt;/a&gt; that’s using its enormous resources to harm American citizens and companies. And now they’ve evolved into trying to strong-arm an American citizen whom that country’s leadership wanted harmed, compromised, and silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Saudi side of the equation: Not only does the kingdom have a close alliance with AMI—which owns the &lt;em&gt;Enquirer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Us Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Star&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt;, Radar Online, and many other publications—but the &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/saudi-arabia-hollywood-media-deals-where-they-stand-jamal-khashoggi/&quot;&gt;Saudis have pursued investments&lt;/a&gt; and partnerships involving &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the Robb Report&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike these publications, it’s clear that MBS considers the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; to be a major enemy. Saudi Arabia is hardly the first repressive regime that seeks total control of the news media in its own country. Wanting to control the media in the United States—and using any means to do so—will hopefully prove to be an overreach.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A man targeted by marketing companies is making money from cold calls with his own higher-rate phone number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2011 Lee Beaumont paid £10 plus VAT to set up his personal 0871 line - so to call him now costs 10p, from which he receives 7p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leeds businessman told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b038xx7g&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme&lt;/a&gt; that the line had so far made £300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phone Pay Plus, which regulates premium numbers, said it strongly discouraged people from adopting the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Beaumont came up with the plan when he grew sick of calls offering to help him reclaim payment protection insurance (PPI), or install solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: &quot;I don't use my normal Leeds number for anyone but my friends and family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he had set up the 0871 line, every time a bank, gas or electricity supplier asked him for his details online, he submitted it as his contact number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Annoying calls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens Advice commissioned a survey about unwanted PPI calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in four of those who had received unwanted calls said this had interrupted family meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls remain the most common form of contact about PPI claims, followed by automated landline messages and text messages to mobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who believes that they have been mis-sold PPI can make a claim directly to their provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;He admitted the scheme had changed his attitude, saying: &quot;I want cold calls&quot;, and that he had moved on to encouraging companies to make contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a recent problem with his online shopping, he declined to call an 0845 number but posted his number on Twitter in the knowledge that the number could be picked up by marketing companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the premium number regulator Phone Pay Plus says the public should think twice before setting up their own lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say phone line providers must meet consumer protection standards, which include transparency, fairness and complaint handling, which would mean clearly setting out the cost of each call to any organisation that rang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They told You and Yours: &quot;Premium rate numbers are not designed to be used in this way and we would strongly discourage any listeners from adopting this idea, as they will be liable under our code for any breaches and subsequent fines that result.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey for charity Citizens Advice found that two-thirds of those asked had received unwanted calls, texts, emails or letters about PPI mis-selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half said that they had been contacted more than 10 times in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;author-timestamp&quot; itemprop=&quot;datePublished&quot; content=&quot;2019-03-30T11:00-500&quot;&gt;March 30 at 11:00 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;A common ailment is going around, and you probably know someone plagued by it. Caused in part by social media, the 24-hour news cycle and the pressure to check work email outside of office hours, it could hit you, too — especially if you don’t know how to nip it in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Burnout is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Books are being published about it, high-powered medical groups are raising alarms and ordinary people are feeling it. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/01/PhysicianBurnoutReport2018FINAL.pdf&quot; title=&quot;cdn1.sph.harvard.edu&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard and Massachusetts medical organizations declared physician burnout a public health crisis. It pointed out the problem not only harms doctors but also patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;“Burnout is associated with increasing medical errors,” the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Ninety-five percent of human resource leaders say burnout is sabotaging workplace retention, often because of overly heavy workloads, one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/employee-burnout-crisis-study-reveals-big-workplace-challenge-2017&quot; title=&quot;www.kronos.com&quot;&gt;survey found&lt;/a&gt;. Poor management contributes to the burnout epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;“Organizations typically reward employees who are putting in longer hours and replace workers who aren’t taking on an increased workload, which is a systematic problem that causes burnout in the first place,” says Dan Schawbel, research director of Future Workplace, the firm that conducted the survey along with Kronos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot; class=&quot;fixjump&quot;&gt;&quot;Mommy Burnout,&quot; a book published last year by psychologist Sheryl Ziegler, resonated with women who had run themselves into the ground trying to be super mom (and dads made it clear they were burned out, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;A new book, “Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle,” by sisters Emily Nagoski (a health educator) and Amelia Nagoski (a choral conductor who was hospitalized for burnout) aims to help women, in particular, live a more balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Burnout is a term easily tossed around, the way somebody might claim to be starving when they’re simply hungry, or freezing when cold. That’s harmless if a person is describing a tired day or week. But somebody who is actually burned out should be prepared to take serious action because it’s a condition that needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/how-you-can-battle-burnout/2019/03/29/a83bed70-4f47-11e9-8d28-f5149e5a2fda_story.html&quot;&gt;How you can battle burnout&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Amelia Nagoski was juggling the demands of a doctoral program when she experienced such severe abdominal pain she was hospitalized. Doctors concluded it was “just stress” and told her to relax. Turns out, she had stress-induced inflammation from burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Ziegler defines burnout as “chronic stress gone awry.” The big three symptoms are emotional exhaustion, cynicism and feeling ineffective, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nam.edu/valid-reliable-survey-instruments-measure-burnout-well-work-related-dimensions/&quot; title=&quot;nam.edu&quot;&gt;Maslach Burnout Inventory&lt;/a&gt; (MBI), a survey designed to measure employee burnout in the workforce. Other symptoms can include frequent colds or sicknesses, insomnia and a tendency to alleviate stress in unhealthy ways, such as with too much alcohol or online shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Part of the difficulty of pinpointing true burnout may be because burnout is a nonmedical term — at least in the United States. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders doesn’t list it as an illness. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5889935/&quot; title=&quot;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;&gt;other countries&lt;/a&gt; including France, Denmark and Sweden, do recognize burnout syndrome and consider it to be a legitimate reason to take a sick day from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;“Everybody intuitively recognizes what burnout feels like in their bodies and their feelings and their thoughts,” Emily Nagoski says. “It’s like art: You know it when you see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Even without an official diagnosis — or agreed upon definition — American researchers have studied burnout for decades. Psychologist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/05/nyregion/herbert-freudenberger-73-coiner-of-burnout-is-dead.html&quot; title=&quot;www.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Herbert Freudenberger&lt;/a&gt; popularized the term in the 1970s, basing it on his work with drug addicts where he witnessed their veins burn out from needle injections and their cigarettes burn down. Soon after, psychologist Christina Maslach developed the MBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Burnout is caused by chronic stress, not stressors, the Nagoskis say in their book. It’s important to differentiate the two. Stressors are external: to-do lists, financial problems or anxiety about the future. Stress, on the other hand, “is the neurological and physiological shift that happens in your body when you encounter [stressors],” the Nagoskis write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;To fix burnout, people need to address the stress itself. They must allow their body to complete its stress response cycle. Instead, people tend to focus on stressors. “They assume their stress will go away if they’re on top of things, if they’re accomplishing things and constantly checking things off their to-do list,” Emily Nagoski says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;That’s a lesson Paula Davis-Laack learned the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;Davis-Laack practiced commercial real estate law before the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The fast-paced environment gave her a constant adrenaline high as she closed deals and kept so busy that she barely left time to grab a handful of peanuts for lunch. Her frequent headaches, stomach aches and colds threatened to drag her down, but no doctor could give her a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;One day, drafting a document in her office, she says she felt like she couldn’t breathe. She bolted out of her chair and raced to a nearby health clinic. “Help me!” she gasped. She was having a panic attack. After two more medical crises landed her in the emergency room, she feared a mental or physical collapse if she kept going. She decided to walk away from the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;“It was like a 50,000-pound weight lifted off my shoulders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Still unsure of what was wrong, she poked around the Internet doing research of her own when she came across information on burnout. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is exactly what happened to me!’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Davis-Laack traces the beginning of her burnout back to her teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;“There were a lot of messages to be a high achiever,” she says. “Those check-the-box matrix measurements were important to me. I internalized them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;The messages took an even stronger hold once she started working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;She returned to graduate school to study well-being, the effects of stress and their effect on the workplace. In 2013, she opened the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pauladavislaack.com/&quot; title=&quot;www.pauladavislaack.com&quot;&gt;Davis Laack Stress &amp;amp; Resilience Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Wisconsin. She now teaches workshops on burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;For those who suspect they might be on the road to burnout, there are practical tools to mitigate it. Among others: physical exercise, sleep and positive social connection (the real kind, not the Facebook kind). The importance of balance and self-care to prevent burnout likely isn’t surprising to most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;“There’s nothing fancy about what it would take to turn things around,” says Ziegler, the “Mommy Burnout” author. “But it’s a huge shift in the cultural mind-set. That’s the challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Plus, fixing burnout can feel like adding more stressors. An employee who takes a lunch break in a park (time in nature reduces stress) might feel pressured to stay late at the end of the day. A yoga class or walk is another item to squeeze into the calendar. A mom can’t quit her parenting job. To address time-management issues, the Nagoskis provide work sheets in their book to help readers reprioritize activities. Ziegler suggests setting boundaries with social media. Use the Internet for help, such as ordering groceries, but limit scrolling to 10 minutes a day. Also, it’s okay to remove activities from the calendar (or quit them completely) so you can exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Gender might play a role in burnout, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;Researchers from the University of Montreal questioned 2,026 people, half women, in 63 different workplaces. Their work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/annweh/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/annweh/wxx114/4870017?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot; title=&quot;academic.oup.com&quot;&gt;published in the Annals of Work Exposure and Health&lt;/a&gt;, found that women reported higher levels of burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;One reason was because women have more work-and-family conflicts. The women’s rights movement was “supposed to give women choices,” Ziegler says. “Sounds awesome, but it became you need to do it all. You need to run your house and be the perfect wife and mom and work. The stress on women got higher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;Other studies have shown that rates of burnout are more or less equal among genders, although males and females experience it differently. A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-240&quot; title=&quot;bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;published in BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt; showed that female physicians are susceptible to burnout from emotional exhaustion while male physicians to burnout because of cynicism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Steven Manning remembers the night he realized he had become pessimistic about practicing medicine. One Wednesday at his family care practice in Williamston, N.C., he worked on electronic medical records well past 9 p.m. His wife and kids waited for him at home. He had seen about 30 patients that day but felt he hadn’t given a single one the highest level of care because the appointment times were too short. Yet the hospital and insurance companies kept pressuring him to see more patients a day, not fewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;“I began to think, ‘I’m burned out. How did I get to this point? I don’t enjoy coming into work.’ ” It wasn’t too late to make a change. Within a year, Manning started a direct primary care practice, a model where patients pay a membership fee, negating the need for insurance billing. Without mounds of paperwork, he had time to do what he truly wanted: help patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;“It brought back the joy of medicine I felt I was missing,” he says. “Before, I barely had time to address my patients’ diabetes, hypertension and heart failure, let alone spend time taking a mental and spiritual inventory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;Now, he talks with patients about depression, anxiety and stress and notices many patients are burned out, especially mothers of young kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;Lawyer and mom Anna Swain knows the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;She poured her heart and soul into fixing the troubled lives of criminals who had messed up with drugs and violence only to wind up devastated when her hard work seemed pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;40&quot;&gt;“I’d call my mom every day on my way home from the office crying,” she says. “I was either sad over a client who was having her third meth-addicted baby or crying over a shockingly rude email by opposing counsel.” When she added motherhood to the mix, her feelings of failure increased. “I didn’t know what I was doing. Nobody does with a first child.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Burned out on “doing the next thing I was supposed to do to be a good girl and get ahead,” she knew she needed downtime, but she was afraid to take a step back from the hamster wheel. “Boredom goes against everything we’re told to do to succeed, achieve and be proactive,” Swain says. “Even when I clean the house, I think, ‘Well, I should take the opportunity to listen to a podcast. Maybe I can grow as a person.’ Honestly, I’d grow more if I chose to be in silence and let my mind wander.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;42&quot;&gt;She tried it. Rocking her baby to sleep, she wanted to watch the TV series “Game of Thrones” or scroll through her phone. But she couldn’t. One wrong move — or the glow of a screen — would wake her baby up. At first, Swain felt angry and resentful at the lack of distractions, but the stillness gave her an opportunity to daydream. That opened the door to creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;43&quot;&gt;“I started creating little poems and rhymes in my head. I felt exhilarated,” she says. Eventually, Swain wrote a children’s book. “I felt a sense of purpose again,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;44&quot;&gt;The Nagoskis agree that daydreaming during low-demand tasks, having a creative outlet and engaging with something larger are three more keys to preventing burnout. They suggest writing your own obituary to find out what is meaningful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;45&quot;&gt;“It sounds dark,” Amelia Nagoski says. “But it makes you think about who you are and what’s important to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;46&quot;&gt;Making space in our lives so we’re not so hurried and harried isn’t easy, especially in a culture that shames slow living, Amelia Nagoski says. Preventing burnout requires hard decisions. Everyone has the same amount of time in a day: 24 hours. To rest — whether with a walk, an extra hour of sleep or a talk with a friend — means something else drops off the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;47&quot;&gt;At first, you might panic that you’re not “accomplishing” something. But before long, you may notice you’ve moved farther away from a breaking point. Your downward spiral will change directions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Boss is 90% of the &amp;#039;Employee Experience&amp;#039;</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-boss-90-employee-experience-nothing-else-comes-jim-bohn-ph-d-/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past several decades we've seen various frills added to the corporate [employee] experience: workout centers, coffee break locations on campus, better cafeterias, maybe some improved parking, and a host of on-line access to services like insurance, working-from-home, personalized learning and, in some cases, improved 401(k)s. Good stuff and a response to employees demanding more as generations and demographics change. Understood. Some of it was long overdue. Today, some might call this 'the employee experience'. And for 10% of the time we're at our jobs, it truly is the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's that other 90% that keeps nagging me. The part that simply will not change unless corporations do some dramatic work to focus on the major element in employee experience. &lt;em&gt;Your boss&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;your employee experience.&lt;/em&gt; I am not alone in this assertion. Researchers in organizational development find this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Recently wrote an article on this subject. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-experience-organizational-holy-grail-jim-bohn-ph-d-/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The employee experience]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The person you work for &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; 90% of the employee experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of four decades I worked for upwards of 30 different managers and leaders in different companies (I was a contract tech for a while so I got to see many different organizations). Some of them were outstanding, intelligent, just, insightful, creative, and easy to talk with. They had a way to improve the day, every day. They had flashes of brilliance that were utterly inspiring. They knew how to talk (and listen) to anyone, at any level in the organization. &lt;em&gt;They were my employee experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the very rough edges of a very rough childhood did not prepare me for some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand that none of my bosses were in a specific age or gender category - the demographics were all over the map. Yet each one of them was a data point in 'the employee experience'. I kept a blood pressure card while I worked for one of them. It was extremely high most days and my family gave me 20 minutes of decompression before they'd speak to me. Others were incredible mentors who were flat out brilliant. I learned from them - they listened to me - and we got a boatload of stuff done together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the primary reason you find yourself dreading going to work is your boss, you'll agree that no amount of 'employee experience' perks is going to take away that dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;u&gt;crazy&lt;/u&gt; ones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;borderline psychotic&lt;/strong&gt;, still fighting military battles long past. Loud shouting, threats of termination, snap reactions, red faces and angry voices raised were all part of that &lt;em&gt;employee experience&lt;/em&gt;. Jekyll and Hyde doesn't do some of them justice. The classic 'amygdala hijack' that we hear of in EQ was not uncommon with those leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;simply weird&lt;/strong&gt; meaning they were unpredictable, finding humor in strange things, mocking customers, criticizing quirks in other employees and exhibiting odd behavior. Of all I worked for, these made me the most uncomfortable. I never knew what they might be thinking. They were flat out creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;narcissistic&lt;/strong&gt; to the level they didn't believe anyone else mattered at all --- for anything --- and they were sometimes abusive to the extreme. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-survive-organizational-dragons-james-g-bohn-ph-d-/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How to survive organizational dragons.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some were &lt;strong&gt;drama addicts&lt;/strong&gt; who sought out the latest gossip or '&lt;em&gt;fall of the mighty&lt;/em&gt;' to drool over and wanted to discuss the drama ad infinitum, ultimately revealing their personal sense of being treated unjustly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-sized egos comes to mind when I think of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[See &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2rf90H3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;The Nuts and Bolts of Leadership&quot;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The weak ones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few who simply 'marked time'. Generally it was because they had achieved a level in an organization I doubt they ever imagined they could accomplish. Some of them simply stuck around a long time and got promoted into roles that paid well, and they didn't want to do anything to 'screw it up'. Thus they gave everyone in a department the same percentage increase and rarely spoke up about any problems their people were facing. 'Best to keep your head down', would have been their motto. Some of them had poor communication skills and leaned heavily on secretaries and admin people to keep them out of trouble. They were the ones I endured but knew I could survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The thoughtful and insightful ones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insightful and interesting role model bosses were &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. They were people who inspired me to come to work. Every day I was learning something new about a business or a tool from their experience. They saw strategy and complex issues with clarity. I was often humbled in their presence and felt the need to work harder to keep up with their example. Quite often these leaders were pleasant, had a sense of humor and yet knew how to get the job done. They knew how to listen, and they knew what to ask. Several of them are some of the smartest people I've ever met. I would love to list them in this post, but they're not the sort who would want that kind of notoriety. But they were good bosses, and I look back with pride on what we accomplished together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was an employee experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your boss holds your life in his or her hands. Your boss is your employee experience.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinating activities&lt;/em&gt; - The work that happens with others and other teams is coordinated by your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building team reputation&lt;/em&gt; - The 'good bragging' your boss does has an impact on how your team is perceived in the organization. That's a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting you choice projects&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss has heavy influence on the work you get, and the work you get builds your career and your long-term resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recognition&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss hands out recognition (or doesn't). That recognition has an influence on who you influence in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rewards&lt;/em&gt; - Your raises, your perks, your promotions and your privileges are in the hands and heart of your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coaching and performance review&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss has the honor and privilege of helping you grow and also analyzing your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adjustments to policies&lt;/em&gt; - Your boss has the ability to modify and adjust policy for travel, educational tuition assistance and other corporate benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The hard truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No amount of atmosphere is going to make up for a manager who is angry, incompetent, weak, unable to keep their word, or shrugging their shoulders and constantly saying &quot;people have to do what upper management says&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself dreading to go to work, think carefully about 'why?'. Is it the lack of a cafeteria? Perhaps the parking isn't great. Maybe there are some things about the job you simply don't like --- understood --- &lt;em&gt;but that's true in any job&lt;/em&gt;. Few of us sing like a Disney character all day while we're working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the primary reason you find yourself dreading going to work is your boss, you'll agree that no amount of 'employee experience' perks is going to take away that dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll note that I still remember these different leaders though I've not worked with many of them for decades. Experience endures in memory, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postscript&lt;/strong&gt; - I'm convinced that that majority of issues people have with corporations and organizations today stem from bad experiences with horrible bosses. Thus, organizations would be best served by applying their utmost energy to improving the skill-sets and emotional intelligence of the people who lead at any level. Find the exemplar leaders and have them teach others to improve 'the employee experience' for your entire organization. And get rid of the crazies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As always, I welcome your thoughtful insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coc is an intellisense engine for vim8 &amp;amp; neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works on &lt;code&gt;vim &amp;gt;= 8.1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;neovim &amp;gt;= 0.3.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a completion framework and language server client which supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions&quot;&gt;extension features of VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/251450/55285193-400a9000-53b9-11e9-8cff-ffe4983c5947.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/251450/55285193-400a9000-53b9-11e9-8cff-ffe4983c5947.gif&quot; alt=&quot;gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True snippet and additional text edit support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floating window requires master of neovim to work, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/F.A.Q#how-to-make-preview-window-shown-aside-with-pum&quot;&gt;follow the steps in the faq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/blob/master/doc/coc.txt&quot;&gt;doc/coc.txt&lt;/a&gt; for vim interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Completion experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why yet another completion engine since there is the already widely used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe&quot;&gt;YouCompleteMe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim&quot;&gt;deoplete.nvim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the reasons that led coc.nvim to build it's own engine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full LSP completion support&lt;/strong&gt;, especially snippet and &lt;code&gt;additionalTextEdit&lt;/code&gt; feature, you'll understand why it's awesome when you experience it with coc extension like &lt;code&gt;coc-tsserver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous and parallel completion request&lt;/strong&gt;, unless using vim sources, your vim will never blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does completion resolve on completion item change&lt;/strong&gt;. The detail from complete item is echoed after selected, this feature requires the &lt;code&gt;CompleteChanged&lt;/code&gt; autocmd to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incomplete request and cancel request support&lt;/strong&gt;, only incomplete complete request would be triggered on filter complete items and cancellation request is send to servers when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start completion without timer&lt;/strong&gt;. The completion will start after you type the first letter of a word by default and is filtered with new input after the completion has finished. Other completion engines use a timer to trigger completion so you always have to wait after the typed character.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realtime buffer keywords&lt;/strong&gt;. Coc will generate buffer keywords on buffer change in background (with debounce), while some completion engines use a cache which could be wrong sometimes. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#_locality-bonus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Locality bonus feature&lt;/a&gt; from VSCode is enabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter completion items when possible.&lt;/strong&gt; When you do a fuzzy filter with completion items, some completion engines would trigger a new completion, but coc.nvim will filter the items when possible which makes it much faster. Filtering completion items on backspace is also supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Table of contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Completion sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completion from words of buffers and file paths are supported by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other completion sources, check out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Create-custom-source&quot;&gt;create custom source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensions are powerful than configured language server. Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions&quot;&gt;Using coc extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more, to get a full list of coc extensions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Acoc.nvim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;search coc.nvim on npm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; use &lt;code&gt;:CocConfig&lt;/code&gt; to edit the configuration file, auto completion is supported after &lt;code&gt;coc-json&lt;/code&gt; has been installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example vim configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-viml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; if hidden is not set, TextEdit might fail.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Better display for messages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cmdheight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Smaller updatetime for CursorHold &amp;amp; CursorHoldI&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;updatetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;shortmess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; always show signcolumns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;signcolumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;yes

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Use tab for trigger completion with characters ahead and navigate.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Use command ':verbose imap &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;' to make sure tab is not mapped by other plugin.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;inoremap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;silent&amp;gt;&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;pumvisible&lt;/span&gt;() ? &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;C-n&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;check_back_space&lt;/span&gt;() ? &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; :
      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;coc#refresh&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;inoremap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&amp;lt;S-TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;pumvisible&lt;/span&gt;() ? &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;C-p&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;C-h&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;s:&lt;/span&gt;check_back_space&lt;/span&gt;() &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;abort&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;getline&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;col&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;~# &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;\s&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;endfunction&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Use &amp;lt;c-space&amp;gt; for trigger completion.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;inoremap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;silent&amp;gt;&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;c-space&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;coc#refresh&lt;/span&gt;()

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Use &amp;lt;cr&amp;gt; for confirm completion, `&amp;lt;C-g&amp;gt;u` means break undo chain at current position.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Coc only does snippet and additional edit on confirm.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;inoremap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;cr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;pumvisible&lt;/span&gt;() ? &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;C-y&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;C-g&amp;gt;u&lt;span class=&quot;pl-cce&quot;&gt;\&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;CR&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Use `[c` and `]c` for navigate diagnostics&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;nmap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;silent&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Plug&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(coc&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;diagnostic&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;)
