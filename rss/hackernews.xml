<title>Tech sector job interviews assess anxiety, not software skills: study</title>
<link>https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;wp-block-ncst-contact-list&quot;&gt;


&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from North Carolina State University and Microsoft finds that the technical interviews currently used in hiring for many software engineering positions test whether a job candidate has performance anxiety rather than whether the candidate is competent at coding. The interviews may also be used to exclude groups or favor specific job candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Technical interviews are feared and hated in the industry, and it turns out that these interview techniques may also be hurting the industry’s ability to find and hire skilled software engineers,” says Chris Parnin, an assistant professor of computer science at NC State and co-author of a paper on the work. “Our study suggests that a lot of well-qualified job candidates are being eliminated because they’re not used to working on a whiteboard in front of an audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical interviews in the software engineering sector generally take the form of giving a job candidate a problem to solve, then requiring the candidate to write out a solution in code on a whiteboard – explaining each step of the process to an interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisparnin.me/pdf/interviews-HN.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that many developers in the software engineering community felt the technical interview process was deeply flawed. So the researchers decided to run a study aimed at assessing the effect of the interview process on aspiring software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers conducted technical interviews of 48 computer science undergraduates and graduate students. Half of the study participants were given a conventional technical interview, with an interviewer looking on. The other half of the participants were asked to solve their problem on a whiteboard in a private room. The private interviews did not require study participants to explain their solutions aloud, and had no interviewers looking over their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured each study participant’s interview performance by assessing the accuracy and efficiency of each solution. In other words, they wanted to know whether the code they wrote would work, and the amount of computing resources needed to run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People who took the traditional interview performed half as well as people that were able to interview in private,” Parnin says. “In short, the findings suggest that companies are missing out on really good programmers because those programmers aren’t good at writing on a whiteboard and explaining their work out loud while coding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that the current format of technical interviews may also be used to exclude certain job candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For example, interviewers may give easier problems to candidates they prefer,” Parnin says. “But the format may also serve as a barrier to entire classes of candidates. For example, in our study, all of the women who took the public interview failed, while all of the women who took the private interview passed. Our study was limited, and a larger sample size would be needed to draw firm conclusions, but the idea that the very design of the interview process may effectively exclude an entire class of job candidates is troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the specific nature of the technical interview process means that many job candidates try to spend weeks or months training specifically for the technical interview, rather than for the actual job they’d be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The technical interview process gives people with industry connections an advantage,” says Mahnaz Behroozi, first author of study and a Ph.D. student at NC State. “But it gives a particularly large advantage to people who can afford to take the time to focus solely on preparing for an interview process that has very little to do with the nature of the work itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And the problems this study highlights are in addition to a suite of other problems associated with the hiring process in the tech sector, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisparnin.me/pdf/Debugging-Hiring.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;we presented at ICSE-SES&lt;/a&gt; [the International Conference on Software Engineering, Software Engineering In Society],” adds Behroozi. “If the tech sector can address all of these challenges in a meaningful way, it will make significant progress in becoming more fair and inclusive. More to the point, the sector will be drawing from a larger and more diverse talent pool, which would contribute to better work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study on technical interviews, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisparnin.me/pdf/stress_FSE_20.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Does Stress Impact Technical Interview Performance?&lt;/a&gt;,” will be presented at the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering, being held virtually from Nov. 8–13. The study was co-authored by Shivani Shirolkar, a Ph.D. student at NC State who worked on the project while an undergraduate; and by Titus Barik, a researcher at Microsoft and former Ph.D. student at NC State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Software engineering candidates commonly participate in whiteboard technical interviews as part of a hiring assessment. During these sessions, candidates write code while thinking-aloud as they work towards a solution, under the watchful eye of an interviewer. While technical interviews should allow for an unbiased and inclusive assessment of problem-solving ability, surprisingly, another possibility is that technical interviews are instead a procedure for identifying candidates who best handle and migrate stress solely caused by being examined by an interviewer (performance anxiety). To understand if coding interviews—as administered today—can induce stress that significantly hinders performance, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with 48 Computer Science students, comparing them in private and public whiteboard settings. We found that performance is reduced by more than half, by simply being watched by an interviewer. We also observed that stress and cognitive load were significantly higher in a traditional technical interview when compared with our private interview. Consequently, interviewers may be filtering out qualified candidates by confounding assessment of problem-solving ability with unnecessary stress. We propose interview modifications to make problem-solving assessment more equitable and inclusive, such as through private focus sessions and retrospective think-aloud, allowing companies to hire from a larger and diverse pool of talent.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google is facing a lawsuit for tracking people even when they opt out</title>

&lt;ul class=&quot;summary-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that Google tracks users on hundreds of thousands of apps even when they opt out of &quot;Web &amp;amp; App Activity&quot; in the settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data privacy lawsuit accuses the search engine giant of violating wiretap law and California privacy law by recording what users are looking at in apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also alleges the tracking occurs through Google's Firebase, a popular set of software for app makers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet&quot; data-analytics-module=&quot;summary_bullets&quot;&gt;Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphabet Inc's Google records what people are doing on hundreds of thousands of mobile apps even when they follow the company's recommended settings for stopping such monitoring, a lawsuit seeking class action status alleged on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data privacy lawsuit is the second filed in as many months against Google by the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner on behalf a handful of individual consumers. The firm's clients also have included Google competitors such as Facebook Inc and Oracle Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new complaint in a U.S. district court in San Jose accuses Google of violating federal wiretap law and California privacy law by logging what users are looking at in news, ride-hailing and other types of apps despite them having turned off &quot;Web &amp;amp; App Activity&quot; tracking in their Google account settings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleges the data collection happens through Google's Firebase, a set of software popular among app makers for storing data, delivering notifications and ads, and tracking glitches and clicks. Firebase typically operates inside apps invisibly to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even when consumers follow Google's own instructions and turn off 'Web &amp;amp; App Activity' tracking on their 'Privacy Controls,' Google nevertheless continues to intercept consumers' app usage and app browsing communications and personal information,&quot; the lawsuit contends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google uses some Firebase data to improve its products and personalize ads and other content for consumers, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported in March that U.S. antitrust investigators are looking into whether Google has unlawfully stifled competition in advertising and other businesses by effectively making Firebase unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In its case last month, Boies Schiller Flexner accused Google of surreptitiously recording Chrome browser users' activity even when they activated what Google calls Incognito mode. Google said it would fight the claim.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Orthodox Privilege</title>
<link>http://paulgraham.com/orth.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://paulgraham.com/orth.html</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://s.yimg.com/aah/paulgraham/orthodox-privilege-1.gif&quot; width=&quot;159&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Orthodox Privilege&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;July 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of talk about privilege lately. Although the concept is overused, there is something to it, and in particular to the idea that privilege makes you blind — that you can't see things that are visible to someone whose life is very different from yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one of the most pervasive examples of this kind of blindness is one that I haven't seen mentioned explicitly. I'm going to call it &lt;em&gt;orthodox privilege&lt;/em&gt;: The more conventional-minded someone is, the more it seems to them that it's safe for everyone to express their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's safe for them to express their opinions, because the source of their opinions is whatever it's currently acceptable to believe. So it seems to them that it must be safe for everyone. They literally can't imagine a true statement that would get them in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet at every point in history, there were true things that would get you in terrible trouble to say. Is ours the first where this isn't so? What an amazing coincidence that would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely it should at least be the default assumption that our time is not unique, and that there are true things you &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/say.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;can't say&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; now, just as there have always been. You would think. But even in the face of such overwhelming historical evidence, most people will go with their gut on this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectral signature of orthodox privilege is &quot;Why don't you just say it?&quot; If you think there's something true that people can't say, why don't you be brave, and own it? The more extreme will even accuse you of specific heresies they imagine you must have in mind, though if there's more than one heresy current in your time, these accusations will tend to be nondeterministic: you must either be an xist or a yist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrating as it is to deal with these people, it's important to realize that they're in earnest. They're not pretending they think it's impossible for an idea to be both unorthodox and true. The world really looks that way to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you respond to orthodox privilege? Merely giving it a name may help somewhat, because it will remind you, when you encounter it, why the people you're talking to seem so strangely unreasonable. Because this is a uniquely tenacious form of privilege. People can overcome the blindness induced by most forms of privilege by learning more about whatever they're not. But they can't overcome orthodox privilege just by learning more. They'd have to become more independent-minded. If that happens at all, it doesn't happen on the time scale of one conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to convince some people that orthodox privilege must exist even though they can't sense it, just as one can with, say, dark matter. There may be some who could be convinced, for example, that it's very unlikely that this is the first point in history at which there's nothing true you can't say, even if they can't imagine specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But except with these people, I don't think it will work to say &quot;check your privilege&quot; about this type of privilege, because those in its demographic don't realize they're in it. It doesn't seem to conventional-minded people that they're conventional-minded. It just seems to them that they're right. Indeed, they tend to be particularly sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the solution is to appeal to politeness. If someone says they can hear a high-pitched noise that you can't, it's only polite to take them at their word, instead of demanding evidence that's impossible to produce, or simply denying that they hear anything. Imagine how rude that would seem. Similarly, if someone says they can think of things that are true but that cannot be said, it's only polite to take them at their word, even if you can't think of any yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you realize that orthodox privilege exists, a lot of other things become clearer. For example, how can it be that a large number of reasonable, intelligent people worry about something they call &quot;cancel culture,&quot; while other reasonable, intelligent people deny that it's a problem? Once you understand the concept of orthodox privilege, it's easy to see the source of this disagreement. If you believe there's nothing true that you can't say, then anyone who gets in trouble for something they say must deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Antonio Garcia-Martinez, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Michael Nielsen , Geoff Ralston, Max Roser, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Deep Work and the 30-Hour Method for Learning a New Skill (2018)</title>
<link>https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;50.129765395894&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;45.66275659824&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry, especially the security industry, seems outrageously overwhelming to newcomers and even as an intermediate “InfoSec Pro” there seems to be an overwhelming number of paths and topics one can focus on. The problem most of us, especially newcomers, encounter is that we don’t know what to focus on. Even when we find a topic to focus on, we seem to get stuck in the vast pool of resources that are available to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the GitHub repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Hack-with-Github/Awesome-Hacking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Awesome Hacking&lt;/a&gt; (highly recommended), for example. Many people are aware of its existence. The very same people are sending me messages and asking where to start and how to not be totally overwhelmed by what seems to be a structured collection of valuable resources but doesn’t seem to solve our problem. But what exactly is our problem? It’s certainly not the lack of resources. Why is it, that although we have access to all the resources we need for developing a new skill, we fail to do so, even if we have the time or could rearrange our schedule to make time for it? Perhaps we have forgotten that the distractions we face on a daily basis prevent us from performing to the best of our abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know this feeling when we want to learn something new. We wait until motivation strikes us out of nowhere, then we tinker around for a few hours without a clear direction, checking notifications, and as soon as we realize that we’re not getting anywhere, we get discouraged and give up. Side note: if you wait for motivation, you’re doing it wrong. The formula to induce motivation, in my experience, starts with action, which sparks inspiration, which sparks motivation, which leads to action, and the loop continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know and have experienced the feeling of flow. The moment when you’re fully focused on a task. You lose all sense of time, and everything seems to flow effortlessly; you forget everything around you and have a feeling of control over the task. This rewarding feeling of flow is best described by Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that this state of flow seems so arbitrary and rare, like something that we happen to stumble upon by mere coincidence? Why don’t we strive to create a state of flow as often as possible? After all, it is not only satisfying, but also very productive and yields positive rewards. The reason we rarely reach this state is that we constantly need to remind ourselves that we live in a world full of distractions. And sometimes it is difficult to press the pause button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a state of flow, one must follow certain rules and embrace deliberate practice through a concept called deep work. In order to produce the absolute best results you’re capable of, you need to commit to deep work. The key to developing the ability for deep work is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition from a distracted state into a state of stable concentration. The rule of thumb is that it takes approximately 25 minutes of focus without distraction to reach a state of flow. If you’re checking your Twitter notifications every 20 minutes, which seems harmless, you prevent your brain from reaching that state and therefore prolong the time required to complete your task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Productivity: High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t make the mistake of confusing productivity with busyness. Doing lots of stuff in a visible manner does not mean you’re being productive. Most of what we do is Shallow Work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;28.772506082725&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;10.306569343066&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport is the author of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1455586692&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=azerialabs-20&amp;amp;linkId=f7e3a219af40298bf6f2bf9380558c35&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=azerialabs-20&amp;amp;l=am2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1455586692&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; (which I highly recommend!) and he argues that if you spend enough time in a state of obsessive shallowness, you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work. Social Media overuse is exactly the type of obsessive shallowness he’s referring to here, but not the only one. He defines Deep Work as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Professional activities performed in a state of distraction free concentration that push your cognitive ability to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skills, and are hard to replicate. Deep work is hard and shallow work is easier and in the absence of clear goals for your job, the visible busyness that surrounds shallow work becomes self-preserving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction. You get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. Therefore, to be good at something is to be well myelinated. Through deliberate practice and by focusing on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific circuit relevant to that skill to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive process triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to start wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits, which in turn effectively strengthens the skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. This all makes a lot of sense, but I can tell from experience that simply knowing these things won’t put you any closer to your goal. I’ve read an entire book on Deep Work and the biggest lesson I learned when trying to implement Deep Work into my daily/weekly schedule is that if you don’t plan it carefully and make it a strong habit, you will fail to develop this skill and automatically fall back to unproductive tinkering. After all, you have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. As it turns out, we all have approximately 4 hours of willpower available each day. Trying to force yourself to finally get started while procrastinating is exactly where your willpower gets depleted in the most unproductive way. If you have a fixed plan, a habit, you save your willpower for the actual task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important lesson I’ve learned is that practice != deliberate practice. Deliberate practice refers to a special type of practice that is purposeful, systematic, and stretches your mind to its limits. Regular practice might include mindless repetitions of the same task, while deliberate practice requires focused attention and is performed with the specific goal of improving performance. The natural tendency of the human brain is to transform repeated behaviors into automatic habits. The more we repeat a task the more mindless it becomes. Mindless activity is the enemy of deliberate practice. Behavioral psychologist James Clear confirms,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Too often, we assume we are getting better simply because we are gaining experience. In reality, we are merely reinforcing our current habits — not improving them.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have the capacity to improve our performance in any area of life if we train our brain in the correct way.  This is easier said than done. Let’s be straight here. Deliberate practice is not a comfortable activity and it requires sustained effort and focus. It is basically the process of failing, over and over again, because through failure we know that we have stretched our limits. Take lifting weights as an example. You lift weights until you fail and have to take a break, which is exactly where your body learns to expand its current limits and prepare to be stronger the next time you perform this activity. Force yourself to take on challenges that are beyond your limits. Pick a project that forces you to learn new concepts and techniques. When you read a scientific paper, systematically look up the words and concepts you don’t understand rather than discarding it with a “I don’t understand half of it anyway” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;31.086956521739&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;13.32298136646&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When performance psychologists began to explore what separates experts, in many different fields, from everyone else, the single coherent answer was: deliberate practice. Our culture loves the story line of the prodigy and the notion that experts posses a inherent talent that separates them from everyone else. But in reality, to master a cognitively demanding task requires this specific form of practice. There are only a few exceptions made for natural talent. K. Anders Ericsson introduced the concept of deliberate practice in his 1993 paper “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/writing/1993-ericsson.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance&lt;/a&gt;“, where he stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“we deny that these differences are immutable, that is, due to innate talent. Only a few exceptions, most notably height, are genetically prescribed. Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K. Anders Ericsson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34.059132260322&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;15.350594821554&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to choose a strategy/philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify. Here are some strategies I extracted from the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1455586692&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=azerialabs-20&amp;amp;linkId=f7e3a219af40298bf6f2bf9380558c35&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=azerialabs-20&amp;amp;l=am2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1455586692&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monastic&lt;/strong&gt;: “This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.” — isolate yourself for long periods of time without distractions; no shallow work allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bimodal&lt;/strong&gt;: “This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.” – dedicate a few consecutive days (like weekends, or a Sunday, for example) for deep work only, at least one day a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rhythmic&lt;/strong&gt;: “This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.” – create a daily habit of three to four hours every day to perform deep work on your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalistic&lt;/strong&gt;: “in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule.” — Not recommended to try out first, since you first need to accustom yourself to deep work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my current lifestyle, I prefer to switch between the Rhythmic and the Bimodal. You don’t have to fit on one box, but you can use these strategies as reference points when developing one that fits your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wpb_wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair enough. It’s difficult to know in advance what could become “your thing”, since our interests vary from person to person and only because I like ARM exploit development, doesn’t mean it is something you would enjoy doing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a skill that can be useful to your current path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t have a path yet, pick a skill that is generally useful or one that you could potentially transform into a career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it a try for minimum 30 hours (deep work!). You might not like it at first. Don’t get discouraged right away. Things we’re not good at are scary and we don’t like doing what we suck at. The trick is to overcome the initial frustration until you get your first rewarding experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Split your 30 hours into seven 4-hour sessions (plus buffer). Set clear goals of what you want to accomplish with this project. Remember, the goal is not to become a master within 30 hours but to use your time efficiently to learn enough so you can judge if you want to continue or switch to another subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your first session to perform extensive information gathering. Look at the resources available to you and pick the ones that stick out as the most useful for completing the project you’ve chosen. If necessary, use the second session to set up the environment (e.g. an analysis environment for Malware analysis including all tools you could possibly need for your first analysis) and define clear goals (e.g. Analyze Malware x). It is important to set clear goals and split them into structured parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you complete two sessions per week, you’ll be done in 3 weeks. Worst case scenario: You realize that you don’t like it, but you have spent 30 hours learning something challenging and new that you wouldn’t have otherwise learned. Best case: You realize that this is actually fun and want to continue it. Having already started, you overcame the most annoying part and can now happily continue developing your skill further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Oliver Taylor, a student at England’s University of Birmingham, is a twenty-something with brown eyes, light stubble, and a slightly stiff smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20200715&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1525792093&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEG6E0L5&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;A combination photograph showing an image purporting to be of British student and freelance writer Oliver Taylor (L) and a heat map of the same photograph produced by Tel Aviv-based deepfake detection company Cyabra is seen in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters. The heat map, which was produced using one of Cyabra's algorithms, highlights areas of suspected computer manipulation. The digital inconsistencies were one of several indicators used by experts to determine that Taylor was an online mirage. Cyabra/Handout via REUTERS&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A combination photograph showing an image purporting to be of British student and freelance writer Oliver Taylor (L) and a heat map of the same photograph produced by Tel Aviv-based deepfake detection company Cyabra is seen in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters. The heat map, which was produced using one of Cyabra's algorithms, highlights areas of suspected computer manipulation. The digital inconsistencies were one of several indicators used by experts to determine that Taylor was an online mirage. Cyabra/Handout via REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online profiles describe him as a coffee lover and politics junkie who was raised in a traditional Jewish home. His half dozen freelance editorials and blog posts reveal an active interest in anti-Semitism and Jewish affairs, with bylines in the Jerusalem Post and the Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch? Oliver Taylor seems to be an elaborate fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His university says it has no record of him. He has no obvious online footprint beyond an account on the question-and-answer site Quora, where he was active for two days in March. Two newspapers that published his work say they have tried and failed to confirm his identity. And experts in deceptive imagery used state-of-the-art forensic analysis programs to determine that Taylor’s profile photo is a hyper-realistic forgery - a “deepfake.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is behind Taylor isn’t known to Reuters. Calls to the U.K. phone number he supplied to editors drew an automated error message and he didn’t respond to messages left at the Gmail address he used for correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters was alerted to Taylor by London academic Mazen Masri, who drew international attention in late 2018 when he helped launch an Israeli lawsuit against the surveillance company NSO on behalf of alleged Mexican victims of the company’s phone hacking technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an article in U.S. Jewish newspaper The Algemeiner, Taylor had accused Masri and his wife, Palestinian rights campaigner Ryvka Barnard, of being “known terrorist sympathizers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masri and Barnard were taken aback by the allegation, which they deny. But they were also baffled as to why a university student would single them out. Masri said he pulled up Taylor’s profile photo. He couldn’t put his finger on it, he said, but something about the young man’s face “seemed off.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six experts interviewed by Reuters say the image has the characteristics of a deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The distortion and inconsistencies in the background are a tell-tale sign of a synthesized image, as are a few glitches around his neck and collar,” said digital image forensics pioneer Hany Farid, who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artist Mario Klingemann, who regularly uses deepfakes in his work, said the photo “has all the hallmarks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m 100 percent sure,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Backstory_image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://graphics.reuters.com/CYBER-DEEPFAKE/ACTIVIST/nmovajgnxpa/img/olivertaylor.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Backstory_text-container&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Backstory_headline&quot;&gt;These faces are not real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Backstory_description&quot;&gt;Many “deepfakes” look odd, but technology is fast improving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘A VENTRILOQUIST’S DUMMY’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taylor persona is a rare in-the-wild example of a phenomenon that has emerged as a key anxiety of the digital age: The marriage of deepfakes and disinformation.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat is drawing increasing concern in Washington and Silicon Valley. Last year House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff warned that computer-generated video could “turn a world leader into a ventriloquist’s dummy.” Last month Facebook announced the conclusion of its Deepfake Detection Challenge - a competition intended to help researchers automatically identify falsified footage. Last week online publication The Daily Beast revealed a network of deepfake journalists - part of a larger group of bogus personas seeding propaganda online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepfakes like Taylor are dangerous because they can help build “a totally untraceable identity,” said Dan Brahmy, whose Israel-based startup Cyabra specializes in detecting such images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brahmy said investigators chasing the origin of such photos are left “searching for a needle in a haystack – except the needle doesn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taylor appears to have had no online presence until he started writing articles in late December. The University of Birmingham said in a statement it could not find “any record of this individual using these details.” Editors at the Jerusalem Post and The Algemeiner say they published Taylor after he pitched them stories cold over email. He didn’t ask for payment, they said, and they didn’t take aggressive steps to vet his identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not a counterintelligence operation,” Algemeiner Editor-in-chief Dovid Efune said, although he noted that the paper had introduced new safeguards since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Reuters began asking about Taylor, The Algemeiner and the Times of Israel deleted his work. Taylor emailed both papers protesting the removal, but Times of Israel Opinion Editor Miriam Herschlag said she rebuffed him after he failed to prove his identity. Efune said he didn’t respond to Taylor’s messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Slideshow_container Slideshow_small Slideshow_standard&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20200715&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1525792095&amp;amp;r=LYNXNPEG6E0LG&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Slideshow &lt;span class=&quot;Slideshow_count&quot;&gt;(2 Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jerusalem Post and Arutz Sheva have kept Taylor’s articles online, although the latter removed the “terrorist sympathizers” reference following a complaint from Masri and Barnard. The Post’s editor-in-chief, Yaakov Katz, didn’t respond when asked whether Taylor’s work would stay up. Arutz Sheva editor Yoni Kempinski said only that “in many cases” news outlets “use pseudonyms to byline opinion articles.” Kempinski declined to elaborate or say whether he considered Taylor a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver Taylor’s articles drew minimal engagement on social media, but the Times of Israel’s Herschlag said they were still dangerous - not only because they could distort the public discourse but also because they risked making people in her position less willing to take chances on unknown writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely we need to screen out impostors and up our defenses,” she said. “But I don’t want to set up these barriers that prevent new voices from being heard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb, the vacation rental online marketplace, initiated a feature this week offering customers the chance to donate money to hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbnb's latest attempt to appease hosts and customers amid a tumultuous year was met with a searing backlash on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online vacation rental marketplace, headquartered in San Francisco, initiated a feature this week offering customers the chance to donate money and &quot;kindness cards&quot; to hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today we're introducing a new way to connect with your favorite hosts. Now you can create personalized kindness cards that make it easy to send a message of appreciation or encouragement, with the option to add a contribution. We hope these cards will make hosts smile, and bring a little joy your way,&quot; a message from the company to customers read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Airbnb has lost its f---ing head, why would I donate to my host? I can't even afford one house.&quot; Twitter user olenskae fumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Airbnb has lost its fucking head. Why would I donate to my host? I can't even afford one house. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JZspJqyoPB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JZspJqyoPB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Rosaleen (@olenskae) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/olenskae/status/1283000201993748482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based New York Times tech reporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1283089286145781761&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mike Isaac wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Airbnb has created a mechanism in which you can....donate money to landlords....many of whom have overextended themselves by leveraging multiple properties which they rented out pre-covid, and are now going empty...it's like the mortgage-backed securities of the sharing economy?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With soaring joblessness and a struggle for many to make monthly rent payments amid the pandemic, the move to raise money for hosts who often own and profit from vacant investment properties was seen as tone deaf by many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;They've created this because their hosts absolutely hate them right now, due to the fact that their homes are largely uninhabited and Airbnb won't (cant) pay the hosts for their empty houses. Crazy situation where basically the entire platform has turned on them,&quot; Isaac speculated on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emails sent out by the company this week explaining the feature read in part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Like all of us, hosts on Airbnb are impacted by COVID-19, and many of them are unable to welcome guests. Now more than ever, it's important to reach out and support one another—even in small ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s your responsibility to determine whether your contribution is eligible for a tax deduction or credit,&quot; the posting on the Airbnb website concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media postings expressing displeasure at the move continued to pour out on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got this email too. Clicked to check it out - they have you select a card, write the message &amp;amp; do contribution on 3 separate screens. So you could miss that donating is an option until after writing a message - at which point you're perfectly primed to feel guilted into it,&quot; Twitter user amygoodchild wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was due to be a banner year for the Airbnb, with an expectation of one of the hottest stock-market debuts. The company was previously valued at more than $50 billion, but with global travel nearly at a standstill its valuation has since dropped to $18 billion as the company faces an existential crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnbs-coronavirus-crisis-burning-cash-angry-hosts-and-an-uncertain-future-11586365860&quot;&gt;the Wall Street Journal reported&lt;/a&gt; that the home-sharing giant is expected to lose $1 billion through the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the backlash a spokesperson from Airbnb told SFGATE, “during this challenging time we heard from many Airbnb guests who were interested in supporting and reconnecting with past hosts. In the spirit of rekindling connections, we developed a new feature that allows guests to send virtual cards with messages of support and encouragement to hosts who provided excellent hospitality. If they wish, guests have the option to add a voluntary financial contribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
