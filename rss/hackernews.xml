<title>EU Agencies Falsely Report More Than 550 Archive.org URLs as Terrorist Content</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament is set to vote on legislation that would require websites that host user-generated content to take down material reported as terrorist content within one hour. We have some examples of current notices sent to the Internet Archive that we think illustrate very well why this requirement would be harmful to the free sharing of information and freedom of speech that the European Union pledges to safeguard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, the Internet Archive has received a series of email notices from Europol’s European Union Internet Referral Unit (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/eu-internet-referal-unit-eu-iru&quot;&gt;EU IRU&lt;/a&gt;) falsely identifying hundreds of URLs on archive.org as “terrorist propaganda”. At least one of these mistaken URLs was also identified as terrorist content in a separate take down notice from the French government’s L’Office Central de Lutte contre la Criminalité liée aux Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication (OCLCTIC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive has a few staff members that process takedown notices from law enforcement who operate in the Pacific time zone. Most of the falsely identified URLs mentioned here (including the report from the French government) were sent to us in the middle of the night – between midnight and 3am Pacific – and all of the reports were sent outside of the business hours of the Internet Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-hour requirement essentially means that we would need to take reported URLs down automatically and do our best to review them after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be bad enough if the mistaken URLs in these examples were for a set of relatively obscure items on our site, but the EU IRU’s lists include some of the most visited pages on archive.org and materials that obviously have high scholarly and research value. See a summary below with specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU IRU’s mistaken notices&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 550 archive.org URLs were falsely identified by the EU IRU in the past week as terrorist propaganda, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;major collection pages&lt;/strong&gt; (displaying millions of items), many pertaining only to material preserved and posted directly by the Internet Archive, others that included user-uploaded content, e.g.:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scholarly articles&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g.:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Government-produced broadcasts and reports&lt;/strong&gt;, e.g.:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User-posted materials&lt;/strong&gt; that clearly do not fit the EU IRU notices’ description as terrorist propaganda, e.g.:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, these examples are only a few of the some 550 falsely identified URLs. The erroneous reports continue to be sent to us by the EU IRU (the most recent example was sent a day prior to this post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;French Government’s (OCLCTIC) mistaken notice&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OCLCTIC emailed us a take down notice a few days ago (April 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) identifying an item making commentary on the Quran as including “provocation of acts of terrorism or apology for such acts”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/002Baqarah_201712&quot;&gt;https://archive.org/details/002Baqarah_201712&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report stated that blocking procedures may be implemented against us if we did not remove the content in 24 hours. This URL was also on one of the lists that the EU IRU reported to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we are left to ask – how can the proposed legislation realistically be said to honor freedom of speech if these are the types of reports that are currently coming from EU law enforcement and designated governmental reporting entities? It is not possible for us to process these reports using human review within a very limited timeframe like one hour. Are we to simply take what’s reported as “terrorism” at face value and risk the automatic removal of things like THE primary collection page for all books on archive.org?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Urgent Quest for Slower, Better News</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-urgent-quest-for-slower-better-news</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-urgent-quest-for-slower-better-news</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;180.91170925848&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I decided to try an experiment with my media diet. Usually, in the morning, I skim e-mail newsletters in my in-box, scroll through my Twitter feed, and peruse the news apps on my phone; later, in the office, I tap through my notifications and monitor more than a dozen news-related apps, including Facebook and Twitter, while juggling other tasks. I usually feel as though I’m managing to stay abreast of the day’s biggest news stories, but my reading tends to be fragmentary—I’m only skimming a story or absorbing a partial update. Although I’m reading more than ever before, it often feels like I’m understanding less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t stopped getting my news in this way, but I’m trying to change my ways to a certain extent. I’ve adopted a new ritual: reading the print edition of the New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; over breakfast and on my commute. Since the early two-thousands, when I was a cub reporter at the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve had the newspaper delivered daily to my door, but, as I’ve started getting more and more of my news online, I’ve been neglecting it. Having returned to spending uninterrupted time with the print newspaper each morning, I’m engaging with the news in a more focussed way. Certainly, I’m able to read more broadly. I’ve read articles that weren’t in my social-media feeds, or that I missed while scrolling through my apps: reporting on efforts to make Copenhagen a carbon-neutral city, on talks between the United States and the Taliban, on a new study that found that the size of bullets affects mortality rates in shootings. It seems to me that I’ve become better informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have tried such experiments, of course. And much has been made of how being tethered to our phones affects everything from our attention spans to our psychological well-being. In his new book, “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525536515/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World&lt;/a&gt;,” Cal Newport, a computer-science professor at Georgetown University, marshals evidence that the addictive properties of our devices are not accidental but, rather, the product of careful thinking by tech companies about the feedback loops that will keep people returning to them. Newport’s main indictment is of social-media platforms, but he also argues that people need to rethink the way they consume news. Exposure to the online torrent of “incomplete, redundant, and often contradictory” information that now invariably follows a major news event is counterproductive and leaves us less informed, he writes. Even when nothing earth-shattering is happening on a given day, he continues, people follow a compulsive pattern of media consumption, triggered by any hint of boredom. “If you’re interested in politics, for example, and lean toward the left side of the political spectrum, this sequence might go from CNN.com, to the New York &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; homepage, to &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;, to the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, to your Twitter feed, and finally to your Facebook timeline,” he explains. Techies might add Hacker News and Reddit; sports fans, ESPN. Media companies profit from this “lucrative tic.” “Checking ten different sites ten times a day makes them money, even if it doesn’t leave you more informed than checking one good site once a day,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt; published an &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://archives.cjr.org/feature/overload_1.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; with the headline “Overload!,” which examined news fatigue in “an age of too much information.” When “Overload!” was published, BlackBerrys still dominated the smartphone market, push notifications hadn’t yet to come to the iPhone, retweets weren’t built into Twitter, and BuzzFeed News did not exist. Looking back, the idea of suffering from information overload in 2008 seems almost quaint. Now, more than a decade later, a fresh reckoning seems to be upon us. Last year, Tim Cook, the chief executive officer of Apple, unveiled a new iPhone feature, Screen Time, which allows users to track their phone activity. During an &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/apple-ceo-tim-cook-monitoring-his-own-iphone-usage-with-screen-time.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; conference, Cook said that he was monitoring his own usage and had “slashed” the number of notifications he receives. “I think it has become clear to all of us that some of us are spending too much time on our devices,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth considering how news organizations have contributed to the problems Newport and Cook describe. Media outlets have been reduced to fighting over a shrinking share of our attention online; as Facebook, Google, and other tech platforms have come to monopolize our digital lives, news organizations have had to assume a subsidiary role, relying on those sites for traffic. That dependence exerts a powerful influence on which stories are pursued, how they’re presented, and the speed and volume at which they’re turned out. In “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/1101981113/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;World Without Mind: the Existential Threat of Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;,” published in 2017, Franklin Foer, the former editor-in-chief of &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt;, writes about “a mad, shameless chase to gain clicks through Facebook” and “a relentless effort to game Google’s algorithms.” Newspapers and magazines have long sought to command large readerships, but these efforts used to be primarily the province of circulation departments; newsrooms were insulated from these pressures, with little sense of what readers actually read. Nowadays, at both legacy news organizations and those that were born online, audience metrics are everywhere. At the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, everyone in the newsroom has access to an internal, custom-built &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/technology/personaltech/metrics-media.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analytics tool&lt;/a&gt; that shows how many people are reading each story, where those people are coming from, what devices they are using, how the stories are being promoted, and so on. Additional, commercially built audience tools, such as Chartbeat and Google Analytics, are also widely available. As the editor of newyorker.com, I keep a browser tab open to Parse.ly, an application that shows me, in real time, various readership numbers for the stories on our Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even at news organizations committed to insuring that editorial values—and not commercial interests—determine coverage, it can be difficult for editors to decide how much attention should be paid to these metrics. In “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374279624/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Breaking News: the Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters&lt;/a&gt;,” Alan Rusbridger, the former editor-in-chief of the &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, recounts the gradual introduction of metrics into his newspaper’s decision-making processes. The goal, he writes, is to have “a data-informed newsroom, not a data-led one.” But it’s hard to know when the former crosses over into being the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For digital-media organizations sustained by advertising, the temptations are almost irresistible. Each time a reader comes to a news site from a social-media or search platform, the visit, no matter how brief, brings in some amount of revenue. Foer calls this phenomenon “drive-by traffic.” As Facebook and Google have grown, they have pushed down advertising prices, and revenue-per-click from drive-by traffic has shrunk; even so, it continues to provide an incentive for any number of depressing modern media trends, including clickbait headlines, the proliferation of hastily written “hot takes,” and increasingly homogeneous coverage as everyone chases the same trending news stories, so as not to miss out on the traffic they will bring. Any content that is cheap to produce and has the potential to generate clicks on Facebook or Google is now a revenue-generating “audience opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, a subscription-based model should be a dramatic improvement, substituting for the relentless pursuit of page views the superior goal of producing journalism that can’t be found anywhere else and is worth paying for. Foer asserts that subscription-based reader revenue is the only viable path for a media outlet seeking to maintain its editorial identity. There is a reassuring freedom in his imagined business model: instead of chasing legions of visitors who land on your site from a Google search on some trending topic and never return, a publication might focus on its true fans. “Media need to scale back their ambitions, to return to their niches, to reclaim the loyalty of core audiences,” Foer writes. “To rescue themselves, media will need to charge readers, and readers will need to pay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most common approach to subscription growth relies, to a fair extent, on many of the same tactics that ad-driven media businesses employ. Most news organizations pursuing consumer revenue have adopted a metered-paywall strategy, which gives readers access to a certain number of free articles per month before requiring a subscription for access. This allows nonsubscribers to get to know the publication, sampling a piece here and there, perhaps in the course of a few months or longer, before deciding to pay. And yet Facebook and Google remain essential gateways for getting readers into this so-called subscription funnel and pulling them through it. The tyranny of the trending story still holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of transforming casual visitors into regular readers, moreover, creates its own set of incentives. The onslaught of news-related push notifications on our phones is due, in part, to the need to draw readers back, again and again. And enticing readers to subscribe requires the constant creation of new and varied material. It’s not enough for readers to immerse themselves in an article or two per month; they must develop &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/paths-to-subscription/single-page/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;loyalty&lt;/a&gt; to a site, returning repeatedly until they hit the paywall. Quality is paramount—but it must also be produced at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;126.15827338129&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have begun to wonder, like Newport, whether the sheer volume of online news actually runs counter to the goal of keeping people informed. Research on this question is surprisingly scant. “My hunch is that readers aren’t less informed than before,” Pablo Boczkowski, a professor of communication studies at Northwestern University, told me. “They’re differently informed.” Among Boczkowski’s areas of research is how young people interact with the news today. Most do not go online seeking the news; instead, they encounter it incidentally, on social media. They might get on their phones or computers to check for updates or messages from their friends, and, along the way, encounter a post from a news site. Few people sit down in the morning to read the print newspaper or make a point of watching the TV news in the evening. Instead, they are constantly “being touched, rubbed by the news,” Bockzkowski said. “It’s part of the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well can news be absorbed by osmosis? Studies have found that people bounce between tasks on their computers at stunning rates; a paper published last year found a median switch time of eleven seconds. Introduce mobile devices into the mix, and the switching is even faster. It’s no wonder that news is getting chopped up into smaller bits. “If you’re an average site, you have five to seven seconds to tell your story,” Boczkowski told me. It seems reasonable to guess, therefore, that people are now more aware, on a general level, of different topics in the news, but that they also have less depth of understanding in any one area. Even those readers who are inclined to engage deeply and broadly with the news are constrained by social-media filter bubbles, within which agreeable content, posted by people in their networks, is prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central purpose of journalism is the creation of an informed citizenry. And yet––especially in an environment of free-floating, ambient news––it’s not entirely clear what it means to be informed. In his book “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0684827298/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Good Citizen&lt;/a&gt;,” from 1998, Michael Schudson, a sociologist who now teaches at Columbia’s journalism school, argues that the ideal of the “informed citizen”––a person with the time, discipline, and expertise needed to steep him- or herself in politics and become fully engaged in our civic life—has always been an unrealistic one. The Founders, he writes, expected citizens to possess relatively little political knowledge; the ideal of the informed citizen didn’t take hold until more than a century later, when Progressive-era reformers sought to rein in the party machines and empower individual voters to make thoughtful decisions. (It was also during this period that the independent press began to emerge as a commercial phenomenon, and the press corps became increasingly professionalized.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schudson proposes a model for citizenship that he believes to be more true to life: the “monitorial citizen”—a person who is watchful of what’s going on in politics but isn’t always fully engaged. “The monitorial citizen engages in environmental surveillance more than information-gathering,” he writes. “Picture parents watching small children at the community pool. They are not gathering information; they are keeping an eye on the scene. They look inactive, but they are poised for action if action is required.” Schudson contends that monitorial citizens might even be “better informed than citizens of the past in that, somewhere in their heads, they have more bits of information.” When the time is right, they will deploy this information—to vote a corrupt lawmaker out of office, say, or to approve an important ballot measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the social-media age could make us better monitorial citizens. But Schudson’s model, which assumes that monitorial citizens will be activated at appropriate moments, didn’t anticipate the ease with which Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms can set off panics at the pool. The danger today—as phenomena such as Brexit and anti-vaccine activism demonstrate—is one of false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the cognitive scientists Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach published the book “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/039918435X/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone&lt;/a&gt;.” Their book, which is about the perils of superficial knowledge, offers as good an explanation as any of how our social-media-based news ecosystem is leading to undesirable outcomes in our democracy. People vastly overestimate what they know, and their unjustifiably strong opinions are reinforced by other people who are similarly ill-informed, creating self-reinforcing communities of misinformation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When group members don’t know much but share a position, members of the group can reinforce one another’s sense of understanding, leading everyone to feel like their position is justified and their mission is clear, even when there is no real expertise to give it solid support. Everyone sees everyone else as justifying their view so that opinion rests on a mirage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same year, my colleague Elizabeth Kolbert cited Sloman and Fernbach’s work in a piece called “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds&quot;&gt;Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds&lt;/a&gt;.” “If your position on, say, the Affordable Care Act is baseless and I rely on it, then my opinion is also baseless,” she explains. “When I talk to Tom and he decides he agrees with me, his opinion is also baseless, but now that the three of us concur we feel that much more smug about our views. If we all now dismiss as unconvincing any information that contradicts our opinion, you get, well, the Trump Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there is a way to puncture this illusion of knowledge. It involves forcing people to explain in detail what would happen if their views on a specific public-policy issue were put into practice. It’s when we try to provide a “causal explanation,” Sloman and Ferbach write, that we realize how ignorant we are. That realization, in turn, leads us to become less extreme in our views. This insight has an obvious implication for media: depth matters. Journalism that engages with complexity, examines the implications of proposed policies, and offers the public rigorous analysis can lead to a more informed—and less polarized—citizenry. And yet, if Schudson is right, then only a small portion of readers will have the time, inclination, and disposition to become so ideally informed. Far more people will be monitorial, rather than informed, citizens—and, thanks to social media and high-volume news operations, they will be easily alarmed and distracted. Adding yet more stories to this maelstrom may make a certain economic sense for media organizations, but it won’t necessarily make us any better informed. It might only further fragment our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;67.827951564077&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we need to recalibrate our relationship with media—to rethink how we ought to consume information more generally and what it means to be informed. In the recent book “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0190641797/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Slow Media: Why ‘Slow’ is Satisfying, Sustainable, and Smart&lt;/a&gt;,” the journalist and media scholar Jennifer Rauch traces a movement that began to coalesce about a decade ago. In 2010, a document called “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Slow Media Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;” was published, online, by Sabria David, Jörg Blumtritt, and Benedikt Köhler—a trio of Germans with backgrounds in media and technology. It urged both journalists and readers to draw inspiration from the Slow Food movement, which emphasizes quality and timelessness. “Slow Media are not about fast consumption but about choosing the ingredients mindfully and preparing them in a concentrated manner,” the authors wrote. “Slow Media cannot be consumed casually, but provoke the full concentration of their users. As with the production of a good meal, which demands the full attention of all senses by the cook and his guests, Slow Media can only be consumed with pleasure in focused alertness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauch points to the U.K.-based quarterly &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.slow-journalism.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Delayed Gratification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was established in 2011, as an example of Slow Media in action. &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Delayed Gratification&lt;/em&gt;, which has a Web site but is primarily print-based, describes itself as “the world’s first Slow Journalism magazine.” It promises to revisit “the events of the previous three months to see what happened after the dust settled and the news agenda moved on” and declares itself “proud to be ‘Last to Breaking News.’ ” Meanwhile, earlier this year, James Harding, the former director of news and current affairs at the BBC; Katie Vanneck-Smith, the former president of Dow Jones; and Matthew Barzun, the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, launched &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tortoisemedia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tortoise Media&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to publish five digital stories a day, along with a quarterly print magazine. Tortoise was formed as a direct response to the overwhelming amount of “daily noise” in the news ecosystem. “The problem isn’t just fake news or junk news,” a statement on the Web site says, “because there’s a lot of good—it’s just that there’s so much of it and so much of it is the same. In a hurry, partial, and confusing. Too many newsrooms chasing the news, but missing the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could journalism in general get slower? As I read about the Slow Media movement—which, so far, seems to be a mostly European phenomenon—I inevitably thought about trends in the magazine industry in the United States, where publications are experimenting with paywalls and churning out digital content. The appeal of Slow Media is that it pushes back against the technological pressures that are shaping journalism more broadly. (Newport advocates Slow Media in a section of his book, urging readers to join “the attention resistance.”) It is an attempt to take back control of the way we experience the news. It is also about relinquishing the illusion of knowledge that the passive consumption of news on social media facilitates and bringing our best selves to the act of becoming informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge for all media organizations, slow or not, is to chart an economically sustainable, responsible course through this landscape of conflicting incentives and ideals. The pressures for speed and volume created by the digital age can’t be ignored—but they can be resisted. Even as publishers try to move more quickly, they can still ask themselves whether granular coverage in a given area is really making readers better informed. They can still consider sitting out certain trending stories, and they can do more, across the board, to engage with complexity. Readers, too, can begin to realize they’re being ill-served by the current media cacophony. Let’s hope that, when they search for alternatives, they will still be able to find journalism capable of rising above the din.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google launches an end-to-end AI platform</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/google-expands-its-ai-services/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/google-expands-its-ai-services/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;As expected, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; used the second day of its annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-cloud-next-2019/&quot;&gt;Cloud Next conference&lt;/a&gt; to shine a spotlight on its AI tools. The company made a dizzying number of announcements today, but at the core of all of these new tools and services is the company’s plan to democratize AI and machine learning with pre-built models and easier to use services, while also giving more advanced developers the tools to build their own custom models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of today’s announcements is the beta launch of the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/&quot;&gt;AI Platform&lt;/a&gt;. The idea here is to offer developers and data scientists an end-to-end service for building, testing and deploying their own models. To do this, the service brings together a variety of existing and new products that allow you to build a full data pipeline to pull in data, label it (with the help of a new built-in labeling service) and then either use existing classification, object recognition or entity extraction models, or use existing tools like AutoML or the Cloud Machine Learning engine to train and deploy custom models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AI Platform is this place where, if you are taking this terrifying journey from a journeyman idea of how you can use AI in your enterprise, all the way through launch and a safe, reliable deployment, the AI Platform help you move between each of these stages in a safe way so that you can start with exploratory data analysis, start to build models using your data scientists, decide that you want to use this specific model, and then with essentially one click be able to deploy it,” a Google spokesperson said during a press conference ahead of today’s official announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1810433 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/automl.jpg?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;353&quot; height=&quot;238&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/automl.jpg 692w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/automl.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/automl.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/automl.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/automl.jpg?resize=50,34 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px&quot;/&gt;But there is plenty more AI news, too, mostly courtesy of Cloud &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/automl/&quot;&gt;AutoML&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s tool for automating the model training process for developers with limited machine learning expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these new features is &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/google-cloud-smart-analytics-accelerates-your-business-transformation&quot;&gt;AutoML Tables&lt;/a&gt;, which takes existing tabular data that may sit in Google’s BigQuery database or in a storage service and automatically creates a model that will predict the value of a given column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also new is AutoML Video Intelligence (now in beta), which can automatically annotate and tag video, using object recognition to classify video content and make it searchable. For detecting objects in photos, Google also today launched the beta of AutoML Vision and for applications that run at the edge, Google launched the beta AutoML Vision Edge, which includes the ability to then deploy these models to edge devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1810538&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;439&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg 3891w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg?resize=768,329 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg?resize=680,292 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_20190410_095309.jpg?resize=50,21 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of enterprise data comes in the form of straightforward, unstructured text, though. For these use cases, Google today launched the betas of its custom entity extraction service and a custom sentiment analysis service. Both of these tools can be customized to fit the needs of a given organization. It’s one thing to use a generic entity extraction service to understand documents, but for most businesses, the real value here is to be able to pull out information that may be very specific to their needs and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about documents, Google also today announced the beta of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/document-understanding/&quot;&gt;Document Understanding API&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new platform that can automatically analyze scanned or digital documents. The service basically combines the ability to turn a scanned page into machine-readable text and then use Google’s other machine learning services to extract data from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After introducing it in preview last year, the company also today launched the beta of its Contact Center AI. This service, which was built with partners like Twilio, Vonage, Cisco, Five9, Genesys and Mitel, offers a full contact center AI solution that uses tools like Dialogflow and Google’s text-to-speech capabilities to allow its users to build a virtual agent system (and when things go awry, it can pass the customer to a human agent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that many enterprises struggle to combine all of these tools and services into a coherent platform for their own needs. Maybe it’s no surprise then that Google also today launched it first AI solution for a specific vertical: Google Cloud Retail. This service combines the company’s Vision Product Search, Recommendations AI and AutoML Tables into a single solution for tackling retail use cases. Chances are, we will see more of the packages for other verticals in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VC’s have just changed the ~50-year old social contract with startup employees. In doing so they may have removed one of the key incentives that made startups different from working in a large company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most startup employee’s &lt;em&gt;startup stock options are now a bad deal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Startups Offer Stock Options&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In tech startups stock options were here almost from the beginning, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialpolicy.org/dscprimerstockoption2a.htm&quot;&gt;first offered to the founders in 1957 at Fairchild Semiconductor&lt;/a&gt;, the first chip startup in Silicon Valley. As Venture Capital emerged as an industry in the mid 1970’s, investors in venture-funded startups began to give stock options to &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;their employees. On its surface this was a pretty radical idea. The investors were giving away part of their ownership of the company — not just to the founders, but to all employees. Why would they do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock options for all employees of startups served several purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because startups didn’t have much cash and couldn’t compete with large companies in salary offers, stock options dangled in front of a potential employee were like offering a lottery ticket in exchange for a lower salary. Startup employees calculated that a) their hard work could change the odds and b) someday the stock options they were vesting might make them into millionaires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors bet that by offering prospective hires a stake in the company’s future growth- &lt;em&gt;with a visible time horizon of a payoff&lt;/em&gt; – employees would act more like owners and work harder– and that would align employee interests with the investor interests. And the bet worked. It drove the relentless “do whatever it takes” culture of 20&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;century Silicon Valley. We slept under the tables, and pulled all-nighters to get to first customer ship, man the booths at trade shows or ship products to make quarterly revenue – all because it was “our” company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While founders had more stock than the other employees, they had the same type of stock options as the rest of the employees, and they only made money when everyone else did (though a lot more of it.) Back then, when Angel/Seed investing didn’t exist, to get the company started, founders put a lot more on the line – going without a salary, mortgaging their homes etc. This “we’re all in it together” kept founders and employees aligned on incentives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of a stock option was a simple idea – you received an option (an offer) to buy a part of the company via &lt;em&gt;common &lt;/em&gt;stock options (called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/03/05/whats-the-difference-between-an-iso-and-an-nso/&quot;&gt;ISOs or NSOs&lt;/a&gt;) at a low price (the “strike price”.) If the company was successful, you could sell it at a much higher price when the company went public (when its shares were listed on a stock exchange and could be freely traded) or was acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn’t get to own your stock options all at once. The stock trickled out over four years, as you would “vest” 1/48&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;of the option each month. And just to make sure you were in the company for at least a year, with most stock option plans, unless you stayed an entire year, you wouldn’t vest any stock.&lt;/p&gt;

The founders got most of the &lt;em&gt;common &lt;/em&gt;stock. Early employees got a smaller percentage, and later employees received even a smaller piece – fractions of a percent – versus the double digits the founders owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;century, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00661.pdf&quot;&gt;the best companies IPO’d in 6-8 years from startup&lt;/a&gt; (and in the Dot-Com bubble of 1996-1999 that could be as short as 2-3 years.) Of the four startups I was in that went public, it took as long as six years and as short as three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing to note is that all employees – founders, early employees and later ones – all had the same vesting deal – four years – and &lt;em&gt;no one made money on stock options until a “liquidity event&lt;/em&gt;” (a fancy word to mean when the company went public or got sold.) The rationale was that since there was no way for investors to make money until then, neither should anyone else.  Everyone—investors, founders and startup employees—was, so to speak, in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startup Compensation Changes with Growth Capital – 12 Years to an IPO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Much has changed about the economics of startups in the two decades. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marksuster&quot;&gt;Mark Suster&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://upfront.com/&quot;&gt;Upfront Capital&lt;/a&gt; has a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://bothsidesofthetable.com/a-deep-dive-into-what-has-really-changed-in-venture-capital-f5d225f7f8&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that summarizes these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big idea is that unlike in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;century when there were two phases of funding startups–&lt;em&gt;Seed &lt;/em&gt;capital and &lt;em&gt;Venture &lt;/em&gt;capital–today there is a new, third phase. It’s called &lt;em&gt;Growth &lt;/em&gt;capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suster points out that &lt;em&gt;the longer the company stays private, the more valuable it becomes&lt;/em&gt;. And if during this time VC’s can hold onto their pro-rata (fancy word for what percentage of the startup they own), they can make a ton more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of Growth capital is that if that by staying private longer, all the growth upside that went to the public markets (Wall Street) could instead be made by the private investors (the VC’s and Growth Investors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three examples Suster uses – Salesforce, Google and Amazon – show how much more valuable the companies were &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;their IPOs. Before these three went public, they weren’t unicorns – that is their market cap was less than a billion dollars. Twelve years later, Salesforce’s market cap was $18 billion, Google’s was $162 billion, and Amazon’s was $17 billion.&lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;25052&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2019/04/10/startup-stock-options-why-a-good-deal-has-gone-bad/growth-appreciation/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1854,891&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;growth appreciation&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=468&amp;amp;h=225&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-25052 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=468&amp;amp;h=225&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;468&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; srcset=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=468&amp;amp;h=225 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=936&amp;amp;h=450 936w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=72 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=144 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;h=369 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To Suster’s point, it isn’t that startups today can’t raise money by going public, it’s that their &lt;em&gt;investors can make &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;more money by keeping them private and going public later&lt;/em&gt; – now 10-12 years&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;And currently there is an influx of capital to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Founders Rule&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The emergence of Growth capital, and pushing an IPO out a decade or more, has led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/11/when-founders-go-too-far&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;dramatic shift in the balance of power&lt;/a&gt; between founders and investors. For three decades, from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, the rules of the game were that a company must become profitable and hire a professional CEO before an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made sense. Twentieth-century companies, competing in slower-moving markets, could thrive for long periods on a single innovation. If the VCs threw out the founder, the professional CEO who stepped in could grow a company without creating something new. In that environment, replacing a founder was the rational decision. But 21st century companies face compressed technology cycles, which create the need for continuous innovation over a longer period of time. Who leads that process best? Often it is founders, whose creativity, comfort with disorder, and risk-taking are more valuable at a time when companies need to retain a startup culture even as they grow large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the observation that founders added value during the long runup in the growth stage, VCs began to cede compensation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/11/when-founders-go-too-far&quot;&gt;board control&lt;/a&gt; to founders. (See the HBR story &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/11/when-founders-go-too-far&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startup Stock Options – Why A Good Deal Has Gone Bad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While founders in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;century had more stock than the rest of their employees, they had &lt;em&gt;the same type &lt;/em&gt;of stock options. &lt;em&gt;Today, that’s not true&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, when a startup first forms, the founders grant themselves &lt;em&gt;Restricted Stock Awards&lt;/em&gt; (RSA) instead of common stock options. Essentially the company sells them the stock at zero cost, and they &lt;a href=&quot;https://500.co/founder-equity-101/&quot;&gt;reverse vest.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today that’s less true. Founders take a lot less risk, raise multimillion-dollar seed rounds and have the ability to cash out way before a liquidity event.&lt;a href=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;25056&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://steveblank.com/2019/04/10/startup-stock-options-why-a-good-deal-has-gone-bad/founders-vs-employees-stock/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1295,647&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;founders vs employees stock&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=150&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg?w=468&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-25056&quot; src=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=150&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; srcset=&quot;https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=150 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg?w=600&amp;amp;h=300 600w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/founders-vs-employees-stock.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=75 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early employees take an equal risk that the company will crater, and they often work equally as hard.  However, today founders own 30-50 times more than a startup’s early employees. (What has happened in founder compensation and board control has mirrored the growth in corporate CEO compensation. In the last 50 years, corporate CEO pay went from 20 times an average employee to over 300 times their compensation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the founder/early employee stock disparity, &lt;em&gt;the VC’s have moved the liquidity goal posts but haven’t moved the vesting goal posts &lt;/em&gt;for non-founders. Consider that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://carta.com/blog/employment-tenure-startups/&quot;&gt;median tenure in a startup is 2 years&lt;/a&gt;. By year three, 50% of the employees will be gone. If you’re an early employee, today &lt;em&gt;the company may not go public until eight years after you vest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why should non-founding employees of startups care? You’ll still own your stock, and you can leave and join another startup. There are four problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First, as the company raises more money, the value of your initial stock option grant gets diluted by the new money in. (VC’s typically have pro-rata rights to keep their percentage of ownership intact, but employees don’t.) So while the VCs gain the upside from keeping a startup private, employees get the downside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, when IPO’s no longer happen within the near time horizon of an employee’s tenure, the original rationale of stock options – offering prospective hires a stake in the company’s future growth with a visible time horizon of a payoff for their hard work – has disappeared. Now there’s &lt;em&gt;little financial reason to stay longer than the initial grant vesting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, as the fair market value of the stock rises (to what the growth investors are paying), the high exercise price isn’t attractive for hiring new employees especially if they are concerned about having to &lt;a href=&quot;https://employeestockoptions.com/exercise-loan/&quot;&gt;leave and pay the high exercise price&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep the shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, in many high valued startups where there are hungry investors, the founders get to sell parts of their vested shares at each round of funding. (At times this opportunity is offered to all employees in a “secondary” offering.) A “secondary” usually (though not always) &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@rizstanford/secondary-sales-in-vc-backed-startups-a-quick-primer-for-entrepreneurs-bdc25ea7f39a&quot;&gt;happens when the startup has achieved significant revenue or traction&lt;/a&gt; and is seen as a “leader” in their market space, on the way to an IPO or a major sale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The End of the High-Commitment/High-Performance Work System?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the academic literature, the work environment of a startup is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nscpolteksby.ac.id/ebook/files/Ebook/Business%20Administration/ARMSTRONGS%20HANDBOOK%20OF%20HUMAN%20RESOURCE%20MANAGEMENT%20PRACTICE/13%20-%20High-perfomance%20Work%20Systems.pdf&quot;&gt;high-commitment/ high-performance work system&lt;/a&gt;. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://libjournals.mtsu.edu/index.php/jsbs/article/view/611/658&quot;&gt;a bundle of Human Resources startup practices&lt;/a&gt; that include hiring, self-managing teams, rapid and decentralized decision-making, on-boarding, flexible work assignments, communication, &lt;em&gt;and stock options&lt;/em&gt;. And there is evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1098&amp;amp;context=workingpapers&quot;&gt;stock options increase the success of startups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful startups need highly committed employees who believe in the goals and values of the company. In exchange for sharing in the potential upside—and being valued as a critical part of the team, they’re willing to rise to the expectation of putting work and the company in front of everything else. But this level of commitment depends on whether &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/140215.pdf&quot;&gt;employees perceive these practices to be fair&lt;/a&gt;, both in terms of the process and the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VCs have intentionally changed the ~50-year-old social contract with startup employees. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;they may have removed one of the key incentives that made startups different from working in a large company&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While unique technology or market insight is one component of a successful startup everyone agrees that attracting &lt;u&gt;and retaining&lt;/u&gt; A+ talent differentiates the winners from the losers. In trying to keep companies private longer, but not pass any of that new value to the employees, the VC’s may have killed the golden goose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should Employees Do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the past the founders and employees were aligned with the same type of common stock grant, and it was the VCs who got preferential stock treatment. Today, if you’re an employee you’re now are at the bottom of the stock preference pile. The founders have preferential stock treatment and the VC have preferred stock. And you’re working just as hard. Add to that all the other known negatives of a startups– no work-life balance, insane hours, inexperienced management, risk of going out of business, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, joining a startup still has a lot of benefits for employees who are looking to work with high performance teams with little structure. Your impact likely be felt. Constant learning opportunities, responsibility and advancement are there for those who take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of the early senior hires, there’s no downside of asking for the same Restricted Stock Agreements (RSAs) as the founders. And if you’re joining a larger startup, you may want to consider those who are offering restricted stock units (RSUs) rather than common stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Should Investors Do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One possibility is to replace early employee (first ~10 employees) stock options with the same Restricted Stock Agreements (RSAs) as the founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For later employees make sure the company offers “refresh” option grants to longer-tenured employees. Better yet, offer restricted stock units (RSUs). Restricted Stock Units are a company’s promise to give you shares of the company’s stock. Unlike a stock option, which always has a strike (purchase) price higher than $0, an RSU is an option with a $0 purchase price. The lower the strike price, the less you have to pay to own a share of company stock&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Like stock options, RSU’s vest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to keep employees engaged, they ought to be allowed buy their vested RSU stock and sell it every time the company raises a new round of funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venture Capital structures were set up for a world in which successful companies exited in 6-8 years and didn’t raise too much capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venture capital growth funds are now giving startups the cash they would have received at an IPO
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Growth Capital” moved the need for an IPO out another five years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allows VCs to capture the increase in market cap in the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may have removed the incentive for non-founders to want to work in a startup versus a large company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As stock options with four-year vesting are no longer a good deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors and Founders have changed the model to their advantage, but no one has changed the model for early employees
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;VCs need to consider a new stock incentive model – RSA’s for the first key hires and then RSU’s – Restricted Stock Units for everyone else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large companies now have an opportunity to attract some of the talent that previously went elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Tesla Model 3 becomes best-selling car in Switzerland</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Tesla Model 3 became the best-selling car in Switzerland last month – beating not just other electric vehicles, but all passenger vehicles period.&lt;span id=&quot;more-89235&quot;/&gt; &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle author_ad&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-4655152367470280&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5555766060&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, Model 3 has become the best-selling electric car in virtually all markets it has been introduced in, but it is also starting to become the best-selling car period in some markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like in Norway, but electric vehicles are always topping the charts in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tesla is also dominating the market in Switzerland with the introduction of the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;notranslate&quot;&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzz.ch/mobilitaet/auto-mobil/tesla-model-3-bestverkauftes-auto-in-der-schweiz-ld.1473810&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;registration data&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla delivered 1,094 Model 3 vehicles in Switzerland in March – beating the long-standing bestsellers Skoda Octavia (801) and the VW Golf (546).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Model 3 has helped Tesla already push its 2019 delivery numbers past its full-year 2018 delivery results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland has long been an important market for Tesla. The automaker has often delivered more vehicles in the small market than in the much bigger neighboring German market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tesla &lt;a class=&quot;gs-title&quot; href=&quot;https://electrek.co/2016/01/14/tesla-model-s-best-selling-switzerland/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-cturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://electrek.co/2016/01/14/tesla-model-s-best-selling-switzerland/&amp;amp;sa=U&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ2s2-2sPhAhXp7IMKHQ9BCigQFggIMAE&amp;amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;amp;cx=008464549922976904202:3wy4ipwvlno&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1RLH3RoAHHsNb6HVpwW4V0&quot; data-ctorig=&quot;https://electrek.co/2016/01/14/tesla-model-s-best-selling-switzerland/&quot;&gt;Model S was often at the top of the best-selling electric cars in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I like to mention when discussing Tesla’s Model 3 deliveries in Europe, that’s just with the two most expensive versions of the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those numbers should go way up when Tesla introduces some less expensive versions of the vehicle later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if Model 3 is in the top 5 of the bestselling vehicles in the most important auto markets in Europe several months later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it will be consistent due to Tesla’s cyclical production and deliveries in Europe, but the numbers should still be extremely impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Amazon countries say giving control of the domain to the tech giant could impact on their sovereignty
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Online retail giant Amazon and the governments of eight South American countries have been given a final deadline to reach an agreement over how to use the &quot;.amazon&quot; web address extension after a seven-year dispute. What will happen next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a name that evokes epic proportions: the world's largest rainforest; a global tech company; and now a diplomatic saga nearing its end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the battle of the Amazon and it starts back in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the body that polices the world wide web's address system, decided to expand its list of generic top-level domains (gTLD) - the bit that comes after the dot in a web address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules allowed companies to apply for brand new extensions, offering internet users and businesses more ways to personalise their website name and addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eight countries containing the Amazon rainforest objected to the retail giant's plans concerning the new .amazon domain name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The case is pitting Amazon rainforest countries against the US tech giant
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governments of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela - all members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) - say that relinquishing the domain exclusively to Amazon could impact on matters of their sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diplomats have told the BBC that they are not seeking to deny Amazon use of the domain but are proposing a &quot;shared governance&quot; of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to their proposals, Amazon would be immediately allowed to use the domains which are relevant to its commercial interests, such as &quot;books.amazon&quot; or &quot;kindle.amazon&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each country in turn would be entitled to use domains which relate to their cultural heritage - imagine Amazon nations coming together to promote the region under the &quot;tourism.amazon&quot; domain, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the countries want to establish a committee in which both Amazon and the eight countries would have the opportunity to object to new top-level domains in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Amazon has rejected these proposals, instead suggesting that the .amazon extension be used in conjunction with two letters representing each country - br.amazon for Brazil, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Users can now end their website names with more than 1,200 new extensions, including .blog and .you
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has declined to comment ahead of the 7 April deadline, but pointed to previous remarks by its vice-president of public policy, Brian Huseman, who vowed that Amazon &quot;will not use the TLDs in a confusing manner&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon has promised to work with governments to identify and block the use of &quot;names that touch national sensitivities&quot; and has pledged to support a new top-level domain using local terms such as .amazonia and .amazonas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And last year it tried to persuade the countries by promising them $5m (£3.8m) worth of free Kindle e-readers and hosting services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They turned down the offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent to ICANN in March, the Ecuadorian Ambassador to the US, Francisco Carrión, said: &quot;We are not looking for financial compensation. Nor are we after ex-gratia concessions to use one or a few second-level domains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is a matter of sovereignty for many of us, and the offer to share the TLDs with the company Amazon Inc. is already a compromise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Other contentious cases of geographical TLDs include .patagonia and .africa
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current dispute follows similar cases already settled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, for example, the US-based outdoor clothing brand Patagonia withdrew an application for the .patagonia extension after objection from Argentina and Chile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mexico-based company had to reach a financial agreement with the town of Bar, Montenegro, in order to obtain consent to register the .bar extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in 2016, ICANN granted the registry of the .africa gTLD to a charity based in Johannesburg, South Africa, after it received support from three quarters of African Union countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Amazon saga has been quite unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bbc.in/2EWgS6u&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;More Technology of Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon's application was initially deferred, but Brazilian and Peruvian diplomats managed to overturn it by securing the support of the group that represents governments within ICANN - the GAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That in itself required diplomatic pressure to change the US position from supporting Amazon Inc. to remaining neutral in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Amazon appealed and a review panel ordered ICANN to make a decision by reaching its own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the parties don't reach a consensus by 7 April, Amazon will have two weeks to argue its case again before ICANN makes up its mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    ICANN is under pressure to resist the push of governments concerning geographic domain names
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is prompting questions about the independence of ICANN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon's Brian Huseman told ICANN that &quot;globally, hundreds (if not thousands) of brands have names similar to regions, land formations, mountains, towns, cities, and other geographic places&quot;. These could be put off applying for new gTLDs because of &quot;uncertainty&quot; over ICANN policy over geographic names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US-based body is under pressure to resist the push of governments and some believe it might be more open to arguments coming from the business sector this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Daniel Sepulveda, who served as a US Ambassador, deputy assistant secretary of state, and co-ordinator for communications and information policy from 2013 to 2017, says: &quot;The ICANN community would make a mistake if it diminishes Brazil's concerns or engages in aggressive libertarian rhetoric&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes ICANN needs to strike a fine balance between the interests and freedoms of businesses, organisations and individuals using the internet, without alienating anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a sensitive situation that requires diplomacy, the exercise of mutual respect, and creative mechanisms for ensuring all sides feel fairly treated,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if Amazon and the eight nations don't reach agreement before the deadline, ICANN has a very difficult decision to make - one that might end up pleasing no-one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matthew_wall&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MatthewWallBBC/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reasons to turn down the transmit power of your Wi-Fi (2017)</title>
<link>https://metis.fi/en/2017/10/txpower/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://metis.fi/en/2017/10/txpower/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It even makes sense to start with minimum power and increase it until the necessary area is covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;0. Wi-Fi is about sharing, not competing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a congested environment it doesn’t matter if your access point is stronger than the neighbor’s. If your AP can receive other APs it will share the air time with them. All APs on the same channel will give other APs equal access to the spectrum. This is how 802.11 was written.&lt;br/&gt;[Edit: I added this point as an afterthought, since this isn’t obvious to many users.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Full power doesn’t increase coverage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile devices like phones and tablets have very limited batteries. To minimise power consumption their radios typically max at 15mW (12dBm), while access points max at 100mW (20dBm) on 2.4GHz and 200mW (23dBm) on 5GHz. However, WiFi connection is always bidirectional. It does no good if the client can receive the AP if the AP can’t receive the client. Have you ever been unable to connect – even though you appear to have good signal? This is the reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bidirectional connection is symmetrical. It doesn’t matter if the AP has a better antenna or is located higher up. The antennas and amplifiers work symmetrically in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Roaming&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WiFi the client devices decide which access point they want to associate with and when to switch to next. (This is contrary to the mobile telephone network, where access points decide which one will serve which client.) Many devices are very reluctant to roam to another AP. They hold on to the first chosen one even when there is a much stronger AP next to the device. Only when the connection breaks will they associate with the next AP – and keep that connection to the end. This results in clients using far away access points with poor connections. By lowering the transmit power the connection will break sooner and the client will roam to a better access point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behaviour affects access point utilisation as well. In the worst scenario the access point by the entrance covers the entire office just barely. When users arrive their devices will associate with the entrance AP and keep using it for the rest of the day. The entrance AP is overloaded while other APs are idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Battery life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The access point informs the clients what its transmit power is (802.11h TPC, 802.11k TPC or Cisco DTPC). Mobile devices will adjust their transmit power level to match to save battery. The logic is that if the mobile device can receive the AP at that power level, the same applies in reverse as the symmetry was explained earlier. By setting the AP transmit power to 5mW (7dBm) for example, you can increase the battery life of the clients. Such a weak signal won’t penetrate walls, so you need more access points – see the next section &lt;em&gt;Performance…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then access points were expensive and they were placed far apart. Now the price is no longer an issue, but WiFi performance is. By adding more access points there will be less clients per AP, hence more bandwidth per client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that wires are always more efficient than radio waves. The faster and closer you can transfer the data from radio to wires the better. That’s why increasing the number of low-powered access points is the key to a high performance WiFi network. Why low-power? See the next section &lt;em&gt;Interference…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Interference&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful signal will interfere with neighbouring devices even if they are on different channels (frequencies). At high signal levels the whole device will act as an antenna and induction will cause superfluous signals in the circuits. This is why you need to keep access points at least 10′ (3m) apart or have a thick concrete wall in-between, preferably both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access points can still interfere with each other, even if there is enough distance. The WiFi channels are not absolute. While the transmission is on a certain channel, the signal bleeds to the neighbouring channels as well, albeit weaker. At high transmit power this weak signal will be strong enough to interfere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Distortion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you drive an amplifier at full power the output will distort. This is easy to test with a car radio: turn it on full blast and try to make sense of the lyrics. A distorted signal is hard to decode and in WiFi parlance this means transmission errors and retransmissions, which will slow down the network. You can increase performance by lowering the transmit power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Neighbourliness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong signal will cause interference in a large area. Even though the extra milliwatts won’t benefit us, they will consume limited air time and interfere with all other WiFi networks in the area (look back at point 0 at the beginning of the article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it security wise as well: Why should anyone across the street be able to receive your WiFi signal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Longer lifetime&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower transmit power equals lower energy consumption equals less heat. Operating at lower temperature increases equipment lifetime. While access points are inexpensive, they tend to break at the most inconvenient time and place. You won’t notice the energy savings on your electricity bill, though.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>8 reasons to turn down the transmit power of your Wi-Fi - Metis.fi</og:title>
<og:description>By default almost all WiFi access points transmit at full power (100mW on 2.4GHz). This gives maximum coverage and users see a good signal (&quot;full bars&quot;). However, there are good reasons to turn down the transmit power to a fraction of the maximum.</og:description>

<title>The Dutch East India Co was richer than Apple, Google, Facebook combined (2017)</title>
<link>https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/how-rich-was-the-dutch-east-india-company</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/how-rich-was-the-dutch-east-india-company</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how rich was the Dutch East India Company? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering what paid for all those nice canals and houses in Amsterdam, Leiden and Utrecht. Well, this image might explain it all a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visualcapitalist.com/most-valuable-companies-all-time/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2oqz471sa19h3vbwa53m33yj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dutchtradingcompare.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Feel free to dive right into the things with us – it certainly wasn’t great for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dutch East-India Company – Apple Didn’t Have Nothing On It!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie” (VOC), better known as the Dutch East-India company was set up in 1602, head-quartered in the “Oost-Indisch Huis” (East-India House) in downtown Amsterdam – which still stands today. It was founded as a private merchant company that was granted a two decade long monopoly by the government for spice trading in Asia, in particular the Dutch East-Indies, known today as the Republic of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you think Amazon is thrifty with deliveries – the VOC sent over one million voyagers across Asia, which is more than the rest of Europe combined, in a time where a trip from Amsterdam to Batavia (Djakarta) would last no shorter than 8 to 10 months and many ships, or individual passengers, would never return. Many of the massive sailing ships perished in storms, fell prey to piracy or infectious disease. Traveling at the time came at a huge risk, but once on location and with the right knowledge and attitude there was a great chance of becoming wealthy and so many took the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was also the first official company to issue stocks, which peaked during the Dutch “Tulip Mania”, a craze for tulip bulbs that is seen as the world’s first true financial bubble. The VOC’s stocks pushed the company’s worth to a massive 78 million Dutch guilders, which is a pretty solid business even today, but translates to a whopping $7,9 trillion dollar worth today… Yes, really, trillion. That’s 7,900 billion – or 79,000 million!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dutch are doing pretty good in modern times as well, different reasons why of course – Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8h9LBNe6bxE_DkQfBooB2g&quot;&gt;our youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; for more videos like this:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modern-day Companies Don’t Even Compare! (And That’s a Good Thing!)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At it’speak the VOC was worth the equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, ExxonMobil, Berkshire Hathaway, Tencent, and Wells Fargo put together! This means that the world’s most valuable company, Apple, is worth about 11% of the peak value of the VOC. Eat that, Steve Jobs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-21296&quot; src=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/rich-Dutch-East-India-Company-1024x768.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also worth, roughly, the same amount as the GDP’s of Japan and Germany of today added together. Can you dig it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also employed 70,000(!) people across the globe, making it a textbook multinational by definition, and this was nearly four centuries ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

(We’re on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/dutchreview/&quot;&gt; Instagram&lt;/a&gt; too!)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Dutch East India Company was also pretty evil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;55.143865150921&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wasn’t all fun and games with the Dutch East India Company – despite bringing the Netherlands prosperity and successfully connecting the world it also brought horrendous suffering for an endless number of people. For two centuries long the VOC did whatever it had to make sure its assets were protected and profit was high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That included &lt;a href=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/dutch-slavery-our-dark-past/&quot;&gt;slave trading,&lt;/a&gt; colonial oppression and absurd mistreatment of employees – if you think your job is tough today, try being a deckhand on a year and a half VOC-round trip or, even much worse, a slave living in semi-dark in the belly of the ship!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VOC is thought to have transported, or rather ‘displaced’, as many as 50,000 people from Africa to serve or trade as slaves in its colonies. It’s a staggering number, worse however is that many countries subjected even more people to slavery per individual nation than the Dutch and VOC ever managed to, creating a permanent “involuntary” change in demographics around the globe. The success of international trading companies like the VOC has forever put a stain on Europe’s colonial past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-21320 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2017-12-12-at-11.18.29-1024x571.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;571&quot;/&gt;Crazy rich – Source: Visual Capitalist
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of its endless exploitation these trading companies, and colonies, have shaped the world and are at the foot of today’s ‘multiculturalism’ and the modern-day economy. Still many people are in denial about their country’s colonial past, Holland for one definitely gained its historic wealth and fortune over the heads of others, which is not to say that it’s the fault of the modern Dutchman – it’s hard to blame someone for something they never had a hand in. But denial or downplaying is flat out ignorant and inexcusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s always wise to speak with some discretion to people of color, even in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dutchreview.com/culture/history/all-turks-back-to-morocco-a-guide-to-the-traditional-migrants-in-the-netherlands/&quot;&gt;‘multi-culti’ Holland&lt;/a&gt;, as the Indo- and Moluccan people are direct descendants of the VOC-days and black Surinam and Antillean-people are African slave descendants, their Hindu-counterparts having been ‘contract laborers’ from the Indian-subcontinent which was hardly better than being a slave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, we hope you enjoyed this piece about the Dutch East India Company – and maybe sparked some curiosity about the Dutch trading spirit and their adventurous outset on becoming a world leader, but it would be irresponsible for us not to have mentioned the downsides that came with it. That much in the least is what every Dutchman owes the world, especially given that people of a colonial past are of such vital importance to modern Holland as we know it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Org-Mode Is One of the Most Reasonable Markup Languages to Use for Text (2018)</title>
<link>https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Update 2017-09-25: Simplified the table syntax even more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update 2018-04-06: Comments on the standardization argument&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is a very nerdy blog entry. It is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language&quot;&gt;lightweight markup languages&lt;/a&gt; and why I think that Org-mode is the best lightweight markup language for many use-cases. And with lightweight markup language, I do mean the syntax, the way you express headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do note that this is not about Emacs. This is about Org-mode syntax and its advantages even when used outside of Emacs. You can type Org-mode in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad&quot;&gt;notepad.exe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt;, and all other text editors out there. And in my opinion it does have advantages compared to the other, common lightweight markup standards such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc&quot;&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing&quot;&gt;Wikitext&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText&quot;&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Org-mode is my favorite syntax. Despite my personal choice you will see that I've got some pretty convincing arguments that underline my statement as well. So this is not just a matter of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a grin on your face because you don't have any clue what this is all about: keep on reading. It makes an excellent example for making fun of nerds at your next dinner party. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Is Intuitive, Easy to Learn and Remember&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you are. This is almost anything you need to know about Org-mode syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 * This Is A Heading
 ** This Is A Sub-Heading
 *** And A Sub-Sub-Heading

 Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.

 *bold* /italic/ _underlined_ +strikethrough+ =monospaced=
 [[http://Karl-Voit.at][Link description]]
 http://Karl-Voit.at → link without description

 : Simple pre-formatted text such as for source code.
 : This also respects the line breaks. *bold* is not bold here.

 - list item
 - another item
   - sub-item
     1. also enumerated
     2. if you like
 - [ ] yet to be done
 - [X] item which is done         
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen many coworkers who typed Org-mode markup when taking notes in their text editor. And they did not even know anything about it. So it is that intuitive I'd say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was learning Org-mode, I did not even use a cheat-sheet for the syntax as I normally do. It was very natural for me to type Org-mode right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables are a bit more complicated like in all other markup languages I know of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 | My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          42 | foo         | bar         |
 |          23 | baz         | abcdefg     |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          65 |             |             |      
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You most probably won't type a table like this outside of Emacs. The manual alignment without tool-support is very tedious. But even here you are able to deliver a perfectly fine Org-mode table by simply ignoring the alignment altogether:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 | My Column 1|My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-
 | 42 | foo | bar|
 | 23 | baz | abcdefg|
 |-
 | 65 |||         
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Is Standardized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an almost ridiculous argument because in my opinion a markup is of no use when it is not the same for tool A as for tool B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are markup languages that are different. For example the very widely used markup language named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; has many flavors to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; lists six different Markdown flavors as output formats. This is an absolutely bad situation which foils the original idea behind lightweight markup languages. When some web service tells me that I can use &quot;Markdown&quot; for a text field, I have to dig deeper to find out which of those many different Markdown standards the web page is talking about. After this I will have to continue and look for a cheat-sheet of this dialect because nothing is more difficult to differentiate than multiple standards that are almost the same but not really the same. A usability hell. I get furious every time I have to enter this hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Org-mode, life is easy. The snippet from the previous section explains all there is. Any tool that interprets Org-mode accepts this simple and easy to remember syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Is Consistent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many lightweight markup languages do offer multiple ways of typing headings. There are basically three ways of defining headings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prefix headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre- and postfix headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underlined headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples for each category:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 Prefix headings:

 # Heading 1
 ## Heading 2
 ### Heading 3

 Pre- and postfix headings:

 = Heading 1 =
 == Heading 2 ==
 === Heading 3 ===

 Underlined headings:

 Heading 1
 =========

 Heading 2
 ~~~~~~~~~

 Heading 3
 *********        
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the prefix heading style. Org-mode use this as well with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; as prefix characters. The more asterisks, the deeper the level of the heading is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre- and postfix headings&lt;/strong&gt; do offer bad usability. The user has manually synchronize the number of prefix character with the number of postfix characters. And it is totally unclear how something like &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; heading == with different numbers of pre/postfix characters is going to turn out when being interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case the user already used a markup language with simple prefix headings, it is not logical why there is the need for the postfix characters at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse than this is the &lt;strong&gt;underlined heading category&lt;/strong&gt;. The user is completely irritated for multiple reasons. Besides the tedious manual work to align the stupid heading characters with the heading title, it is not clear what characters must be used for those heading lines. If you've got a bigger document with different levels of headings you get confused which heading character stands for which heading level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the tilde characters level one? Or was it the equals characters? And how about asterisks? Without a cheat-sheet, the occasional markup user is completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gets even more worse: some markup languages let you choose your &quot;order&quot; of heading characters. This results in weird situations. For example one author is starting to write a reStructuredText document using her favorite heading syntax. A second author is joining in and has to analyze the document in order to know what heading syntax he must use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html&quot;&gt;reStructuredText mode of Emacs&lt;/a&gt; you can find following function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visualize the hierarchy of the section adornments in the current buffer by invoking &lt;code&gt;rst-display-adornments-hierarchy&lt;/code&gt;, bound on &lt;code&gt;C-c C-a C-d&lt;/code&gt;. A temporary buffer will appear with fake section titles rendered in the style of the current document. This can be useful when editing other people's documents to find out which section adornments correspond to which levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you got it right, it is true: this function's only purpose is to generate a dummy-hierarchy of headings to visualize which markup has to be used for heading 1, which one for heading 2 and so forth just for this single document. What a bad design decision of the markup when you need such hacks just to know how a heading should look like in a markup even if you are familiar with in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one more: some markup languages even allow &lt;strong&gt;mixed heading styles&lt;/strong&gt;. You can use an underlined heading style for heading level 1, a prefix style for level 2, another underlining style for level 3 and so forth. Now the chaos is a perfect one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at a different markup element: &lt;strong&gt;external links&lt;/strong&gt;. As you already remember in Org-mode, a link looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 [[http://Karl-Voit.at][my home page]]     
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difficult thing here is to remember that the URL is at the beginning and the description follows after the URL. Many markup languages do add additional and unnecessary levels of difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language#Link_syntax&quot;&gt;examples from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and comments by me where a user might be irritated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AsciiDoc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 http://example.com[Text]          
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form is simple but for complex URLs, the &lt;code&gt;[Text]&lt;/code&gt; might look like being part of the URL itself. Not beautiful but at least something I could live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 [Text](http://example.com)
 [Text](http://example.com &quot;Title&quot;)       
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brackets or parentheses first? Why using different kind of markup characters in the first place like only brackets? Is the &lt;code&gt;Title&lt;/code&gt; part of the URL? Why not part of &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;? Very confusing design decisions from my point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reStructuredText:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 `Text &amp;lt;http://example.com/&amp;gt;`_       
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy moly. This is some weird stuff. First, you have to grave accents &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt; and not apostrophes &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;. Then what about the underscore character at the end? This is as complicated as you can define a simple URL. I'd even prefer the hard to type HTML version of linking. A disaster for something which has &quot;lightweight&quot; in its class name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Can Be Easily Typed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple syntax of Org-mode does not imply typing unnecessary characters. You don't have to manually align something like underlined headings. Anybody using a simple text editor is very fast at adding markup for headings, font variations, and so forth. The previous section proved that other markup languages clearly fail in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Makes Sense Outside of Emacs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to use the Emacs editor to write and work with Org-mode markup text. As I mentioned above, many people already do so just because Org-mode is an intuitive and clean way of typing text characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you've got text information in Org-mode markup, you can process it with many tools. Most prominent and most important examples are files pushed within a GitHub repository and the swiss army knife named &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandoc.org/&quot;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; which is able to convert Org-mode to dozens of formats like HTML, odt (LibreOffice), docx (Word), LaTeX, PDF, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Org-Mode Has Excellent Tool Support (If You Want)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the beginning, this is not an article about Emacs. Nevertheless for anybody not familiar with Emacs I have to mention that with Emacs there is a tool that supports (not only) in writing Org-mode syntax in a perfect way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might start with mouse-only usage. There are menu items with all important functions. For the users that want to get a minimum of efficiency, the menu items show you &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf&quot;&gt;the keyboard shortcuts you might want to use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Org-mode it is really easy to learn. Basically you just have to use &lt;code&gt;TAB&lt;/code&gt; for toggle the collapsing and expanding of headings, lists, and blocks. It's &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; and the arrow keys to move around headings, list items, and even table columns/rows. &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-Return&lt;/code&gt; creates a new heading or list item without the need of entering the markup characters and manually matching indentation levels at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. With those three things you're good to write Org-mode syntax efficiently. The basic file open/save, finding help, exiting Emacs stuff is accessible with icons or the menu. No need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf&quot;&gt;learn more keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a&gt; if you don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having experienced this great tool-support, users typically are eager to learn more. You don't have to. You might be happy with Org-mode for capturing minutes of meetings and your shopping list. However, others do master a few additional things and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vikasrawal/endingmalnutrition&quot;&gt;write whole eBooks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5313&quot;&gt;within Org-mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightweight markup languages are designed to be used with a minimum effort compared to full-blown and therefore more complicated markup languages such as HTML or LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are doing their job better than others. In my experience, many design decisions of widely adapted markups such as Markdown or reStructuredText (and others) are questionable from a usability point of view. At least I do have some issues when I have to use them in my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I hardly see any people out there using Org-mode as a markup language outside of Emacs although there are very good reasons for it as an easy to learn and easy to use markup language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this blog article I wanted to point out the usefulness of Org-mode even when you are not using Emacs as an writing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backlinks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-title&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/8690ex/as_a_markup_language_forgetting_about_todogtd/dwvl3d4/&quot;&gt;&quot;revocation&quot; has a valid point related to the missing standardization of Org-mode&lt;/a&gt;. Here is my comment on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statements here refer to a /lightweight/ markup, the basic things of Org-mode syntax. I explicitly listed &quot;headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do not cover here is a full syntax statement or standard. In my opinion, currently this is not possible outside of Emacs for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/8690ex/as_a_markup_language_forgetting_about_todogtd/dwizwjs/&quot;&gt;variations in interpreting Org-mode files between Emacs and pandoc&lt;/a&gt;. Also, pandoc only supports a sub-set of Org-mode. Otherwise, pandoc would have to re-implement or embed Emacs for parsing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this specific case, pandoc seems to have a more strict parser related to leading spaces for #-lines, or keywords. I'm pretty sure that the pandoc project accepts this issue as a bug. In doubt, the interpretation of Emacs is the definition, or golden-standard, of Org-mode syntax. Even &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html&quot;&gt;this beta-version of a syntax definition&lt;/a&gt; does not mention optional spaces before keywords. &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-syntax.html&quot;&gt;The manual&lt;/a&gt; mentions &lt;code&gt;org-element-parse-buffer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;org-lint&lt;/code&gt; which would be most probably the best choice for defining the official standard if you would search for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this does not relate at all with the intention of this article: the design of the (basic) Org-mode syntax compared to other lightweight markup languages. All the issues mentioned where other markups show inconsistencies and usability issues where Org-mode seems to have advantages still do apply here. Completely independent of the standardization argument. My personal believe is, that if there would be more use of Org-mode syntax elements outside of Emacs, there would be a much higher pressure on formally defining Org-mode as a syntax which pandoc and even Emacs could use as the golden standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, there is not even the necessity of defining this golden standard because nobody outside of the Emacs community knows or even is using Org-mode. And this is what I tried to change a bit because other markup languages do tend to hurt my geeky soul when I do have to use them. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
