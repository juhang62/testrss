<title>Andreessen-Horowitz craps on “AI” startups from a great height</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Andreessen-Horowitz has always been the most levelheaded of the major current year VC firms. While other firms were levering up on “cleantech” and nonsensical biotech startups that violate physical law, they quietly continued to invest in sane companies (also hot garbage bugman products like soylent).  I assume they actually listen to people on the front lines, rather than what their VC pals are telling them. Maybe they’re just smarter than everyone else; definitely more independent minded. Their recent review on how “AI” differs from software company investments is absolutely brutal. I am pretty sure most people didn’t get the point, so I’ll quote it emphasizing the important bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/&quot;&gt;https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use all the buzzwords (my personal &lt;em&gt;bete-noir&lt;/em&gt;; the term “AI” when they mean “machine learning”), but they’ve finally publicly noticed certain things which are abundantly obvious to anyone who works in the field. For example, gross margins are low for deep learning startups that use “cloud” compute. Mostly because they use cloud compute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23.955119214586&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross Margins, Part 1: Cloud infrastructure is a substantial – and sometimes hidden – cost for AI companies&lt;/strong&gt; 🏭&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old days of on-premise software, delivering a product meant stamping out and shipping physical media – the cost of running the software, whether on servers or desktops, was borne by the buyer. Today, with the dominance of SaaS, that cost has been pushed back to the vendor. Most software companies pay big AWS or Azure bills every month – the more demanding the software, the higher the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI, it turns out, is pretty demanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training &lt;/strong&gt;a single AI model can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eturner303/status/1223976313544773634&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;em&gt;compute&lt;/em&gt; resources. While it’s tempting to treat this as a one-time cost, retraining is increasingly recognized as an ongoing cost, since the data that feeds AI models tends to change over time (a phenomenon known as “data drift”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model inference &lt;/strong&gt;(the process of generating predictions in production) is also more computationally complex than operating traditional software. Executing a long series of matrix multiplications just requires more math than, for example, reading from a database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI applications are more likely than traditional software to operate on &lt;strong&gt;rich media &lt;/strong&gt;like images, audio, or video. These types of data consume higher than usual &lt;em&gt;storage &lt;/em&gt;resources, are expensive to process, and often suffer from region of interest issues – an application may need to process a large file to find a small, relevant snippet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ve had AI companies tell us that&lt;strong&gt; cloud operations &lt;/strong&gt;can be more complex and costly than traditional approaches, particularly because there aren’t good tools to scale AI models globally. As a result, some AI companies have to routinely transfer trained models across cloud regions – racking up big ingress and egress costs – to improve reliability, latency, and compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these forces contribute to the 25% or more of revenue that AI companies often spend on cloud resources. In extreme cases, startups tackling particularly complex tasks have actually found manual data processing cheaper than executing a trained model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something which is true of pretty much all machine learning with heavy compute and data problems. The pricing structure of “cloud” bullshit is designed to extract maximum blood from people with heavy data or compute requirements. Cloud companies would prefer to sell the time on a piece of hardware to 5 or 10 customers. If you’re lucky enough to have a startup that runs on a few million rows worth of data and a GBM or Random Forest, it’s probably not true at all, but precious few startups are so lucky. Those who use the latest DL woo on the huge data sets they require will have huge compute bills unless they buy their own hardware. For reasons that make no sense to me, most of them don’t buy hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13.713310580205&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many problem domains, exponentially more processing and data are needed to get incrementally more accuracy. This means – as we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2019/12/17/anyscale/&quot;&gt;noted before&lt;/a&gt; – that model complexity is growing at an incredible rate, and it’s unlikely processors will be able to keep up. Moore’s Law is not enough. (For example, the compute resources required to train state-of-the-art AI models has grown over 300,000x since 2012, while the transistor count of NVIDIA GPUs has grown only ~4x!) Distributed computing is a compelling solution to this problem, but it primarily addresses speed – not cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond what they’re saying about the size of Deep Learning models which is doubtless true for interesting new results, admitting that the computational power of GPU chips hasn’t exactly been growing apace is something rarely heard (though more often lately). Everyone thinks Moore’s law will save us. NVIDIA actually does have obvious performance improvements that could be made, but the scale of things is such that the only way to grow significantly bigger models is by lining up more GPUs. Doing this in a “cloud” you’re renting from a profit making company is financial suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross Margins, Part 2: Many AI applications rely on “humans in the loop” to function at a high level of accuracy 👷&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human-in-the-loop systems take two forms, both of which contribute to lower gross margins for many AI startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: training most of today’s state-of-the-art AI models involves the manual cleaning and labeling of large datasets. This process is laborious, expensive, and among the biggest barriers to more widespread adoption of AI. Plus, as we discussed above, training doesn’t end once a model is deployed. To maintain accuracy, new training data needs to be continually captured, labeled, and fed back into the system. Although techniques like drift detection and active learning can reduce the burden, anecdotal data shows that many companies spend up to 10-15% of revenue on this process – usually not counting core engineering resources – and suggests ongoing development work exceeds typical bug fixes and feature additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: for many tasks, especially those requiring greater cognitive reasoning, humans are often plugged into AI systems in real time. Social media companies, for example, employ thousands of human reviewers to augment AI-based moderation systems. Many autonomous vehicle systems include remote human operators, and most AI-based medical devices interface with physicians as joint decision makers. More and more startups are adopting this approach as the capabilities of modern AI systems are becoming better understood. A number of AI companies that planned to sell pure software products are increasingly bringing a services capability in-house and booking the associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the business knows about this. If you’re working with interesting models, even assuming the presence of infinite accurately labeled training data, the “human in the loop” problem doesn’t ever completely go away. A machine learning model is generally “man amplified.” If you need someone (or, more likely, several someone’s) making a half million bucks a year to keep your neural net producing reasonable results, you might reconsider your choices. If the thing makes human level decisions a few hundred times a year, it might be easier and cheaper for humans to make those decisions manually, using a better user interface. Better user interfaces are sorely underappreciated. Have a look at Labview, Delphi or Palantir’s offerings for examples of highly productive user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Since the range of possible input values is so large, each new customer deployment is likely to generate data that has never been seen before. Even customers that appear similar – two auto manufacturers doing defect detection, for example – may require substantially different training data, due to something as simple as the placement of video cameras on their assembly lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software which solves a business problem generally scales to new customers. You do some database back end grunt work, plug it in, and you’re done.  Sometimes you have to adjust processes to fit the accepted uses of the software; or spend absurd amounts of labor adjusting the software to work with your business processes: SAP is notorious for this. Such cycles are hugely time and labor consuming. Obviously they must be worth it at least some of the time. But while SAP is notorious (to the point of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerworld.com/article/2530405/sap-project-costs-cited-in-jeweler-s-bankruptcy-filing.html&quot;&gt;causing bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in otherwise healthy companies), most people haven’t figured out that ML oriented processes almost never scale like a simpler application would. You will be confronted with the same problem as using SAP; there is a ton of work done up front; all of it custom. I’ll go out on a limb and assert that most of the up front data pipelining and organizational changes which allow for it are probably more valuable than the actual machine learning piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the AI world, technical differentiation is harder to achieve. New model architectures are being developed mostly in open, academic settings. Reference implementations (pre-trained models) are available from open-source libraries, and model parameters can be optimized automatically. Data is the core of an AI system, but it’s often owned by customers, in the public domain, or over time becomes a commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right; that’s why a lone wolf like me, or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.win-vector.com/site/&quot;&gt;small team&lt;/a&gt; can do as good or better a job than some firm with 100x the head count and 100m in VC backing. I know what the strengths and weaknesses of the latest woo is. Worse than that: I know that, from a business perspective, something dumb like Naive Bayes or a linear model might solve the customer’s problem just as well as the latest gigawatt neural net atrocity. The VC backed startup might be betting on their “special tool” as its moaty IP. A few percent difference on a ROC curve won’t matter if the data is hand wavey and not really labeled properly, which describes most data you’ll encounter in the wild. ML is undeniably useful, but it is extremely rare that a startup have “special sauce” that works 10x or 100x better than somthing you could fork in a git repo. People won’t pay a premium over in-house ad-hoc data science solutions unless it represents &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;truly game changing results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The technology could impress the shit out of everyone else, but if it’s only getting 5% better MAPE (or whatever); it’s irrelevant. A lot of “AI” doesn’t really work better than a histogram via “group by” query. Throwing complexity at it won’t make it better: sometimes there’s no data in your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some good bullet points for would be “AI” technologists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;model complexity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve seen a massive difference in COGS between startups that train a unique model per customer versus those that are able to share a single model (or set of models) among all customers….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to be able to do, but super rare. If you’ve found a problem like this, you better hope you have a special, moaty solution, or a unique data set which makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose problem domains carefully – and often narrowly – to reduce &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;data complexity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Automating human labor is a fundamentally hard thing to do. Many companies are finding that the minimum viable task for AI models is narrower than they expected.  Rather than offering general text suggestions, for instance, some teams have found success offering short suggestions in email or job postings. Companies working in the CRM space have found highly valuable niches for AI based just around updating records. There is a large class of problems, like these, that are hard for humans to perform but relatively easy for AI. They tend to involve high-scale, low-complexity tasks, such as moderation, data entry/coding, transcription, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge admission of “AI” failure. All the sugar plum fairy bullshit about “AI replacing jobs” evaporates in the puff of pixie dust it always was. Really, they’re talking about cheap overseas labor when lizard man fixers like Yang regurgitate the “AI coming for your jobs” meme; AI actually stands for “Alien (or) Immigrant” in this context. Yes they do hold out the possibility of ML being used in some limited domains; I agree, but the hockey stick required for VC backing, and the army of Ph.D.s required to make it work doesn’t really mix well with those limited domains, which have a limited market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace services.&lt;/strong&gt; There are huge opportunities to meet the market where it stands. That may mean offering a full-stack translation service rather than translation software or running a taxi service rather than selling self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words; you probably can’t build a brain in a can that can solve all kinds of problems: you’re probably going to be a consulting and services company. In case you aren’t familiar with valuations math: services companies are worth something like 2x yearly revenue; where software and “technology” companies are worth 10-20x revenue. That’s why the wework weasel kept trying to position his pyramid scheme as a software company. The implications here are huge: “AI” raises done by A16z and people who think like them are going to be at much lower valuations. If it weren’t clear enough by now, they said it again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize: most AI systems today aren’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; software, in the traditional sense. And AI businesses, as a result, don’t look exactly like software businesses. They involve ongoing human support and material variable costs. They often don’t scale quite as easily as we’d like. And strong defensibility – critical to the “build once / sell many times” software model – doesn’t seem to come for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These traits make AI feel, to an extent, like a services business. Put another way: you can replace the services firm, but you can’t (completely) replace the services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll say it again since they did: services companies are not valued like software businesses are. VCs love software businesses; work hard up front to solve a problem, print money forever. That’s why they get the 10-20x revenues valuations. Services companies? Why would you invest in a services company? Their growth is inherently constrained by labor costs and weird addressable market issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t exactly an announcement of a new “AI winter,” but it’s autumn and &lt;em&gt;the winter is coming&lt;/em&gt; for startups who claim to be offering world beating “AI” solutions. The promise of “AI” has always been to replace human labor and increase human power over nature. People who actually think ML is “AI” think the machine will just teach itself somehow; no humans needed. Yet, that’s not the financial or physical reality. The reality is, there are interesting models which can be applied to business problems by armies of well trained DBAs, data engineers, statisticians and technicians. These sorts of things are often best grown inside a large existing company to increase productivity. If the company is sclerotic, it can hire outside consultants, just as they’ve always done. A16z’s portfolio reflects this. Putting aside their autonomous vehicle bets (which look like they don’t have a large “AI” component to them), and some health tech bets that have at least linear regression tier data science, I can only identify only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shield.ai/products-all&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; overtly data &lt;a href=&quot;https://sigopt.com/solution/&quot;&gt;science related&lt;/a&gt; startup they’ve funded. They’re vastly more long crypto currency and blockchain than “AI.” Despite having &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/5/13081058/marc-andreessen-ai-future&quot;&gt;said otherwise&lt;/a&gt;, their money says “AI” companies don’t look so hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My TLDR summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Deep learning costs a lot in compute, for marginal payoffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning startups generally have no moat or meaningful special sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning startups are mostly services businesses, not software businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning will be most productive inside large organizations that have data and process inefficiencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I posted this on HN &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22406277&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and John Graham-Cumming (the CTO of Cloudflare) reached out and said they're looking into the issue internally &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22407232&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;. I'm grateful this is getting addressed. In retrospect, I regret my tone of voice in this post. I think I was too quick to assume bad faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I followed up with a potential client to ask them what they thought of the proposal I sent them the previous Thursday. I was shocked to learn that they thought they had emailed me the same day to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began debugging, and figured out there was an issue with my MX records. The problem: there weren't any. In fact, I had no DNS records at all. I logged in to Cloudflare and was told &quot;You currently don't have any websites&quot; and prompted to add a site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I thought I had been hacked, so I went to the audit log. The only recent event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Date: 2020-02-18T22:52:34-05:00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;User IP Address: 127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;Resource: Zone&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;Audit Record: {{redacted}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;Metadata: { &quot;Zone name&quot;: &quot;danielzfranklin.org&quot; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;user&quot; IP address immediately stood out to me: &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;. At this point I believed this was some sort of bug on Cloudflare's end, so I went to file a support ticket. Before I could file a ticket, Cloudflare required me to search their support base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare &quot;helpfully&quot; pointed me to the relevant help center article: &quot;Why was my domain deleted from Cloudflare?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/221327488?input_string=My+domain&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. From it, I learned that the official way Cloudflare communicates that they have deleted your domain is by placing an event in the audit log with an IP of &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I intentionally set out to build a horrible user experience I'm unsure if I could top this. I naively expected that I would be notified by email before Cloudflare broke everything. In the absence of that, I would expect to see a notice when I logged in. In the absence of that, I would expect to see a field in the audit log mentioning in human language what happened. In the absence of that, if for some arcane reason Cloudflare is unable to change the format of their audit logs, I would at a minimum expect a message on the audit log page that explained what a deletion logged to &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; means. I registered for Cloudflare with a Gmail address specifically so that I could receive notifications from them if there were issues with my email setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the help page their ticketing system pointed me to is completely unhelpful. For some reason I trusted Cloudflare with both my registration and DNS, and every debugging step mentions at the top that &quot;It is not necessary to check domain registration for domains utilizing a Cloudflare CNAME setup.&quot; The help page provides no information on why a domain registered with Cloudflare would be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury I learn that when Cloudflare automatically detects an anomaly with your domain they permanently delete all DNS records. Mine won't be difficult to restore, but I'm not sure why this is necessary. Surely it would be possible for Cloudflare to mark a domain as disabled without irrevocably deleting it? Combined with the hacky audit log, I'm left with the opinion that for some reason Cloudflare decided to completely half-ass the part of their system that is responsible for &lt;em&gt;deleting everything that matters&lt;/em&gt; to a user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Cloudflare deleted my domain registration I can't change the status from &lt;code&gt;clientTransferProhibited&lt;/code&gt; through their dashboard so I don't think I can even leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time thinking about if it was fair for me to post this on the same day as I filed a support ticket with Cloudflare. I ultimately decided to because their ticketing system recommended I post on their community forum instead or in addition to submitting a ticket. The page informed me that because I don't have a business account I would receive much faster support from the &quot;community&quot;. However, I'm unable to log in to their community forum. When I click the login button I'm redirected to my dashboard, and when I then click Support on the dashboard I'm redirected back to the forum without being logged in. I suppose it's possibly an issue with Firefox blocking cookies (although I disabled tracking prevention) so it's possible this part is partly a problem on my end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know what might have caused Cloudflare to delete my domain? Any ideas for how I could transfer my domain away from Cloudflare sooner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Franklin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I gave Cloudflare permission to publicly disclose details &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22407309&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. iudqnolq is my HN username.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/donald-knuth-was-framed/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;YOW! Talk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My YOW! talk, “Designing Distributed Systems with TLA+”, is now available! You can watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATobswwFwQA&amp;amp;utm_source=hillelwayne&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=donald-knuth-was-framed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Donald Knuth Was Framed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I was talking with a friend about structured editing and literate programming came up. LP was one of Donald Knuth’s ideas, to structure programs as readable documents instead of just machine docs. He was interested in it, I was cautiously skeptical. We both knew the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming?utm_source=hillelwayne&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=donald-knuth-was-framed#Critique&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;famous story&lt;/a&gt; about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Jon Bentley asked Knuth to demonstrate the concept of literate programming by writing a program in WEB. Knuth came up with an 8-pages long monolithic listing that was published together with a critique by Douglas McIlroy of Bell Labs. McIlroy praised intricacy of Knuth’s solution, his choice of a data structure (Frank M. Liang’s hash trie), but noted that more practical, much faster to implement, debug and modify solution of the problem takes only six lines of shell script by reusing standard Unix utilities. McIlroy concluded:[12]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knuth has shown us here how to program intelligibly, but not wisely. I buy the discipline. I do not buy the result. He has fashioned a sort of industrial-strength Faberge egg—intricate, wonderfully worked, refined beyond all ordinary desires, a museum piece from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program was “print out the top K most-used words in a text.” The six lines of shell script were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' |
tr A-Z a-z |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -rn |
sed ${1}q
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A damning counter. But neither of us had ever &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the paper. And as you know, I’m all about primary sources. We pulled up the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/don-knuth/pearls-2.pdf?utm_source=hillelwayne&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=donald-knuth-was-framed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and read through it together. And it left us with a very different understanding of literate programming, and the challenge, than the famous story gave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we found that Literate Programming as conceived by Knuth not just “text, code, text, code”. You could say “now we add &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; to section &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;bar&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;” even after having already created &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; and modified it several times before. Writing the code out-of-order is the whole point. You’d use a tool to take the narrative, or “weave” and synthesize the code, the “tangle”. Very roughly, you could write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Blah blah blah

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;bar&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

Blah blah
  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;bar&amp;gt;&amp;gt; = print(&quot;world
Blah
  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;&amp;gt; = print(&quot;hello &quot;);
Blah
  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;bar&amp;gt;&amp;gt; += !&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it would weave that into the actual program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual paper paints LP in a much better light than we thought it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knuth was asked to demonstrate his tool for LP, WEB, and was demonstrating LP as part of that. He wasn’t competing with McIlroy, and didn’t know how McIlroy was going to critique it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual content is effectively his stream-of-consciousness notes about what he’s doing. He discusses why he makes the choices he does and what he’s thinking about as primary concerns. It’s easy to skim or deep-dive the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the “eight pages” aren’t because Knuth is doing LP, but because he’s Donald Knuth:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One page is him setting up the problem (“what do we mean by ‘word’? What if multiple words share the same frequency?”) and one page is just the index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another page is just about working around specific Pascal issues no modern language has, like “how do we read in an integer” and “how do we identify letters when Pascal’s character set is poorly defined.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there’s almost four pages of handrolling a hash trie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knuth is doing everything from first principles. One of McIlroy’s strongest criticisms is “everything there- even input conversion and sorting-is programmed monolithically and from scratch. In particular the isolation of words, the handling of punctuation, and the treatment of case distinctions are built in.” Of course it is! Knuth was trying to show how WEB makes it easier to write and understand programs, not explain how Pascal packages work! His ideas aren’t invalidated just because we can import libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;[rant] McIlroy could only write such a tight script because we’re doing something that’s near &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for shell scripting: simple processing of text. If we choose a slightly different problem, like “find the top K pairs of words and print the Levenshtein distance between each pair” then shell scripting that would be a lot harder.[/rant]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to say that McIlroy is entirely wrong, and he raises a lot of good points. But I don’t think this is the damning indictment of LP or a total vindication of the Unix model. It also got me to look into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://leoeditor.com/?utm_source=hillelwayne&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=donald-knuth-was-framed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leo Editor&lt;/a&gt;, which seems a more modern version of LP. I’ll report on how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google interviewing process for software developer role in 2020</title>
<link>https://habr.com/en/post/489698/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://habr.com/en/post/489698/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/0t/aa/y4/0taay4tsk7dy1jubh0kapu9hafw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Hello! I just finished interviewing with Google and wanted to quickly catch you up on some interesting and frustrating steps of the process so that you can understand what to expect from Google interviews and the steps involved. I will also share some tips on how to prepare for the interview and mistakes to avoid.&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a success story, this is the wrong post for you. I actually failed the interviewing process, but the whole experience was pretty interesting for me and leads me on to another stage of my career. I will share more details on this at the end of the post. All names and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of Google employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Initial screening interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;My story starts on a rainy October morning. I received a message from Olivia, a Google recruiter, with the subject «Interested in solving high-impact engineering problems at Google?». At that moment in time I had recently finished several projects and was looking for new challenges. Working at Google seemed like a good opportunity that I didn’t want to miss, so I quickly responded, «Yes, definitely» and booked an appointment via Google Hangouts.&lt;p&gt;Our chat took place two days later via Hangouts. Olivia told me how exciting it is to work at Google, and what the hiring process looks like. When I asked about the details of the position, she told me that they were looking for someone for their new office in Warsaw, Poland, to support and develop Google Cloud functions for enterprise customers. I asked about the exact responsibilities that would come under my remit, and the team I would be part of, but she said it didn’t matter at that stage – I could select the desired team and position later on when all steps of the interview process were completed. That was frustrating moment #1 for me, but I decided that it was worth persevering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frustrating moment #1.&lt;/strong&gt; What if there was no team at Google that I would like to join?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;From what Olivia told me, the interviewing process at Google comprises three stages: first of all, there are two remote coding interviews on algo and data structures. If you’re extraordinary, you might just have one interview, but for an average software engineer it will be two. The next stage is an on-site interview in one of the Google offices, which includes several coding interviews (again!), a system design interview, and last but not least, ‘Googleyness and Leadership’. The last one detects how well you’ll fit into the company.&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #1.&lt;/strong&gt; The Google interviewing process is difficult and will take up several weeks of your life. You need to go all-in to prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In Olivia’s words, «Even if you pass all the interviews and reach the final stage, it doesn’t guarantee that you will get the job. Because Google’s hiring process has one more step, which will take place without you. In this last stage, several senior Googlers (who don't know you and have never spoken to you) will review your CV and feedback from the interviewers and decide whether you will fit into Google or not. Only with their endorsement can you land the job.» OK, it’s time for frustrating moment #2.&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frustrating moment #2.&lt;/strong&gt; You can pass every interview with A grades and still not get a job, because a senior Googler decides that you're the wrong person to be hired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;After the screening interview I realised how low my chances were and decided that I would go as far as I could only for the sake of experience.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/f6/e4/xu/f6e4xujge7pvwxtdcac6o2d-ttk.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stage 1. Remote coding interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Later on, Olivia booked me a first remote coding interview. In the meantime I went through several algo problems on the geeksforgeeks website and completed its «Must Do Interview Preparation Course». I can’t recommend it, because problems on this course are very abstract and the platform is buggy, but for the first coding challenge it was enough.&lt;p&gt;The call was via Google Hangouts. The interviewer briefly told me a bit about himself and asked me to solve a coding challenge. I can’t tell you the details of the coding challenge (it would be unfair and wouldn’t help you much anyway). The only thing I can share is that it was some sort of greedy algorithm in a chess game environment. I solved the whole problem in 50+ minutes, almost without any hints from the interviewer. The solution includes tests and code on Python. All coding for these types of interviews is usually done in some kind of shared notepad, and in this case it was Google Docs. Frankly, the interviewer himself and the challenge were interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was waiting for the results: had I performed well or not? The results were ready only after a week, and only when I asked the recruiter for an update. This would become a common theme for all the following interviews: the results would be ready only after a week and a message to the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #2.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be shy about asking your recruiter for the results of your last interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Olivia said that the result of my interview was «in the majority positive». The only negative thing was the time that elapsed in solving the problem: it should have been no more than 45 minutes. Olivia therefore asked me to undergo another remote coding interview. At this point I understood that in the eyes of Google I was an average software developer, not an extraordinary one. But that’s OK – I decided to move forward.&lt;p&gt;The second remote interview was a week later, and it was pretty much the same as the first one. The coding problem was simple enough. It was a combinatorial problem and to solve it you had to come up with the math formula and think carefully about all edge cases. The solution took me only 40 minutes and I was super excited to have solved this problem in such a quick and elegant manner. I waited for the final feedback from the recruiter. The next step would be a trip to Poland for an on-site interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a week of waiting, during which time the recruiter didn’t answer my messages. Then Olivia replied that she was on a business trip and would respond to me when she was back in the office. Two weeks after my last interview, I got a voice call from Olivia. She said that my last interview had been «in the majority positive». The only negative thing was that I used a lot of pseudo-code. She also mentioned that I was good at testing (maybe it’s because four years ago I read a «How Google Tests Software» book, who knows?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #3.&lt;/strong&gt; You should cover each and every line of code with tests in the coding interview. Just say it out loud when the interviewer asks you to test your function, and only after that, start writing your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;After such a promising beginning to our talk, she said that they didn’t know what the next steps should be so I should wait for a while. A week later I got a message from Olivia who said that from now my recruiter would be a George, another guy from the London office, and that I needed to pass another two remote coding interviews. I would get all the details from George in due course.&lt;p&gt;I had a call with George later the same day. He said that my coding interviews would be done remotely in a month's time and that I should select a date. He refused to say why these interviews would be remote, but mentioned that these coding challenges would be much harder than previous ones and if I passed them I would be invited for the remaining interviews at their office. I decided that I had already started this process and should see it through to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/v5/bk/fb/v5bkfbjmgxcdtbhybvh5k6e2bty.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stage 2. More remote coding interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;I started preparing for another two interviews. This time I was using HackerRank and its «Interview Preparation Kit». I highly recommend it – it’s really close to what happened at the interview.&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #4.&lt;/strong&gt; HackerRank and its «Interview Preparation Kit» are the best resources to prepare for Google coding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Just after the new year holiday I received timeslots for my interviews – the first one on 20th January at 11a.m. (duration 45 minutes), and the next one 15 minutes later. Wow, that was unexpected. I asked George if we could separate the interviews by a day, and received an unexpected answer: «We will need to conduct these on the same day unfortunately Ilya, to minimise the number of steps in the process that you are going through, and to keep as time efficient as possible.» It was another frustrating moment. I had been waiting for them for several weeks, and now they wanted to be «time efficient».&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frustrating moment #3.&lt;/strong&gt; Google doesn't respect your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This time the challenges were difficult for me. The first interview was about tricky searches on a graph. I only came up with a brute-force solution at first, and realized that it could be done with a graph later on – but it was too late.&lt;p&gt;The second interview was about the «2048 game». It was the first time I couldn't understand the task clearly, maybe because I hadn’t played the 2048 game at all. The questions were about a strategy to win in the 2048 game and an elegant solution to generate the next board state. Only two days later I realized that the 2048 game is some kind of «Game of Fifteen» and the solution could be found with the help of A* search algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was clearly my fault – I didn’t pay a lot of attention to graph algos during preparation. So don't repeat my mistakes – as I said earlier, put all of your efforts into interview preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week of waiting, George gave me a voice call and said that I didn’t pass the interview and I should improve my skills in big O notation and graph theory. He mentioned that I could reapply to Google next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/yf/jd/df/yfjddfuf03ox_rr56ddx5zmz0po.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did I take away from the Google interviewing process?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;When I started interviewing with Google I clearly understood that my chance of getting the job was not that high. What have I gained after all these interviews? Experience – a lot of experience – and a bit of an understanding about how Google works internally. Google has a myth that it’s a dream workplace. Maybe, but not for me. After several months of interviewing, I understood that Google is just another big enterprise company that has all these bureaucracy problems, opaque processes and weird rules. Further reading about Google’s other side can be found at the Michael Lynch post &lt;a href=&quot;https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/&quot;&gt;“Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;h3&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;After a tough interview with Google and several interviews with small start-ups and companies, I have concluded that employment is not for me. I want to be an entrepreneur and create my own company. The first obvious step for me is freelancing. I think I'm good at full stack web development (my preferred stack is Node.js/Javascript/React/Docker and you can check out what I've already done on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipirozhenko.com/projects&quot;&gt;«My Projects»&lt;/a&gt; page).&lt;p&gt;Now I’m eagerly looking for clients and contracts. If you think you have something for me or you know someone who needs a remote full stack developer, let’s have a chat. I'm happy to talk business or simply give you some free advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipirozhenko.com/blog/google-interview-2020/&quot;&gt;ipirozhenko.com/blog/google-interview-2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Katherine Johnson, NASA mathematician, has died at 101</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/science/katherine-johnson-dead.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/science/katherine-johnson-dead.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;They asked Katherine Johnson for the moon, and she gave it to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Wielding little more than a pencil, a slide rule and one of the finest mathematical minds in the country, Mrs. Johnson, who died at 101 on Monday at a retirement home in Newport News, Va., calculated the precise trajectories that would let Apollo 11 land on the moon in 1969 and, after Neil Armstrong’s history-making moonwalk, let it return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;A single error, she well knew, could have dire consequences for craft and crew. Her impeccable calculations had already helped plot the successful flight of Alan B. Shepard Jr., who became the first American in space when his Mercury spacecraft went aloft in 1961.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The next year, she likewise helped make it possible for John Glenn, in the Mercury vessel Friendship 7, to become the first American to orbit the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Yet throughout Mrs. Johnson’s 33 years in NASA’s Flight Research Division — the office from which the American space program sprang — and for decades afterward, almost no one knew her name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mrs. Johnson was one of several hundred rigorously educated, supremely capable yet largely unheralded women who, well before the modern feminist movement, worked as NASA mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But it was not only her sex that kept her long marginalized and long unsung: Katherine Coleman Goble Johnson, a West Virginia native who began her scientific career in the age of Jim Crow, was also African-American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In old age, Mrs. Johnson became the most celebrated of the small cadre of black women — perhaps three dozen — who at midcentury served as mathematicians for the space agency and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Their story was told in the 2016 Hollywood film “Hidden Figures,” based on Margot Lee Shetterly’s nonfiction book of the same title, published that year. The movie starred Taraji P. Henson as Mrs. Johnson, the film’s central figure. It also starred Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe as her real-life colleagues Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In January 2017 “Hidden Figures” received the Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The film was nominated for three Oscars, including best picture. Though it won none, the 98½-year-old Mrs. Johnson received a sustained standing ovation when she appeared onstage with the cast at the Academy Awards ceremony that February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Of the black women at the center of the film, Mrs. Johnson was the only one still living at the time of its release. By then, she had become the best-known member of her formerly unknown cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2015, President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, proclaiming, “Katherine G. Johnson refused to be limited by society’s expectations of her gender and race while expanding the boundaries of humanity’s reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2017, NASA dedicated a building in her honor, the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nasa-hidden-figures-katherine-johnson-honors_us_59c834a2e4b01cc57ff2fa2e&quot; title=&quot;The dedication.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility&lt;/a&gt;, at its Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That year, The Washington Post described her as “the most high-profile of the computers” — “computers” being the term originally used to designate Mrs. Johnson and her colleagues, much as “typewriters” was used in the 19th century to denote professional typists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She “helped our nation enlarge the frontiers of space,” NASA’s administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said in a statement on Monday, “even as she made huge strides that also opened doors for women and people of color in the universal human quest to explore space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As Mrs. Johnson herself was fond of saying, her tenure at Langley — from 1953 until her retirement in 1986 — was “a time when computers wore skirts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For some years at midcentury, the black women who worked as “computers” were subjected to a double segregation: Consigned to separate office, dining and bathroom facilities, they were kept separate from the much larger group of white women who also worked as NASA mathematicians. The white women in turn were segregated from the agency’s male mathematicians and engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-6517ab6c&quot;&gt;“As Good as Anybody”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But over time, the work of Mrs. Johnson and her colleagues — myriad calculations done mainly by hand, using slide rules, graph paper and clattering desktop calculating machines — won them a level of acceptance that for the most part transcended race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“NASA was a very professional organization,” Mrs. Johnson told The Observer of Fayetteville, N.C., in 2010. “They didn’t have time to be concerned about what color I was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Nor, she said, did she.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I don’t have a feeling of inferiority,” Mrs. Johnson said on at least one occasion. “Never had. I’m as good as anybody, but no better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;To the end of her life, Mrs. Johnson deflected praise for her role in sending astronauts into space, keeping them on course and bringing them safely home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I was just doing my job,” Ms. Shetterly heard her say repeatedly in the course of researching her book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But what a job it was — done, no less, by a woman born at a time, Ms. Shetterly wrote, “when the odds were more likely that she would die before age 35 than even finish high school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Creola Katherine Coleman was born on Aug. 26, 1918, in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., the youngest of four children of Joshua and Joylette (Lowe) Coleman. Her mother was a schoolteacher, her father a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;From her earliest childhood Katherine counted things: the number of dishes in the cupboard, the number of steps on the way to church and, as insurmountable a task as it might pose for one old enough to be daunted, the number of stars in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I couldn’t wait to get to high school to take algebra and geometry,” Mrs. Johnson told The Associated Press in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But for black children, the town’s segregated educational system went as far as only sixth grade. Thus, every fall, Joshua Coleman moved his family 125 miles away to Institute, W.Va.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Institute, Katherine’s older siblings, and then Katherine, attended the high school associated with the West Virginia Collegiate Institute, a historically black institution that became West Virginia State College and is now West Virginia State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Coleman remained in White Sulphur Springs to farm, and, when the Depression made farming untenable, to work as a bellman at the Greenbrier, a world-renowned resort there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Katherine entered high school at 10 and graduated at 14. The next year she entered West Virginia State. By her junior year, she had taken all the math courses the college had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Her mentor there, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Claytor.html&quot; title=&quot;About Dr. Claytor.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;William Waldron Schieffelin Claytor&lt;/a&gt;, only the third black person to earn a doctorate in mathematics from an American university, conceived special classes just for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You would make a good research mathematician,” he told his 17-year-old charge. “And I am going to prepare you for this career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Where will I find a job?” Katherine asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“That,” he replied, “will be your problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After graduating summa cum laude in 1937 with a double major in mathematics and French, she found, unsurprisingly, that research opportunities for black female teenage mathematicians were negligible. She took a job as a schoolteacher in Marion, Va.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 1940, she was chosen by the president of West Virginia State to be one of three black graduate students to integrate West Virginia University, the all-white institution in Morgantown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Two years earlier, ruling in the civil-rights case &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.blackpast.org/primary/missouri-ex-rel-gaines-v-canada-1938&quot; title=&quot;About the case.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the United States Supreme Court held that where comparable graduate programs did not exist at black universities in Missouri, the state was obliged to admit black graduate students to its white state universities. In the wake of that decision, West Virginia’s governor, Homer Holt, chose to desegregate public graduate schools in his state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Now married to James Francis Goble, a chemistry teacher, she entered West Virginia University in the summer of 1940, studying advanced mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The greatest challenge she faced,” Ms. Shetterly wrote, “was finding a course that didn’t duplicate Dr. Claytor’s meticulous tutelage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But after that summer session, on discovering she was pregnant with her first child, she withdrew from the university. She returned with her husband to Marion and was occupied with marriage, motherhood and teaching for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-267a8137&quot;&gt;NASA Opens to Women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Then, in 1952, Katherine Goble heard that Langley was hiring black women as mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The oldest of NASA’s field centers, Langley had been established by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1917. In 1935, it began hiring white women with mathematics degrees to relieve its male engineers of the tedious work of crunching numbers by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Within a decade, several hundred white women had been employed as computers there. Most, unlike the male scientists at the agency, were classified as subprofessionals, paid less than their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In June 1941, as the nation prepared for war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;amp;doc=72&quot; title=&quot;Text of the order.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executive Order 8802&lt;/a&gt;, barring racial discrimination in the defense industry. In 1943, with the wartime need for human computers greater than ever, the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, as the research facility was then known, began advertising for black women trained in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Among the first hired was &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/content/dorothy-vaughan-biography&quot; title=&quot;About Mrs. Vaughan.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dorothy Vaughan&lt;/a&gt;, who began work that year. In 1951, Mrs. Vaughan became the first black section head at NACA, as the advisory committee was known, when she was officially placed in charge of Langley’s West Area Computing Unit, the segregated office to which the black women were relegated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It was in this unit that Katherine Goble began work in June 1953, tabulating sheets of data for the agency’s engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By the time she arrived, the company cafeteria had already undergone de facto desegregation: Its “Colored Computers” sign, designating a table in the back for the women, had been a salubrious casualty of the war years. But the separate bathrooms remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Quite by accident, Katherine Goble broke that color line herself. While the agency’s bathrooms for black employees were marked as such, many bathrooms for whites were unmarked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Without realizing it, she had been using a white women’s restroom since her arrival. By the time she became aware of her error, she was set in her routine and disinclined to change. No one took her to task, and she used the white bathrooms from then on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Two weeks into her new job, she was borrowed by the Flight Research Division, which occupied an immense hangar on the Langley grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;There, the only black member of the staff, she helped calculate the aerodynamic forces on airplanes. For that task, as she quickly demonstrated, she came armed with an invaluable asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The guys all had graduate degrees in mathematics; they had forgotten all the geometry they ever knew,” Mrs. Johnson said in the Fayetteville Observer interview. “I still remembered mine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She remained in the division for the rest of her career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;By the early 1960s, with the United States provoked by Soviet prowess in space, NASA was under great pressure to launch an astronaut. It fell to the Flight Research Division to do many of the associated calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Our assignment was the trajectory,” Mrs. Johnson explained to The Associated Press. “As NASA got ready to put someone in space, they needed to know what the launch conditions were. It was our assignment to develop the launch window and determine where it was going to land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-3ez4hu eoo0vm40&quot; id=&quot;link-58a3b671&quot;&gt;Clandestine Calculations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Their work was secret — at times even from the mathematicians themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We were the pioneers of the space era,” Mrs. Johnson told The Daily Press, a Virginia newspaper, in 1990. “You had to read Aviation Week to find out what you’d done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;She routinely logged 16-hour days, once falling asleep at the wheel of her car and waking up — safe, providentially — at the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But the work engaged her deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I loved every single day of it,” she told Ms. Shetterly. “There wasn’t one day when I didn’t wake up excited to go to work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It helped sustain her through the death of her first husband from brain cancer in 1956, leaving her, at 38, a widow with three adolescent daughters. She married James A. Johnson, a United States Army captain, in 1959.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Over the years, Mrs. Johnson published more than two dozen technical papers. She was among the first women at NASA to be a named author or co-author on an agency report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ceaselessly curious about the aerospace technology that underpinned her work, she made it possible for women to attend the agency’s scientific briefings, formerly closed-door affairs reserved for male staff members. (“Is there a law against it?” Mrs. Johnson asked, and when her male colleagues, after some head-scratching, concluded that, no, there was no law, they let her in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;After retiring from NASA, Mrs. Johnson became a public advocate for mathematics education, speaking widely and visiting schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Her death was announced by NASA. She is survived by two daughters, Joylette Hylick and Katherine Moore; six grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Connie Garcia, died in 2010; her second husband, James Johnson, died in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mrs. Johnson’s colleague Mary Jackson died in 2005; Dorothy Vaughan died in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;An autobiography by Mrs. Johnson for young readers, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/reaching-for-the-moon-katherine-johnson-excerpt.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Reaching for the Moon,”&lt;/a&gt; was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-ew4tgv&quot; aria-label=&quot;companion column&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In 2016, Mrs. Johnson, self-effacing as ever at 98, seemed somewhat indifferent to the fuss surrounding the feature film about her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I shudder,” she told The New York Times that September, some three months before the film’s release, having heard that the screenwriters might have made her character seem a tiny bit aggressive. “I was never aggressive.” (As things transpired, Mrs. Johnson liked the finished film very much, Ms. Shetterly said in an interview for this obituary in 2017.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mrs. Johnson may not have been aggressive, but she was assuredly esteemed. An index of just how esteemed she was came from Mr. Glenn, Mercury astronaut and future United States senator, who died in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In early 1962, a few days before he prepared to orbit the Earth in Friendship 7, Mr. Glenn made a final check of his planned orbital trajectory. The trajectory had been generated by a computer — not the flesh-and-blood kind, but the electronic sort, which were starting to supplant the agency’s human calculators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Electronic computation was still something of a novelty at NASA, and Mr. Glenn was unsettled by the use of a soulless mass of metal to divine something on which his life depended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;He asked that Mrs. Johnson double-check the machine’s figures by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-exrw3m evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“If she says the numbers are good,” he declared, “I’m ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>On Voice Coding</title>
<link>https://dusty.phillips.codes/2020/02/15/on-voice-coding/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dusty.phillips.codes/2020/02/15/on-voice-coding/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;main-content-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had repetitive stress injury (RSI) flareups on and off for many years. I’ve kept them under control mostly through use of an Kinesis Advantage ergonomic keyboard that I’ve had for fifteen years. However, several months ago, I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and instructed to avoid typing if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make my living programming and writing. My hobbies are programming and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I had to do was completely scrap two book projects. Then I spent some time researching voice coding programs. I clearly remember attending a talk on voice coding by Tavis Rudd at PyCon 2013, and I wondered how the voice coding space has changed since then. It turns out, it has come a long way, and in 2020, programming with your voice is entirely doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too finicky to set up, and while there’s a bit of a learning curve, I was productive within the first week. Six months later, I am quite comfortable with voice coding. I am not quite as efficient as I am while typing, and my brain is more tired at the end of the day, but at least I don’t lose my voice anymore! Surprisingly, dictating free text is a lot harder than actually writing code. Dictating this article is my first attempt at doing any major work in English. Hopefully it will go well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to give it a shot, you’ll have to spend some money, and jump through a few hoops. But if it’s the difference between programming and not programming, it may be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;nav id=&quot;TableOfContents&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-money&quot;&gt;The Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, there are several speech recognition APIs that can be used for voice programming. However, the only one that is currently really worth using is Dragon NaturallySpeaking. And the Dragon Home edition is not sufficient. So you’ll need to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nuance.com/dragon/business-solutions/dragon-professional-individual.html&quot;&gt;Dragon professional&lt;/a&gt; which will set you back a couple hundred dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Dragon currently only supports the Windows operating system. I was lucky here, since I had recently switched to Windows after getting a Microsoft Surface Book. However, most coders I know use either Macs or Linux machines. If you need to buy a Windows 10 license, it’s going to add to your costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, speech recognition is a fairly CPU intensive task, so you may even need to upgrade your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the difference between being thoroughly frustrated, and being functional when dictating is a very good microphone. That will probably set you back another few hundred dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I’ve spent about a thousand Canadian dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-microphone&quot;&gt;The Microphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got by with the microphone in my Sennheiser headphones for a couple months, but it drove me crazy. I finally broke down and bought myself a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tablemike.com/tablemikes/3-in-1/&quot;&gt;USB TableMike&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t regretted it. Since switching, I am able to code for longer periods of time, without feeling too tired. I have to make far fewer corrections, which means that I can speak longer before pausing to make sure that the commands are showing up correctly. The delay between speech and seeing it on the screen is much shorter with the TableMike, which just makes everything go more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that not all high-end mics are actually useful for speech recognition. You will probably not be able to repurpose your band’s professional recording studio microphone. I did quite a bit of research before settling on the TableMike, but there are a few other options you can look at. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.knowbrainer.com/store/pc/viewCategories.asp?idCategory=15&quot;&gt;KnowBrainer&lt;/a&gt; has a good collection of microphones that have been specifically vetted for dictation software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to choose again, I would probably get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tablemike.com/audio-adapters/speechware-multiadapter/&quot;&gt;SpeechWare MultiAdapter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tablemike.com/twistmike/&quot;&gt;TwistMike&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is longer and can optionally be wrapped around the neck, in addition to being used as a table microphone. This would make it better for adjusting my posture throughout the day. However the combination of the two is quite a bit more expensive than the basic TableMike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-software&quot;&gt;The Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary tool you need to set up a voice programming environment is a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;Caster&lt;/a&gt;. It is an open-source program written in Python and built on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly&quot;&gt;dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; project. It connects to Dragon NaturallySpeaking with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/natlink/files/natlink/natlink4.2/&quot;&gt;NatLink&lt;/a&gt; tool. (I swear I haven’t seen a project on source forge for at least ten years!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caster’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; look a bit intimidating, but it’s actually not that bad. Here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Install Dragon NaturallySpeaking first&lt;/em&gt;, and make sure that it’s working with your microphone. Go through the tutorial but don’t pay too much attention to it. I use Caster’s commands almost exclusively instead of the ones provided by Dragon. You will be quite frustrated at first, but don’t worry, it does get better. If you started out with a decent microphone, hopefully you won’t be quite as frustrated as I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure that you install the 32-bit version of Python 2&lt;/em&gt;. I know Python 2 is extremely near end of life. As the person who wrote one of the very first books on Python 3, I find it very frustrating to have such an outdated version of the interpreter on my system. Hopefully it will be ported soon, maybe by you, once you get comfortable with voice coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1&lt;/em&gt; Step through the wizard on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt; and download the file &lt;code&gt;vcredist_x86.exe&lt;/code&gt; when prompted to do so. On Windows 10, NatLink will not work correctly without this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then install NatLink and Caster as described in the installation instructions. I recommend checking out Caster from the fork of the repo in your own github account as you will certainly want to make command customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a huge relief when you can say &lt;code&gt;arch brov char delta&lt;/code&gt; and see &lt;code&gt;abcd&lt;/code&gt; show up in your text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;print-the-cheat-sheet&quot;&gt;Print The Cheat Sheet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster/blob/master/docs/CasterQuickReference.pdf&quot;&gt;Cheat Sheet&lt;/a&gt; under your pillow for the first month or two. You’ll be looking up commands all the time. Also keep a pen nearby so you can annotate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will probably also want to make a cheat sheet for your preferred application commands and programming languages. I’m not sure if the one I made for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dusty.phillips.codes/rustvscodecastercheat.pdf&quot;&gt;Rust and Visual Studio code&lt;/a&gt; is useful, but it’s there if you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now might also be a good time to introduce yourself in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitter.im/dictation-toolbox/Caster&quot;&gt;Caster gitter channel&lt;/a&gt;. These folks are some of the kindest and most helpful people in the open source community. Even if you don’t need help, they are just good folks get to know! But, frankly, you will need help. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend Visual Studio Code as a text editor in general, but it’s actually particularly nice for voice coding, especially if you are not using Windows. I have a Linux machine where I do all my development, and I log into it using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview&quot;&gt;Remote Development&lt;/a&gt; extension, which has always worked flawlessly for me. If you don’t have a spare UNIX machine lying around, you can also set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Even if you’re a Mac or Linux user, it should give you an environment that you are somewhat comfortable in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason that I recommend VS code is that the Caster developers seem to use it themselves. The caster &lt;a href=&quot;https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Application_Commands_Quick_Reference/#visual-studio-code&quot;&gt;application commands&lt;/a&gt; for VS code are particularly extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dragon-naturallyspeaking-options&quot;&gt;Dragon Naturallyspeaking Options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to tell that Dragon is a fairly old code base that is mostly developed in maintenance mode. They seem to improve the artificial intelligence with each release, but the user experience is quite nineties! As such, I recommend disabling most of their features, and relying on Caster commands instead. Specifically I did the following in the Dragon options menus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disable all the checkboxes in the “Correction” menu, except for the “Automatically add words to the active vocabulary” option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the “Commands” menu make sure to check the “Require click to select…” checkboxes. Otherwise you will find yourself accidentally clicking buttons or menu items instead of inserting text into your editor. I’ve disabled the other checkboxes in that menu as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the “Do not show tips” button under the Appearance menu. You may want to wait a while for this, but I find that the tips are just distracting because Caster commands work better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a good quality microphone as I advised, you may want to set the “speed versus accuracy” slider in the “Miscellaneous” menu to a fairly high value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncheck the “Use the dictation box for unsupported applications” checkbox. Use Caster &lt;a href=&quot;https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Text_Manipulation/&quot;&gt;text manipulation&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;manage-dragon-vocabulary&quot;&gt;Manage Dragon vocabulary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon is designed for English-language input, not the kinds of names that you typically apply to your variables, classes, and functions. As such, you will probably have to add words and phrases to the vocabulary on a regular basis. This is easily done from the Vocabulary Editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often, you will find it convenient to add entire phrases, as opposed to individual words. Your variable names are probably phrases that are comprised of words that are common in English, but are not often used together as phrases. For example, in my work I use the variable name &lt;code&gt;beanstalk_miner&lt;/code&gt;. The word &lt;code&gt;beanstalk&lt;/code&gt; is part of the English vocabulary, as is the word &lt;code&gt;miner&lt;/code&gt;. But they are not normally used together. I tended to get that phrase recognized as &lt;code&gt;be in stock minor&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;being stuck minor&lt;/code&gt;. Using the vocabulary editor, I added the phrase &lt;code&gt;beanstalk miner&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that I didn’t include an underscore in the phrase used in the vocabulary manager, even though it is included in my variable name. The formatting of variable names is, as you should know if you have read the Caster cheat sheet, not part of the vocabulary, but using special Caster commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend being very aggressive in managing your vocabulary. If there is a phrase that is causing you problems, just delete that phrase from the vocabulary. For example, when I get confused mid-sentence, I often make an inadvertent hissing sound. This invariably gets recognized as &lt;code&gt;'s&lt;/code&gt;. So entered the Vocabulary Editor and searched for &lt;code&gt;'s&lt;/code&gt; and removed the matching symbols. It can also be handy to remove words that insert symbols that are better inserted as Caster commands. I have removed the &lt;code&gt;point&lt;/code&gt; command which maps to a period. I don’t want periods showing up in my text unless I use the Caster &lt;code&gt;dot&lt;/code&gt; command. Unfortunately, Dragon won’t let me remove the &lt;code&gt;period&lt;/code&gt; command from my vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have even considered going through the vocabulary and deleting many phrases and names that I don’t need. That might speed up recognition, but the Dragon vocabulary is huge and it’s probably not worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to experiment with having custom vocabularies based only on my project files and their dependencies. However, writing the software to do such analysis would actually be a pretty big project in itself. It would probably also not be terribly helpful to disable the default Dragon vocabulary in favour of a project-specific vocabulary since I tend to write extensive English-language doc strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing to mention about vocabulary, is that Dragon does a pretty good job of adapting to your speaking habits. Use it for a couple of weeks and you will find that it is making fewer errors as you go. Don’t forget to launch accuracy tuning from the &lt;code&gt;Audio&lt;/code&gt; menu every few months, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;renaming-caster-commands&quot;&gt;Renaming Caster Commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you start to use the commands in the Caster cheat sheet, you will undoubtedly find that some of them get confused on a regular basis. For example, I found that the word &lt;code&gt;ace&lt;/code&gt;, which is supposed to insert a space character, would often be confused with &lt;code&gt;lease&lt;/code&gt;, which is supposed to move the cursor to the left. This got annoying really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily it is really easy to rename words using Caster transformers. Let’s try doing this using voice commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First say &lt;code&gt;enable bring me&lt;/code&gt; to enable the &lt;a href=&quot;https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Bringme/&quot;&gt;bring me&lt;/a&gt; command, which allows you to open favourite programs, files and websites. Caster ships with some default bring me commands for managing itself. Say &lt;code&gt;bring me caster bring me file&lt;/code&gt; to see what they are. (Don’t try to edit this file directly while Dragon is running as gets overwritten when Caster shuts down. Use the commands outlined in the documentation to edit the file instead).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say &lt;code&gt;bring me caster transformers file&lt;/code&gt; to edit a configuration file in whichever editor is configured to open it. (Make sure that you have set it appropriately in Windows Explorer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;TextReplacerTransformer = true&lt;/code&gt; and save the file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say &lt;code&gt;bring me caster transformer file&lt;/code&gt; (there’s no &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; after transformer this time) to open the &lt;code&gt;words.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the file as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/CCR/#simplified-filter-rules&quot;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, the documentation is being rewritten to incorporate some exciting changes that happened recently. If you want to read it, just say &lt;code&gt;bring me caster documentation&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say &lt;code&gt;reboot caster&lt;/code&gt; to reload the entire app. Caster is capable of reloading rules on the fly when you save a grammar file but I’m not certain if this works with &lt;code&gt;words.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how my &lt;code&gt;words.txt&lt;/code&gt; currently looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;squat -&amp;gt; bend
spark -&amp;gt; poke
ticky -&amp;gt; dunk
chicky -&amp;gt; applet
chocky -&amp;gt; chocolate
deckle -&amp;gt; cota
lease -&amp;gt; leap
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;NOT_SPECS&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
comma -&amp;gt; hang
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember exactly why I made all those changes. I know that &lt;code&gt;deckle&lt;/code&gt; was often confused with &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; which tended to switch up a colon for the letter e. The three commands that end in &lt;code&gt;ky&lt;/code&gt; are often inserted when I use the word &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;, which I use a lot since I work in crypto! I don’t use and will never use Java so I knew that the word &lt;code&gt;applet&lt;/code&gt; would be safe. The word &lt;code&gt;dunk&lt;/code&gt; is actually named after the &lt;code&gt;donk&lt;/code&gt; sounds that my childhood Speak N Spell used to admit whenever it was inserting an apostrophe! The command mapping &lt;code&gt;comma&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;hang&lt;/code&gt; was added so that I didn’t confuse the Caster command for &lt;code&gt;comma&lt;/code&gt; the one provided by Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You undoubtedly have your own hangups that you need to change, but these are the ones I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;caster-rules&quot;&gt;Caster Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caster documentation for writing your own grammar rules is a bit hard to follow. I am under the impression that it is being rewritten, but for me it was much easier to read the source code from some existing simple rules in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster&quot;&gt;Caster repository&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dusty-phillips/Caster/tree/dusty_customizations/castervoice/rules/apps/editor/vscode_rules&quot;&gt;Visual Studio code&lt;/a&gt; commands are fairly straightforward. The fact that there are two files reflects the difference between CCR and non-CCR commands. I’ll leave you to peruse the Caster documentation to figure out what the difference is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep a local fork of this repository and maintain a branch on top of the latest master. My customizations are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dusty-phillips/Caster/tree/dusty_customizations&quot;&gt;this branch&lt;/a&gt; if you want to use them for reference. I have customizations on the Visual Studio code file because I don’t use the full key bindings in a couple cases, and a few customizations on the Rust grammar to match my workflow. These customizations aren’t as big as they used to be because the team has accepted a couple of pull requests to add my customizations that are more generally useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-custom-rule-to-fix-mixed-up-words&quot;&gt;A custom rule to fix mixed up words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you carefully manage your vocabularies, there will undoubtedly be words that are confused on a regular basis. I keep a custom Caster rule to help me distinguish between these words. You can put your custom rules in the Caster rules folder (&lt;code&gt;bring me caster rules&lt;/code&gt;). I have one named &lt;code&gt;tricky.py&lt;/code&gt; (short for tricky words) that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;from dragonfly import MappingRule, Choice

from castervoice.lib.const import CCRType
from castervoice.lib.actions import Text, Key
from castervoice.lib.ctrl.mgr.rule_details import RuleDetails
from castervoice.lib.merge.state.short import R
from castervoice.lib.merge.mergerule import MergeRule



class TrickyWords(MappingRule):
    pronunciation = &quot;tricky words&quot;
    mapping = {
        &quot;fix &amp;lt;word&amp;gt;&quot;: R(Text(&quot;%(word)s&quot;)),
    }
    extras = [
        Choice(&quot;word&quot;, {
            &quot;at&quot;: &quot;add&quot;,
            &quot;rest&quot;: &quot;rust&quot;,
            &quot;note&quot;: &quot;node&quot;, 
            &quot;bite&quot;: &quot;byte&quot;,
            &quot;bites&quot;: &quot;bytes&quot;,
            &quot;right&quot;: &quot;write&quot;,
            &quot;sink&quot;: &quot;sync&quot;,
        })
    ]



def get_rule():
    return TrickyWords, RuleDetails(name=&quot;tricky words&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t know Python it should be fairly easy to figure out how to add your own words. Note that the rule is not enabled by default. You’ll need to say &lt;code&gt;enable tricky words&lt;/code&gt; to activate it. Then to insert a word that is often interpreted incorrectly, say &lt;code&gt;fix bites&lt;/code&gt; and it will insert the word &lt;code&gt;bytes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one other custom rule that I used to execute common commands in the VScode terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;from dragonfly import MappingRule, Choice

from castervoice.lib.const import CCRType
from castervoice.lib.actions import Text, Key
from castervoice.lib.ctrl.mgr.rule_details import RuleDetails
from castervoice.lib.merge.state.short import R
from castervoice.lib.merge.mergerule import MergeRule



class CLI(MergeRule):
    pronunciation = &quot;CLI&quot;
    mapping = {
        &quot;giddy&quot;: R(Text(&quot;git &quot;)),
        &quot;CD&quot;: R(Text(&quot;cd &quot;)),
        &quot;parent&quot;: R(Text(&quot;../&quot;)),
        &quot;list files&quot;: R(Text(&quot;ls &quot;)),
        &quot;move file&quot;: R(Text(&quot;mv &quot;)),
        &quot;copy file&quot;: R(Text(&quot;cp &quot;)),
        &quot;remove file&quot;: R(Text(&quot;rm &quot;)),
        &quot;NPM&quot;: R(Text(&quot;npm &quot;)),
        &quot;neon build release&quot;: R(Text(&quot;neon build --release&quot;)),
        &quot;cargo build release&quot;: R(Text(&quot;cargo build --release&quot;)),
        &quot;cargo test release&quot;: R(Text(&quot;cargo test --release&quot;)),
        &quot;cargo run release&quot;: R(Text(&quot;cargo run --release&quot;)),

        &quot;previous command&quot;: R(Key(&quot;c-p&quot;)),
        &quot;exit shall&quot;: R(Key(&quot;c-d&quot;)),
        &quot;interrupt&quot;: R(Key(&quot;c-c&quot;)),
    }



def get_rule():
    return CLI, RuleDetails(
                           executable=&quot;code&quot;,
                           title=&quot;Visual Studio Code&quot;,
                           ccrtype=CCRType.APP)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these are generically useful, while others are specific to my workflow. It may not be obvious that you can string these commands together with other commands as in &lt;code&gt;cd parent snake beanstalk miner slash laws tests&lt;/code&gt; which inserts &lt;code&gt;cd ../beanstalk_miner/tests&lt;/code&gt;. This is because it is a merge rule from the continuous command recognition module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that might be a little bit off here is the &lt;code&gt;previous command&lt;/code&gt; which maps to a &lt;code&gt;control-P&lt;/code&gt; keypress. I have that command mapped to &lt;code&gt;bindkey '^P' history-beginning-search-backward&lt;/code&gt; in my &lt;code&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;. There is a similar command for bash but I can’t remember what it is off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;get_rule&lt;/code&gt; function I have this limited to only execute these commands when Visual Studio code is enabled. If you tend to work from the Windows command prompt or some other terminal emulator you will probably want to make it apply to those programs instead, or make it generically applicable as I did with the tricky words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;text-manipulation&quot;&gt;Text Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most powerful and useful feature of Caster is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/Text_Manipulation/&quot;&gt;Text Manipulation And Navigation&lt;/a&gt; grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As just one example, when Dragon misrecognizes &lt;code&gt;caster&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;castor&lt;/code&gt; I just have to say &lt;code&gt;replace leap oscar with echo&lt;/code&gt; (bearing in mind that I have remapped &lt;code&gt;lease&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;leap&lt;/code&gt; for left navigation in my &lt;code&gt;words.txt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation is fairly straightforward, but it takes a little bit of practice to get used to working with it. Without these rules, I would be unable to write and edit this article!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You will need to issue the &lt;code&gt;enable text manipulation&lt;/code&gt; command before you are able to use these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am proud to say that I added the capitalization commands and had my patch accepted. You can thank dusty &lt;code&gt;capital leap dusty&lt;/code&gt;. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;snippets&quot;&gt;Snippets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I type fast enough that I have never had much use for snippets in my text editor. Perhaps if I’d used them more effectively, I would not have developed the RSI symptoms that I have! However, with voice editing snippets are invaluable. Here is just one example that I use all the time (Visual Studio Code syntax):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;       &quot;function&quot;: {
                &quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;function&quot;,
                &quot;body&quot;: [
                        &quot;fn $1(${2:&amp;amp;self, }) ${3:-&amp;gt; }{&quot;,
                        &quot;    $4&quot;,
                        &quot;}&quot;
                ],
                &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Insert a rust function&quot;
   }
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inserts a Rust function with positions that I can tab between to insert the name, arguments, return value, and body. I have default values for the arguments and the return value arrow which makes it easy to confirm or overwrite them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write lots of snippets! The more you have the more you will enjoy voice coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-curve&quot;&gt;Learning Curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when everything is working correctly, voice coding is hard. For example I just had to &lt;code&gt;replace leap wainscotting with voice coding&lt;/code&gt; in the previous sentence. I’m sure you’ve seen many more voice-o’s throughout the article. I had to correct something in just about every sentence, although that’s not as bad as it sounds using the text replacement commands I described above. The replacement is not necessarily because Dragon got it wrong, but because I changed my mind about what I wanted to say midsentence. This is one of the reasons that I find it easier to code than to write English text. The commands are shorter and I don’t have to complete a thought before I start saying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me longer to become comfortable with voice coding than it did to learn Dvorak two decades ago, and that’s not just not because my brain moves slower these days! It probably took me about two months to stop looking at my cheat sheet every few minutes. I didn’t stop swearing at my computer (which inserts some weird strings into your document, since Dragon doesn’t seem to know those words) until I got the new microphone. Even then it took me quite a while to become comfortable with stringing together long commands without waiting to see if they worked out all right and I still have to correct them regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when my hands were working, I was a really fast typer; probably around a hundred words per minute. In comparison, voice coding feels really slow. About once a week I give in and start typing again and it feels like a real luxury… until the pain starts to set in. I certainly hope that I can get back to typing sometime in the future, but I am told that nerves take a long time to heal and I don’t want to take any chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rsi-alternatives&quot;&gt;RSI Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most unfortunate thing about dictation is that it takes a fair bit of money upfront before you can find out whether it will work for you. Using a microphone you already have or the free dictation software does not give you any indication of how powerful voice coding can be. But it would really suck to spend the upfront money only to discover that it doesn’t work as well for you as you had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been on the edge of carpal tunnel syndrome for a long portion of my coding career. I have tried almost everything to avoid it. Here are some suggestions if you are not ready to take the leap into voice coding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an ergonomic keyboard. I have been using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/&quot;&gt;Kinesis Advantage Pro&lt;/a&gt; for fifteen years. I am reasonably confident that I would not be in this mess if I had kept using it! However I was tending to do my work using that keyboard and doing my hobby writing on the couch using my laptop keyboard. This is a bad idea. Don’t use a laptop keyboard and especially don’t do it to try and write entire books. Unfortunately the Kinesis Advantage Pro is about as expensive as Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I tried using a Microsoft Sculpt, but it didn’t work for my pain. In fact I have it for sale if you’re interested!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an alternative keyboard layout. When my wrists first started acting up when I was a teen (I was already coding lot by then), I switched to Dvorak. Colemak had not been invented yet, but it is probably a reasonable alternative these days, as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use modal editing, which is to say vim key bindings. This is less important if you’re using the Kinesis keyboard as the thumb keys allow chained keyboard shortcuts to be inserted with less painful contortions. Unfortunately, using modal editing in, for example, Visual Studio code, requires changing all of your key bindings. This means that if you want to switch between typing and voice recognition, you will have to disable the plug-in. That gets old real fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use sticky keys. That’s where you can press and release the control key before the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; key in order to save a document, for example. This is an operating system level configuration. It takes some getting used to, but so does everything else you might attempt!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a standing desk once in a while. Do not try to use it all day long, or you might destroy your lower back. But do try to switch different positions throughout the day. People tend to think that repetitive stress injuries are all in the wrist and hands, but those nerves all have to connect to the brain which means that that posture in the shoulders can also have a devastating effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut back on your screen time. Typing isn’t the only thing that’s ruining your hands. Notice how painful it is next time you’re holding a mobile phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t write books. This is the thing that I have missed the most, by far. I love writing about as much as I love coding. Find a hobby that involves a whole body workout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<og:description>I have had repetitive stress injury (RSI) flareups on and off for many years. I’ve kept them under control mostly through use of an Kinesis Advantage ergonomic keyboard that I’ve had for fifteen years. However, several months ago, I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and instructed to avoid typing if at all possible. I make my living programming and writing. My hobbies are programming and writing. The first thing I had to do was completely scrap two book projects.</og:description>

<title>“We found PayPal vulnerabilities and PayPal punished us for it”</title>
<link>https://cybernews.com/security/we-found-6-critical-paypal-vulnerabilities-and-paypal-punished-us/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://cybernews.com/security/we-found-6-critical-paypal-vulnerabilities-and-paypal-punished-us/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the news, it seems that PayPal gives a lot of money to ethical hackers that find bugs in their tools and services. In March 2018, PayPal announced that they’re increasing their maximum bug bounty payment to &lt;a href=&quot;https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/paypal-bug-bounty-increases-to-30k&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;$30,000&lt;/a&gt; – a pretty nice sum for hackers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, ever since PayPal moved its bug bounty program to HackerOne, its entire system for supporting bug bounty hunters who identify and report bugs has become more opaque, mired in illogical delays, vague responses, and suspicious behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our analysts discovered six vulnerabilities in PayPal – ranging from dangerous exploits that can allow anyone to bypass their two-factor authentication (2FA), to being able to send malicious code through their SmartChat system – we were met with non-stop delays, unresponsive staff, and lack of appreciation. Below, we go over each vulnerability in detail and why we believe they’re so dangerous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we pushed the HackerOne staff for clarification on these issues, they removed points from our Reputation scores, relegating our profiles to a suspicious, spammy level. This happened even when the issue was eventually patched, although we received no bounty, credit, or even a thanks. Instead, we got our &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hackerone.com/blog/introducing-reputation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reputation scores&lt;/a&gt; (which start out at 100) negatively impacted, leaving us worse off than if we’d reported nothing at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear where the majority of the problem lies. Before going through HackerOne, we attempted to communicate directly with PayPal, but we received only copy-paste Customer Support responses and humdrum, say-nothing responses from human representatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be a larger issue of HackerOne’s triage system, in which they employ Security Analysts to check the submitted issues before passing them onto PayPal. The only problem – these Security Analysts are hackers themselves, and they have clear motivation for delaying an issue in order to collect the bounty themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is a lot more money to be made from using or selling these exploits on the black market, we believe the PayPal/HackerOne system is flawed and will lead to fewer ethical hackers providing the necessary help in finding and patching PayPal’s tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vulnerabilities we discovered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our analysis of PayPal’s mobile apps and website UI, we were able to uncover a series of significant issues. We’ll explain these vulnerabilities from the most severe to least severe, as well as how each vulnerability can lead to serious issues for the end user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#1 Bypassing PayPal’s two-factor authentication (2FA)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the current version of PayPal for Android (v. 7.16.1), the CyberNews research team was able to bypass PayPal’s phone or email verification, which for ease of terminology we can call two-factor authentication (2FA). Their 2FA, which is called “Authflow” on PayPal, is normally triggered when a user logs into their account from a new device, location or IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/security-check.png&quot; alt=&quot;PayPal's &amp;quot;2FA&amp;quot; security check, which is easily bypassable&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1934&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/security-check.png 400w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/security-check-199x300.png 199w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How we did it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to bypass PayPal’s 2FA, our researcher used the PayPal mobile app and a MITM proxy, like Charles proxy. Then, through a series of steps, the researcher was able to get an elevated token to enter the account. (Since the vulnerability hasn’t been patched yet, we can’t go into detail of how it was done.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-2fa-bypass2.png&quot; alt=&quot;token values with permisions&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1933&quot; width=&quot;713&quot; height=&quot;346&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-2fa-bypass2.png 951w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-2fa-bypass2-300x145.png 300w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-2fa-bypass2-768x372.png 768w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-2fa-bypass2-750x364.png 750w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is very simple, and only takes seconds or minutes. This means that attackers can gain easy access to accounts, rendering PayPal’s lauded security system useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s the worst case scenario here?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stolen PayPal credentials can go for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/22/hacked-spotify-hulu-accounts-fetch-millions-for-data-thieves.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;just $1.50 on the black market&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, it’s exactly because it’s so difficult to get into people’s PayPal accounts with stolen credentials that these stolen credentials are so cheap. PayPal’s authflow is set up to detect and block suspicious login attempts, usually related to a new device or IP, besides other suspicious actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with our 2FA bypass, that security measure is null and void. Hackers can buy stolen credentials in bulk, log in with those credentials, bypass 2FA in minutes, and have complete access to those accounts. With many known and unknown stolen credentials on the market, this is potentially a huge loss for many PayPal customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PayPal’s response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll assume that HackerOne’s response is representative of PayPal’s response. For this issue, PayPal decided that, since the user’s account must already be compromised for this attack to work, “there does not appear to be any security implications as a direct result of this behavior.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2fa-hackerone.png&quot; alt=&quot;HackerOne's muted response to the PayPal 2FA bypass&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1734&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2fa-hackerone.png 746w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2fa-hackerone-300x66.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on that, they closed the issue as &lt;strong&gt;Not Applicable&lt;/strong&gt;, costing us 5 reputation points in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#2 Phone verification without OTP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysts discovered that it’s pretty easy to confirm a new phone without an OTP (One-Time Pin). PayPal recently introduced a new system where it checks whether a phone number is registered under the same name as the account holder. If not, it rejects the phone number. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How we did it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a user registers a new phone number, an onboard call is made to api-m.paypal.com, which sends the status of the phone confirmation. We can easily change this call, and PayPal will then register the phone as confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/editing-phone-number-on-paypal-account-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;editing phone number on paypal account&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1899&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/editing-phone-number-on-paypal-account-1.png 1015w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/editing-phone-number-on-paypal-account-1-300x140.png 300w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/editing-phone-number-on-paypal-account-1-768x357.png 768w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/editing-phone-number-on-paypal-account-1-750x349.png 750w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call can be repeated on already registered accounts to verify the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s the worst case scenario here?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scammers can find lots of uses for this vulnerability, but the major implication is unmissable. By bypassing this phone verification, it will make it much easier for scammers to create fraudulent accounts, especially since there’s no need to receive an SMS verification code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PayPal’s response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the PayPal team via HackerOne took this issue more seriously. However, after a few exchanges, they stopped responding to our queries, and recently PayPal itself (not the HackerOne staff) locked this report, meaning that we aren’t able to comment any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-locked-phone-disclosure.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1954&quot; width=&quot;599&quot; height=&quot;429&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-locked-phone-disclosure.png 798w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-locked-phone-disclosure-300x215.png 300w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-locked-phone-disclosure-768x550.png 768w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-locked-phone-disclosure-120x86.png 120w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-locked-phone-disclosure-350x250.png 350w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/paypal-locked-phone-disclosure-750x538.png 750w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#3 Sending money security bypass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal has set up certain security measures in order to help avoid fraud and other malicious actions on the tool. One of these is a security measure that’s triggered when one of the following conditions, or a combination of these, is met:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You’re using a new device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re trying to send payments from a different location or IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a change in your usual sending pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The owning account is not “aged” well (meaning that it’s pretty new)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these conditions are met, PayPal may throw up a few types of errors to the users, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You’ll need to link a new payment method to send the money” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Your payment was denied, please try again later”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How we did it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysts found that PayPal’s sending money security block is vulnerable to brute force attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s the worst case scenario here?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar in impact to Vulnerability #1 mentioned above. An attacker with access to stolen PayPal credentials can access these accounts after easily bypassing PayPal’s security measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PayPal’s response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we submitted this to HackerOne, they responded that this is an “out-of-scope” issue since it requires stolen PayPal accounts. As such, they closed the issue as &lt;strong&gt;Not Applicable&lt;/strong&gt;, costing us 5 reputation points in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#4 Full name change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, PayPal allows users to only change 1-2 letters of their name once (usually because of typos). After that, the option to update your name disappears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, using the current version of PayPal.com, the CyberNews research team was able to change a test account’s name from “Tester IAmTester” to “christin christina”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/name-change.png&quot; alt=&quot;It was pretty easy to change our test account's name, bypassing PayPal's name change security&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1932&quot; width=&quot;845&quot; height=&quot;183&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/name-change.png 1127w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/name-change-300x65.png 300w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/name-change-1024x222.png 1024w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/name-change-768x166.png 768w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/name-change-750x162.png 750w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How we did it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered that if we capture the requests and repeat it every time by changing 1-2 letters at a time, we are able to fully change account names to something completely different, without any verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discovered that we can use any unicode symbols, including emojis, in the name field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s the worst case scenario here?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker, armed with stolen PayPal credentials, can change the account holder’s name. Once they’ve completely taken over an account, the real account holder wouldn’t be able to claim that account, since the name has been changed and their official documents would be of no assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PayPal’s response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue was deemed a &lt;strong&gt;Duplicate&lt;/strong&gt; by PayPal, since it had been apparently discovered by another researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#5 The self-help SmartChat stored XSS vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal’s self-help chat, which it calls SmartChat, lets users find answers to the most common questions. Our research discovered that this SmartChat integration is missing crucial form validation that checks the text that a person writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3-1024x576.png&quot; alt=&quot;PayPal's SmartChat stored XSS vulnerability &quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1935&quot; width=&quot;768&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3-300x169.png 300w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3-768x432.png 768w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3-750x422.png 750w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3-1140x641.png 1140w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/image3.png 1920w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How we did it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the validation is done at the front end, we were able to use a man in the middle (MITM) proxy to capture the traffic that was going to Paypal servers and attach our malicious payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s the worst case scenario here?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can write malicious code into the chatbox and PayPal’s system would execute it. Using the right payload, a scammer can capture customer support agent session cookies and access their account. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, the scammer can log into their account, pretend to be a customer support agent, and get sensitive information from PayPal users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PayPal’s response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day that we informed PayPal of this issue, they replied that since it isn’t “exploitable externally,” it is a non-issue. However, while we planned to send them a full POC (proof of concept), PayPal seems to have removed the file on which the exploit was based. This indicates that they were not honest with us and patched the problem quietly themselves, providing us with no credit, thanks, or bounty. Instead, they closed this as &lt;strong&gt;Not Applicable&lt;/strong&gt;, costing us another 5 points in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#6 Security questions persistent XSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is similar to the one above (#5), since PayPal does not sanitize its Security Questions input. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How we did it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because PayPal’s Security Questions input box is not validated properly, we were able to use the MITM method described above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot that shows our test code being injected to the account after refresh, resulting in a massive clickable link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/persistent-xss.png&quot; alt=&quot;PayPal's security questions persistent XSS&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1936&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/persistent-xss.png 940w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/persistent-xss-300x169.png 300w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/persistent-xss-768x432.png 768w, https://cybernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/persistent-xss-750x422.png 750w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s the worst case scenario here?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attackers can inject scripts to other people’s accounts to grab sensitive data. By using Vulnerability #1 and logging in to a user’s account, a scammer can inject code that can later run on any computer once a victim logs into their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showing a fake pop up that could say “Download the new PayPal app” which could actually be malware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing the text user is adding. For example, the scammer can alter the email where the money is being sent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keylogging credit card information when the user inputs it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many more ways to use this vulnerability and, like all of these exploits, it’s only limited by the scammer’s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PayPal’s response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day we reported this issue, PayPal responded that it had already been reported. Also on the same day, the vulnerability seems to have been patched on PayPal’s side. They deemed this issue a &lt;strong&gt;Duplicate&lt;/strong&gt;, and we lost another 5 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PayPal’s reputation for dishonesty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal has been on the receiving end of criticism for not honoring its own bug bounty program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most ethical hackers will remember the 2013 case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/05/29/paypal-refuses-to-pay-bug-finding-teen/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;Robert Kugler&lt;/a&gt;, the 17-year old German student who was shafted out of a huge bounty after he discovered a critical bug on PayPal’s site. Kugler notified PayPal of the vulnerability on May 19, but apparently PayPal told him that because he was under 18, he was ineligible for the Bug Bounty Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to PayPal, the bug had already been discovered by someone else, but they also admitted that the young hacker was just too young. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20121021222451/http://l8security.com/post/33876600904/paypal-bug-bounty-a-lesson-in-not-being-a-fuckup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;Another researcher&lt;/a&gt; earlier discovered that attempting to communicate serious vulnerabilities in PayPal’s software led to long delays. At the end, and frustrated, the researcher promises to never waste his time with PayPal again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the case of another teenager, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/08/paypal-2fa-is-easily-bypassed-teenage-white-hat-hacker-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;Joshua Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, also 17 at the time, who said that he was able to easily bypass PayPal’s 2FA. He went on to state, however, that PayPal didn’t respond after multiple attempts at communicating the issue with them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal acknowledged and downplayed the vulnerability, later patching it, without offering any thanks to Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The big problem with HackerOne&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HackerOne is often hailed as a godsend for ethical hackers, allowing companies to get novel ways to patch up their tools, and allowing hackers to get paid for finding those vulnerabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly the most popular, especially since big names like PayPal work exclusively with the platform. There have been issues with HackerOne’s response, including the huge scandal involving Valve, when a researcher was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-publishes-second-steam-zero-day-after-getting-banned-on-valves-bug-bounty-program/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;banned from HackerOne&lt;/a&gt; after trying to report a Steam zero-day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, its Triage system, which is often seen as an innovation, actually has a serious problem. The way that HackerOne’s triage system works is simple: instead of bothering the vendor (HackerOne’s customer) with each reported vulnerability, they’ve set up a system where HackerOne Security Analysts will quickly check and categorize each reported issue and escalate or close the issues as needed. This is similar to the triage system in hospitals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Security Analysts are able to identify the problem, try to replicate it, and communicate with the vendor to work on a fix. However, there’s one big flaw here: these Security Analysts are also active Bug Bounty Hackers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, these Security Analysts get first dibs on reported vulnerabilities. They have full discretion on the type of severity of the issue, and they have the power to escalate, delay or close the issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That presents a huge opportunity for them, if they act in bad faith. Other criticisms have pointed out that Security Analysts can first delay the reported vulnerability, report it themselves on a different bug bounty platform, collect the bounty (without disclosing it of course), and then closing the reported issue as &lt;strong&gt;Not Applicable&lt;/strong&gt;, or perhaps &lt;strong&gt;Duplicate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the system is ripe for abuse, especially since Security Analysts on HackerOne use generic usernames, meaning that there’s no real way of knowing what they are doing on other bug bounty platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What it all means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the exact “Who is to blame” question is left unanswered at this point, because it is overshadowed by another bigger question: why are these services so irresponsible?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s point out a simple combination of vulnerabilities that any malicious actor can use:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy PayPal accounts on the black market for pennies on the dollar. (On this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackpasqk3nqfuc.onion/paypal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot; (opens in a new tab)&quot;&gt;.onion website&lt;/a&gt;, you can buy a $5,000 PayPal account for just $150, giving you a 3,333% ROI.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability #1&lt;/strong&gt; to bypass the two-factor authentication easily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability #3&lt;/strong&gt; to bypass the sending money security and easily send money from the linked bank accounts and cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the scammer can use &lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability #1&lt;/strong&gt; to bypass 2FA and then use &lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability #4&lt;/strong&gt; to change the account holder’s name. That way, the scammer can lock the original owner out of their own account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are just two simple ways to use our discovered vulnerabilities, scammers – who have much more motivation and creativity for maliciousness (as well as a penchant for scalable attacks) – will most likely have many more ways to use these exploits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, to PayPal and HackerOne, these are non-issues. Even worse, it seems that you’ll just get punished for reporting it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Iran lawmaker says 50 dead from coronavirus in city of Qom</title>
<link>https://apnews.com/32540d09ec101aac057660ef1b0aa970</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://apnews.com/32540d09ec101aac057660ef1b0aa970</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s government said Monday that 12 people had died nationwide from the new coronavirus, rejecting claims of a much higher death toll by a lawmaker from the city of Qom that has been at the epicenter of the virus in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;The conflicting reports raised questions about the Iranian government’s transparency concerning the scale of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Five neighboring countries reported their first cases of the virus, with those infected all having links to Iran, including direct travel from a city where authorities have not even reported a confirmed case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Iran’s Health Ministry said the total number of infections have risen to 61 while deaths stood at 12. But a lawmaker from Qom, Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani, was quoted by the semi-official ILNA news agency as saying that the death toll was 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Even with the lower toll of 12, the number of deaths compared to the number of confirmed infections from the virus is higher in Iran than in any other country, including China and South Korea, where the outbreak is far more widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;The World Health Organization said last week that in 2% of infected cases, the virus has been fatal. In Iran, according to the Health Ministry’s figures, the death toll represents nearly 20% of total infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;There are concerns that clusters of the new coronavirus in Iran, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Authorities in Iraq and Afghanistan, which closed their borders with Iran, announced their first confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday. Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman also announced their first cases. In all five countries, the infected patients had links with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Farahani, the lawmaker, said the 50 deaths in Qom date back to Feb. 13. Iran first officially reported cases of the virus and its first deaths on Feb. 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;He did not provide supporting evidence but said more than 250 people are quarantined in Qom, which is known for its Shiite seminaries that attract students from across Iran and other countries. Schools there have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;“I think the performance of the administration in controlling the virus has not been successful,” Farahani said, referring to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. His comments represent the most public criticism levied yet against the government for its handling of the virus, which originated in China in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;“None of the nurses have access to proper protective gear,” Farahani said, adding that some health care specialists had left the city. “So far, I have not seen any particular action to confront corona by the administration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;He spoke following a session in parliament in Tehran. His comments, first published by ILNA, were later carried by other news agencies in Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;While such harsh criticism is rare in the country, it reflects deep public mistrust of the government, particularly since a Ukrainian passenger jet was shot down by Iran on Jan. 8, killing 176 on board amid heightened tensions with the U.S. Iranian government officials at first tried to conceal the cause of the crash before acknowledging that Revolutionary Guard forces had shot it down, mistaking it for an enemy target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Health Ministry spokesman Iraj Harirchi rejected the lawmaker’s comments, but said about 900 other suspected cases are being tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;“No one is qualified to discuss this sort of news at all,” Harirchi said, adding that lawmakers have no access to coronavirus statistics and could be mixing figures on deaths related to other diseases like the flu with the new virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Mohammad Tavakoli, a representative of the health minister in Qom, said 320 people suspected to have the infection have been hospitalized, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. He added that 21 people who had been infected had recovered and were released from hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Asked about the spike in cases in Iran, WHO’s emergencies program director Michael Ryan cautioned that in the first wave reported from a country, only the deaths may be being picked up and therefore are over-represented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;“The virus may have been there for longer than we had previously suspected,” Ryan said. “Sometimes when you see an acceleration of cases and a spread from that, it doesn’t necessarily represent the natural transmission dynamics of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;He added that it is “very much driven by the context,” such as whether there’s been a religious gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;The virus, which causes the COVID-19 illness, has infected more than 79,000 people globally, and caused more than 2,600 deaths, most of them in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Ian Mackay, who studies viruses at Australia’s University of Queensland said the latest figures reported mean that “Iran could become the hot spot for seeding countries that have travel with Iran ... a source outside of China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Travelers from Iran with the virus have been confirmed in Canada, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;The outbreak of the virus in Iran comes as its economy buckles under pressure from U.S. economic sanctions. The virus threatens to isolate Iran even further as several countries began halting flights and barring Iranians from entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;The head of the WHO expressed concern over the virus’ spread in Iran, as well as in Italy where more than 200 have tested positive and five have died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;“The past few weeks has demonstrated just how quickly a new virus can spread around the world and cause widespread fear and disruption,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Ryan said a team from WHO would arrive in Iran on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;The outbreak in Iran has centered mostly in the city of Qom, but spread rapidly in recent days as Iranians voted Friday in a parliamentary election. Many people wore masks and stocked up on hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Iranian health officials have not said whether health workers in Qom who first came in contact with infected people had taken precautions. Iran also has not said how many people are quarantined overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;To prevent the spread of the virus, schools across much of the country were closed for a second day. Soccer matches and movie screenings have been suspended. Tehran’s metro, which is used by about 3 million people in the capital, and public buses are being sanitized daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Iran has confirmed cases in five cities, including Tehran. A local mayor in Tehran is among those quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;While Iran has not reported any cases in its northeastern city of Mashhad, authorities in Kuwait on Monday said three travelers returning from there had tested positive for the virus, raising more questions about the Iranian government response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Iraq said the virus was confirmed in a 22-year-old Iranian student in Najaf, home to Shiite seminaries and shrines. Separately, a person in Afghanistan’s western province of Herat who had returned from Iran tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Bahrain’s Health Ministry said an infected citizen who returned Friday from Iran had transited through the world’s busiest international airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The ministry said the person is a school bus driver, and that students are being checked and related schools will be closed for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Oman said two of its citizens returning from Iran have the virus and are in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Armenia also closed its border with Iran for two weeks and suspended flights between the two countries. Azerbaijan temporarily closed two border checkpoints with Iran. Georgia restricted movement of individuals to and from Iran and halted direct flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Component-root-0-2-76 Component-p-0-2-68&quot;&gt;Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi and Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran; Rahim Faiez and Tameem Akhgar in Kabul, Afghanistan; Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad; Frank Jordans in Berlin; Jan M.

<title>Pwn.college</title>
<link>https://www.pwn.college/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.pwn.college/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to pwn.college BETA!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pwn.college is a first-stage education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. It is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity to becoming a “yellow belt”, able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy of pwn.college is “practice makes perfect”. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the open-source philosophy of “release early, release often”, pwn.college is in BETA. This is not yet a polished education platform, but we’re pushing there! Right now, we are working on resolving the following &lt;strong&gt;known issues&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The module slides are not very useful without video (and demos).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the module challenge sets have problems with difficulty scaling (ROP suffers from this especially).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the module challenge sets are missing concepts (example: GOT overwrites for memory corruption, actual memory corruption in the kernel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have other comments, suggestions, and feedback, please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:pwn.college@asu.edu&quot;&gt;pwn.college@asu.edu&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider hacking as a martial art. Newcomers begin as &lt;em&gt;white belts&lt;/em&gt;, with zero security knowledge. Slowly and painfully, they become &lt;em&gt;yellow belts&lt;/em&gt;, able to reason about simple security challenges. Over time, they become more sure in their skills, achieving &lt;em&gt;brown belt&lt;/em&gt; status, before finally graduating to hacking masters: &lt;em&gt;black belts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pwn.college is meant for &lt;strong&gt;white belts&lt;/strong&gt;. If you already know the basics of hacking (and, thus, are a yellow belt), you will find this resource very easy. If you are a brown belt, you will find it quite boring. If you are a black belt, it will put you to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pwn.college was created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://yancomm.net&quot;&gt;Zardus (Yan Shoshitaishvili)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://connornelson.com&quot;&gt;kanak (Connor Nelson)&lt;/a&gt; for the CSE 466 course at Arizona State University. It has powered the Fall 2018 and Fall 2019 editions of CSE466, and is moving forward toward changing the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pwn.college is organized as a set of modules covering different topics. Each module has a set of lectures (slides available now, videos coming soon!) and practice problems, auto-generated for each aspiring hacker to practice on. Challenges come in a &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; variety, which will walk you through their own solutions, and a &lt;em&gt;testing&lt;/em&gt; variety, which will challenge you with less guidance. Challenges are run directly on pwn.college, and can be launched in &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; mode, where you have root access but there is a fake flag, and &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; mode, where you cannot read the flag without exploiting the challenge. The following modules are currently available at pwn.college:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from directed module, pwn.college contains a wiki-like set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pwn.college/concepts&quot;&gt;hacking concepts&lt;/a&gt;! These are designed to be linked directly from challenge problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you learn the basics of cybersecurity and achieve yellow belt status, you should move on to harder challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capture The Flags (CTFs) are a great way to practice your hacking skills in a fun and ethical way. The most popular way to find upcoming events is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ctftime.org&quot;&gt;https://ctftime.org&lt;/a&gt;. If you are at ASU, feel free to check out and join ASU’s CTF Team &lt;em&gt;pwndevils&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pwndevils.com&quot;&gt;https://pwndevils.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wargames are another great way to practice your hacking skills. Whereas CTFs are short (normally 48 hour) events, wargames are not time-based. You can find a list of wargames at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus&quot;&gt;https://github.com/zardus/wargame-nexus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pwn-college/pwn-college&quot;&gt;infrastructure powering pwn.college&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pwn-college/pwn-college.github.io&quot;&gt;the web-facing content&lt;/a&gt; are open source, and we welcome pull requests and issues. The modules are closed-source, because they include source code and solution scripts. If you are an educator, or otherwise someone we trust, and are interested in collaborating on the modules themselves, please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:pwn-college@asu.edu&quot;&gt;pwn-college@asu.edu&lt;/a&gt;.
