<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/images/google-widevine-gmail.png&quot; alt=&quot;I'm sorry but we're not supporting an open source solution like this&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 4 months of waiting, that is the response I got from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.widevine.com/&quot;&gt;Widevine&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s DRM for web browsers. For the last 2 years I’ve been working on a web browser that now cannot be completed because Google, the creators of the &lt;em&gt;open source&lt;/em&gt; browser Chrome, won’t allow DRM in an &lt;em&gt;open source&lt;/em&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser I’m building, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream&quot;&gt;Metastream&lt;/a&gt;, is an Electron-based (Chromium derived), MIT-licensed browser hosted on GitHub. Its main feature is the ability to playback videos on the web, synchronized with other peers. Each client runs its own instance of the Metastream browser and transmits playback information to keep them in sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone is creating a browser that wants to playback media, they’ll soon discover the requirement of DRM for larger web media services such as Netflix and Hulu. There are a few DRM providers for the web including Widevine, PlayReady, and FairPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m aware, Widevine is the only available DRM for a Chromium-based browser, especially so for Electron. Chromium accounts for roughly &lt;strong&gt;70% market share&lt;/strong&gt; of all web browsers, soon to include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-building-chromium-powered-web-browser-windows-10&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s upcoming Edge browser rewrite&lt;/a&gt;. Waiting 4 months for a minimal response from a vendor with such a large percentage of the market is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t something I’m alone in either, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12427&quot;&gt;several Electron users&lt;/a&gt; have waited months for a response. More prominently, the creators of Brave Browser also had &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/10449#issuecomment-323800130&quot;&gt;issues waiting for replies from Google Widevine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is a prime example for why free as in beer is not enough. Small share browsers are at the mercy of Google, and Google is stalling us for no communicated-to-us reason.” - Brian Bondy, Co-founder &amp;amp; CTO of Brave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m now only left with two options regarding the fate of Metastream: stop development of a desktop browser version, or pivot my project to a browser extension with reduced features. The latter requiring publishing to the Google Chrome Web Store which would further entrench the project into a Google walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's only April, and 2019 has already been an absolutely brutal year for Google's product portfolio. The Chromecast Audio &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-kills-the-chromecast-audio/&quot;&gt;was discontinued January 11&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube annotations were &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2683267&quot;&gt;removed and deleted&lt;/a&gt; January 15. Google Fiber &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/google-fiber-exits-louisville-after-shoddy-installs-left-exposed-wires-in-roads/&quot;&gt;packed up and left&lt;/a&gt; a Fiber city on February 8. Android Things &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/android-things-is-no-longer-for-things-focuses-on-smart-speakers-and-displays/&quot;&gt;dropped IoT support&lt;/a&gt; on February 13. Google's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/google-hardware-makes-cuts-to-laptop-and-tablet-development-cancels-products/&quot;&gt;laptop and tablet division&lt;/a&gt; was reportedly slashed on March 12. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/google-promises-to-shut-down-two-of-its-seven-messaging-apps/&quot;&gt;Google Allo&lt;/a&gt; shut down on March 13. The &quot;Spotlight Stories&quot; VR studio &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/google-spotlight-stories-shutting-down-1203163117/&quot;&gt;closed its doors&lt;/a&gt; on March 14. The goo.gl URL shortener &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/transitioning-google-url-shortener.html&quot;&gt;was cut off from new users&lt;/a&gt; on March 30. Gmail's &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020249393-Important-update-about-Gmail-on-IFTTT&quot;&gt;IFTTT support&lt;/a&gt; stopped working March 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today, April 2, we're having a Google Funeral double-header: both &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-shuts-down-april-2-all-data-will-be-deleted/&quot;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; (for consumers) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/google-kills-google-inbox/&quot;&gt;Google Inbox&lt;/a&gt; are being laid to rest. Later this year, Google Hangouts &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RonAmadeo/status/1070755806264610820&quot;&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;&quot; will &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/the-great-google-hangouts-shutdown-begins-october-2019/&quot;&gt;start to wind down,&lt;/a&gt; and somehow also scheduled for 2019 is Google Music's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/youtube-music-will-replace-google-play-music-but-wont-kill-user-uploads/&quot;&gt;&quot;migration&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to YouTube Music, with the Google service being put on death row sometime afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are 91 days into the year, and so far, Google is racking up an unprecedented body count. If we just take the official shutdown dates that have already occurred in 2019, a Google-branded product, feature, or service has died, on average, about every nine days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these product shutdowns have transition plans, and some of them (like Google+) represent Google completely abandoning a user base. The specifics aren't crucial, though. What matters is that every single one of these actions has a negative consequence for Google's brand, and the near-constant stream of shutdown announcements makes Google seem more unstable and untrustworthy than it has ever been. Yes, there was the one time Google killed Google Wave &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/08/wave-cancellation-google-gives-up-on-next-gen-messaging/&quot;&gt;nine years ago&lt;/a&gt; or when it took Google Reader away &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/06/its-time-to-say-goodbye-to-google-reader-and-hello-to-something-new/&quot;&gt;six years ago,&lt;/a&gt; but things were never this bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while there has been a subset of people concerned about Google's privacy and antitrust issues, but now Google is eroding trust that &lt;em&gt;its existing customers&lt;/em&gt; have in the company. That's a huge problem. Google has significantly harmed its brand over the last few months, and I'm not even sure the company realizes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google products &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; trust and investment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;377&quot; data-width=&quot;1500&quot; alt=&quot;The latest batch of dead and dying Google apps. &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26-1-640x161.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;161&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26-1-1280x322.jpg 2x&quot; alt=&quot;The latest batch of dead and dying Google apps. &quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/26-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;377&quot; data-width=&quot;1500&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; The latest batch of dead and dying Google apps.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is a platform company. Be it cloud compute, app and extension ecosystems, developer APIs, advertising solutions, operating-system pre-installs, or the storage of user data, Google constantly asks for investment from consumers, developers, and partner companies in the things it builds. Any successful platform will pretty much require trust and buy-in from these groups. These groups need to feel the platform they invest in today will be there tomorrow, or they'll move on to something else. If any of these groups loses faith in Google, it could have disastrous effects for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers want to know the photos, videos, and emails they upload to Google will stick around. If you buy a Chromecast or Google Home, you need to know the servers and ecosystems they depend on will continue to work, so they don't turn into fancy paperweights tomorrow. If you take the time to move yourself, your friends, and your family to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/google-allo-is-incomplete-but-assistant-is-the-companys-future/&quot;&gt;a new messaging service&lt;/a&gt;, you need to know it won't be &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/google-gives-up-on-google-allo-hopes-carriers-will-sort-out-rcs-messaging/&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; two years later. If you begrudgingly join a new social network that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/youtube-tries-to-stem-the-flow-of-a-new-kind-of-terrible-comments/&quot;&gt;forced down your throat&lt;/a&gt;, you need to know it won't &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/google-exposed-non-public-data-for-500k-users-then-kept-it-quiet/&quot;&gt;leak your data&lt;/a&gt; everywhere, shut down, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-shuts-down-april-2-all-data-will-be-deleted/&quot;&gt;delete all your posts&lt;/a&gt; a few years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also enterprise customers, who, above all, like safe bets with established companies. The old adage of &quot;Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM&quot; is partly a reference for the enterprise's desire for a stable, steady, reliable tech partner. Google is trying to tackle this same market with its paid G Suite program, but the most it can do in terms of stability is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/whatsnew/calendar/&quot;&gt;post a calendar&lt;/a&gt; detailing the rollercoaster of consumer-oriented changes coming down the pipeline. There's a slower &quot;Scheduled release track&quot; that delays the rollout of some features, but things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/gmail-coms-massive-redesign-launches-today/&quot;&gt;a complete revamp&lt;/a&gt; of Gmail eventually all still arrive. G Suite has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/user_features.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Core Services&quot;&lt;/a&gt; list meant to show confidence in certain products sticking around, but some of the entries there, like Hangouts and Google Talk, still get shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related-stories right&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;subheading notched&quot;&gt;Google kills product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;read-more&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;recommendation-series&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/&quot;&gt;View more stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
Developers gamble on a platform's stability even more than consumers do. Consumers might trust a service with their data or spend money on hardware, but developers can spend &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; building an app for a platform. They need to read documentation, set up SDKs, figure out how APIs work, possibly pay developer startup fees, and maybe even learn a new language. They won't do any of this if they don't have faith in the long-term stability of the platform.
&lt;p&gt;Developers can literally build their products around paid-access Google APIs like the Google Maps API, and when Google does things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/&quot;&gt;raise the price&lt;/a&gt; of the Maps API by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inderapotheke.de/blog/farewell-google-maps&quot;&gt;14x for some use cases&lt;/a&gt;, it is incredibly disruptive for those businesses and harmful to Google's brand. When apps like Reddit clients are flagged by Google Play &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/96kpsf/more_issues_with_google_play_suspended_for_hate/&quot;&gt;every other month&lt;/a&gt;&quot; for the crime of displaying user-generated content and when it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/9n88wv/the_future_of_android_development/&quot;&gt;impossible to talk to a human&lt;/a&gt; at Google about anything, developers are less likely to invest in your schizophrenic ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware manufacturers and other company partners need to be able to trust a company, too. Google constantly asks hardware developers to build devices dependent on its services. These are things like Google Assistant-compatible speakers and smart displays, devices with Chromecast built in, and Android and Chrome OS devices. Manufacturers need to know a certain product or feature they are planning to integrate will be around for &lt;em&gt;years, s&lt;/em&gt;ince they need to both commit to a potentially multi-year planning and development cycle, and then it needs to survive long enough for customers to be supported for a few years. Watching Android Things chop off a major segment of its market nine months after launch would certainly make me nervous to develop anything based on Android Things. Imagine the risk Volvo is taking by integrating the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/the-volvo-polestar-2-is-the-first-google-android-car/&quot;&gt;new Android Auto OS&lt;/a&gt; into its upcoming Polestar 2: vehicles need around five years of development time and still need to be supported for several years after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google’s shutdowns cast a shadow over the entire company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many shutdowns, tracking Google's bodycount has become a competitive industry on the Internet. Over on Wikipedia, the list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products#Discontinued_products_and_services&quot;&gt;discontinued Google products and services&lt;/a&gt; is starting to approach the size of the active products and services listed. There are entire sites dedicated to discontinued Google products, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://killedbygoogle.com/&quot;&gt;killedbygoogle.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcemetery.co/&quot;&gt;The Google Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://didgoogleshutdown.com&quot;&gt;didgoogleshutdown.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we're seeing a lot of the consequences of Google's damaged brand in the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/google-jumps-into-gaming-with-google-stadia-streaming-service/&quot;&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt; launch. A game streaming platform from one of the world's largest Internet companies should be grounds for excitement, but instead, the baggage of the Google brand has people asking if they can trust the service to stay running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the endless memes and jokes you'll see in every related comments section, you're starting to see Google skepticism in mainstream reporting, too. Over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/mar/20/google-stadia-what-developers-think-of-the-game-streaming-service&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this line makes the pullquote: &quot;A potentially sticky fact about Google is that the company does have a habit of losing interest in its less successful projects.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/19/google-is-better-positioned-for-cloud-streaming-than-anyone-but-dont-expect-the-world-just-yet&quot;&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt; has a whole section of a report questioning &quot;Google's Commitment.&quot; From a &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/QqG3qdi8NXo?t=1651&quot;&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/a&gt; video: &quot;Google has this reputation for discontinuing services that are often good, out of nowhere.&quot; One of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slashgear.com/google-stadia-5-big-questions-that-still-need-answers-22570811/&quot;&gt;SlashGear's&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Stadia questions that need answers&quot; is &quot;Can I trust you, Google?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chrome_2019-03-28_13-17-02.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot; alt=&quot;Google's Phil Harrison talks about the new Google Stadia controller. &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chrome_2019-03-28_13-17-02-640x360.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chrome_2019-03-28_13-17-02-1280x720.png 2x&quot; alt=&quot;Google's Phil Harrison talks about the new Google Stadia controller. &quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chrome_2019-03-28_13-17-02.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; Google's Phil Harrison talks about the new Google Stadia controller.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite examples came from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-boss-answers-and-dodges-our-questions-1833422137&quot;&gt;Kotaku&lt;/a&gt; interview with Phil Harrison, the leader of Google Stadia. In an audio interview, the site lays this whopper of a question on him: &quot;One of the sentiments we saw in our comments section a lot is that Google has a long history of starting projects and then abandoning them. There's a worry, I think, from users who might think that Google Stadia is a cool platform, but if I'm connecting to this and spending money on this platform, how do I know for sure that Google is still sticking with it for two, three, five years? How can you guys make a commitment that Google will be sticking with this in a way that they haven't stuck with Google+, or Google Hangouts, or Google Fiber, Reader, or all the other things Google has abandoned over the years?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yikes&lt;/em&gt;. Kotaku is totally justified to ask a question like this, but to have one of your new executives face questions of &quot;When will your new product shut down?&quot; must be embarrassing for Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison's response to this question started with a surprisingly honest acknowledgement: &quot;&lt;em&gt;I understand the concern.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Harrison, seemingly, &lt;em&gt;gets it&lt;/em&gt;. He seemingly understands that it's hard to trust Google after so many product shutdowns, and he knows the Stadia team now faces an uphill battle. For the record, Harrison went on to cite Google's sizable investment in the project, saying Stadia was &quot;Not a trivial product&quot; and was a &quot;significant cross-company effort.&quot; (Also for the record: you could say all the same things about Google+ a few years ago, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/06/inside-google-how-the-search-giant-plans-to-go-social/&quot;&gt;literally every Google employee&lt;/a&gt; was paid to work on it. Now it is dead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison and the rest of the Stadia team had nothing to do with the closing of Google Inbox, or the shutdown of Hangouts, or the removal of any other popular Google product. They are still forced to deal with the consequences of being associated with &quot;Google the Product Killer,&quot; though. If Stadia was an Amazon product, I don't think we would see these questions of when it would shut down. Microsoft's game streaming service, Project xCloud, only faces questions about feasibility and appeal, not if Microsoft will get bored in two years and dump the project.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The MacBook keyboard fiasco is way worse than Apple thinks</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-macbook-keyboard-fiasco-is-surely-worse-than-apple-thinks/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple keep insisting that only a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284042/apple-macbook-keyboard-apology-issues-bad-design&quot;&gt;small number of customers have problems&lt;/a&gt;” with the MacBook keyboards. That’s bollocks. This is a huge issue, it’s getting worse not better, and Apple is missing the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that many people simply do not contact Apple when their MacBook keyboards fail. They just live with an S key that stutters or a spacebar that intermittently gives double. Or they just start &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/meabed/status/1111034845042540544&quot;&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kraustifer/status/1111087221086408704&quot;&gt;an&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/farhadino/status/1110985745957830663&quot;&gt;external&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/whalio_p/status/1110979261219913728&quot;&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. Apple never sees these cases, so it never counts in their statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s some anecdata for Apple. I sampled the people at Basecamp. Out of the 47 people using MacBooks at the company, a staggering 30% are dealing with keyboard issues right now!! And that’s just the people dealing with &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; keyboard issues. If you include all the people who used to have issues, but went through a repair or replacement process, the number would be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worth noting here is that the 3rd generation membrane keyboard did nothing to fix the issues. Six out of thirteen – nearly half!! – of the 2018+ MacBooks we have at the company have a failed keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I backed up those figures with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1112804750263693312&quot;&gt;a Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt; that has over 1,500 respondents already. That’s a 60% failure rate!! But Apple is only seeing 11% of those, as the vast majority of customers are simply just living with their broken computer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a disaster. A complete unmitigated disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as always, in a time of crisis, the event itself is less indicative of the health of a company than the response. Is Apple going to accept that they’re currently alienating and undermining decades of goodwill by shipping broken computers in mass quantities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;30&quot;&gt;I'm at my wits end with big tech platforms. I run a popular photography product company (which was a Kickstarter project in 2014) [0] which gets a lot of love for its ability to help photographers take interesting images.
&lt;p&gt;But I'm continually running into walls with BigTechCos. I'm just coming off the end of having had my Instagram account deleted by Facebook because a graffiti artist and his trolls were able to flag my IG account and left me unable to appeal[1]. 20k followers, 4 years of work gone. My entire customer base is primarily on IG and they are shocked to find that I'm not; so I feel the pain every day and the fact that I'm no longer advertising on FB because of it is a loss-loss in my opinion. Can not explain how upsetting it is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury Amazon randomly delisted my product. I randomly received an email that they removed me [2]. I checked the listing and saw that a customer had left a bad review. I went to contact that customer [3] and saw that the seller in that instance wasn't me, it was Adorama, a retailer who sells the product I created. I figured this was the sale that got my account flagged, so I responded trying to explain that I sell an OEM product so I wouldn't sell anything used/broken[4]. They then respond that my response is not sufficient[5]. I then decide to give them what they want, contact my manufacturer, come up with a plan [6]. Pretty long, with evidence, a spreadsheet, and even more detailed notes at the end of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today they've just gotten back to me saying they refuse to reinstate it and that I'm shit out of luck [7]. I am livid at this point. What else did they want? And if they weren't going to reinstate me in the first place, why not just say that? According to my account dashboard my account is in perfect 'health'[8] and there is absolutely no indication that there is anything wrong. I feel like I am being trolled.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reducing notification permission prompt spam in Firefox</title>
<link>https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2019/04/01/reducing-notification-permission-prompt-spam-in-firefox/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2019/04/01/reducing-notification-permission-prompt-spam-in-firefox/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Permission prompts are a common sight on the web today. They allow websites to prompt for access to powerful features when needed, giving users granular and contextual choice about what to allow. The permission model has allowed browsers to ship features that would have presented risks to privacy and security otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, over the last few years the ecosystem has seen a rise in unsolicited, out-of-context permission prompts being put in front of users, particularly ones that ask for permission to send push notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interest of protecting our users and the web platform from this, we plan to experiment with restricting how and when websites can ask for notification permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationalizing Push Notification Permission Spam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push notifications are a powerful capability that enables new kinds of interactions with sites. It is hard to imagine a modern chat or social networking app that doesn’t send notifications. Since notifications can be sent after you leave a site, it is only natural that a site would need to ask for permission to show them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_616&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-616 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://3sgkpvh31s44756j71xlti9b-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-11.00.42-600x247.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Notification Permission Prompt&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-11.00.42-600x247.png 600w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-11.00.42-300x123.png 300w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-11.00.42-768x316.png 768w, https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/files/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-01-at-11.00.42.png 774w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Looks familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/firefox/status/999048466193039361&quot;&gt;anecdotal evidence&lt;/a&gt; tells us that there is an issue with notification permission prompts among our user base. As we browse the web, we regularly encounter these prompts and more often than not we become annoyed at them or don’t understand the intent of the website requesting the permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://telemetry.mozilla.org/new-pipeline/dist.html#!cumulative=0&amp;amp;end_date=2019-01-24&amp;amp;include_spill=0&amp;amp;keys=(all)!web-notifications!webRTC-shareDevices!geolocation&amp;amp;max_channel_version=beta%252F65&amp;amp;measure=POPUP_NOTIFICATION_STATS&amp;amp;min_channel_version=null&amp;amp;processType=*&amp;amp;product=Firefox&amp;amp;sanitize=1&amp;amp;sort_by_value=0&amp;amp;sort_keys=submissions&amp;amp;start_date=2018-12-25&amp;amp;table=0&amp;amp;trim=1&amp;amp;use_submission_date=0&quot;&gt;According to our telemetry data&lt;/a&gt;, the notifications prompt is by far the most frequently shown permission prompt, with about 18 million prompts shown on Firefox Beta in the month from Dec 25 2018 to Jan 24 2019. Not even 3% of these prompts got accepted by users. Most prompts are dismissed, while almost 19% of prompts caused users to leave the site immediately after being confronted with them. This is in stark contrast to the camera/microphone prompt, which has an acceptance rate of about 85%!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to believe that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are websites that show the notification prompt without the intent of using it to enhance the user experience, or that fail to convey this UX enhancement when prompting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are websites that prompt for notification permission “too early”, without giving users enough context or time to decide if they want them, even if push notifications would significantly enhance the user experience on that site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/no-notifications/&quot;&gt;Last year Firefox introduced&lt;/a&gt; a new setting that allows users to entirely opt out of receiving new push notification permission prompts. This feature was well received, among users that discovered it and understood the implications. But we still fail to protect the large part of our users that do not explore their notification settings or don’t want to enforce such drastic measures. Thus, we are starting to explore other methods of preventing “permission spam” with two new experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment 1: Requiring User Interaction for Notification Permission Prompts in Nightly 68&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/49&quot;&gt;frequently discussed mitigation&lt;/a&gt; for this problem is requiring a user gesture, like a click or a keystroke, to trigger the code that requests permission. User interaction is a popular measure because it is often seen as a proxy for user consent and engagement with the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mzl.la/2HHQQ9S&quot;&gt;Firefox Telemetry from pre-release channels&lt;/a&gt; shows that very few websites request push notifications from a user gesture, indicating that this may be too drastic of a measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect that these numbers might not paint a full picture of the resulting user experience, and we would like to get a real world impression of how requiring user interaction for notification permission prompts affects sites in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, we will temporarily &lt;strong&gt;deny requests for permission to use Notifications unless they follow a click or keystroke&lt;/strong&gt; in Firefox Nightly from April 1st to April 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first two weeks of this experiment, Firefox will not show any user-facing notifications when the restriction is applied to a website. In the last two weeks of this experiment, Firefox will show an animated icon in the address bar (where our notification prompt normally would appear) when this restriction is applied. If the user clicks on the icon, they will be presented with the prompt at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_617&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-617 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://3sgkpvh31s44756j71xlti9b-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2019/04/Screen-Recording-2019-04-01-at-11.58.00.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Prototype of new prompt without user interaction&quot; width=&quot;808&quot; height=&quot;392&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Prototype of new prompt without user interaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, we ask our Nightly audience to watch out for any sites that might want to show notifications, but are unable to do so. In such a case, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;amp;component=Site+Identity+and+Permission+Panels&amp;amp;blocked=1536413&quot;&gt;file a new bug on Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;, blocking &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536413&quot;&gt;bug 1536413&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment 2: Collecting Interaction and Environment Data around Permission Prompts from Release Users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suspect that requiring user interaction is not a perfect solution to this problem. To get to a better approach, we need to find out more about how our release user population interacts with permission prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, we are planning to launch a short-running experiment in Firefox Release 67 to gather information about the circumstances in which users interact with permission prompts. Have they been on the site for a long time? Have they rejected a lot of permission prompts before? The goal is to collect a set of possible heuristics for future permission prompt restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, this sort of data collection on a release channel is an exception to the rule, and requires strict data review. The experiment will run for a limited time, with a small percentage of our release user population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications on Developers and User Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web developers should anticipate that Firefox and other browsers may in the future decide to reject a website’s permission request based on automatically determined heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When such an automatic rejection happens, users may be able to revert this decision retroactively. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API/Using_the_Permissions_API#Responding_to_permission_state_changes&quot;&gt;Permissions API&lt;/a&gt; offers an opportunity to monitor changes in permission state to handle this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general principle, prompting for permissions should be done based on user interaction. Offering your users additional context, and delaying the prompt until the user chooses to show it, will not only future-proof your site, but likely also increase your user engagement and prompt acceptance rates.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>French ISPs Ordered to Block Sci-Hub and LibGen</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/court-orders-french-isps-to-block-sci-hub-and-libgen-190331/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/court-orders-french-isps-to-block-sci-hub-and-libgen-190331/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-148552&quot; src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;281&quot;/&gt;By offering free access to millions of ‘paywalled’ research papers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sci-hub.tw/&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub&lt;/a&gt; is often described as “The Pirate Bay of Science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is used by researchers from all over the world, to access papers they otherwise have a hard time accessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic publishers are not happy with the service. They see the site as a threat to their multi-billion dollar businesses and have tried to shut it down through several &lt;a href=&quot;http://torrentfreak.com/elsevier-cracks-down-on-pirated-scientific-articles-150609/&quot;&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sci-Hub lost its US court battles against Elsevier and the American Chemical Society, the site didn’t fold. Instead, all the media attention only appeared to make the site even more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This left the publishers with few other options than to have the site blocked by ISPs.  This previously happened &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/bahnhof-the-isp-that-fights-for-privacy-and-a-free-internet-181225/&quot;&gt;in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, for example, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-pirate-bay-of-science-blocked-in-russia-over-medical-studies-181130/&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. This month France joins the list following an order from the High Court of Paris, which also targets several Library Genesis (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis&quot;&gt;LibGen&lt;/a&gt;) domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a complaint from academic publishers Elsevier and Springer Nature, Internet providers Bouygues, Free, Orange, and SFR have been ordered to block access to Sci-Hub and LibGen sites for the year to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its decision, picked up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextinpact.com/news/107689-les-principaux-fai-francais-doivent-bloquer-sci-hub-et-libgen.htm&quot;&gt;Next INpact&lt;/a&gt;, the French court ruled that the two sites “clearly claim to be pirate platforms rejecting the principle of copyright and bypassing publishers’ subscription access portals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan, who had no say in the matter, is disappointed with the outcome. While she believes that the blockade will have “some effect,” those who are determined to access it still have plenty of options to bypass it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The blockade will have some effect, though not very profound. The people who are using Sci-Hub because they need access to research can still unblock it using VPN, TOR and etc,” Elbakyan informs TorrentFreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court order targets a total of 57 domain names, including various mirror sites. The academic publishers had asked the court for a more flexible blocklist, which they could update whenever new domains would become available, but this was denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the publishers want to expand the blocklist, they will have to go back to court. This ensures that there remains judicial oversight over local website blockades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a request for a specific IP-address block was denied. The court sided with the ISPs, who argued that they should have the freedom to choose their own blocking method, including DNS blocking. That does mean, however, that the ISPs will also have to bear the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub’s founder is not happy with yet another blockade but also highlights a positive note. The verdict made “Sci-Hub” a trending topic in France, which has made even more people aware of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Elbakyan &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub/status/1111971409226592257&quot;&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; that there should be no mechanism for courts or governments to mandate website blockades, particularly against a site that provides free access to research, which is used by some of the smartest people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s interesting that, although many French researchers are using Sci-Hub and see nothing wrong in it, this fact doesn’t affect law and court decisions, which is somehow fundamentally wrong,” Elbakyan tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Researchers are considered to be smartest people, and the government should take their opinion into account – which is not happening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unlikely that France will issue a ban on site-blocking anytime soon, whether it’s research related or not. On the contrary, the Government has plans to expand its site-blocking capabilities in the near future by implementing a national &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/france-plans-to-add-article-13-in-new-anti-piracy-law-this-summer-190329/&quot;&gt;pirate site blocklist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;A copy of the order requiring ISPs to block access to the Sci-Hub and LibGen domains is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/scihuborder.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>French ISPs Ordered to Block Sci-Hub and LibGen - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>The High Court of Paris has ordered several of the largest French ISPs to block access to the pirate libraries LibGen and Sci-Hub. The decision is a setback for the sites that have come under increasing pressure, but Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan believes that determined researchers are smart enough to find an alternative route to her site.</og:description>

<title>Getty Images Sued Again for Trying to License Public Domain Images</title>
<link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190329/15352641901/getty-images-sued-yet-again-trying-to-license-public-domain-images.shtml</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190329/15352641901/getty-images-sued-yet-again-trying-to-license-public-domain-images.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;this-keeps-happening&lt;/em&gt; dept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2016, we wrote about two separate lawsuits involving claims that Getty Images was selling &quot;licenses&quot; to images it had no rights to sell licenses to. The first one was brought by photographer Carol Highsmith, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160727/11243335088/photographer-sues-getty-images-1-billion-claiming-copyright-photos-she-donated-to-public.shtml&quot;&gt;sued Getty&lt;/a&gt; after Getty had &lt;strong&gt;sent a demand letter&lt;/strong&gt; to her over her own images, which she had donated to the Library of Congress to be put into the public domain. That lawsuit mostly flopped when Getty pointed out (correctly) that Highsmith had no standing, seeing as she had given up the copyright in the photos. The second lawsuit was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160804/11403535157/getty-sued-again-over-abusing-copyright-law-licensing-images-it-has-no-rights-to.shtml&quot;&gt;even more bizarre&lt;/a&gt;, involving questions about Getty's rights to various collections it licensed, and whether it had changed the metadata on photos from photo agency Zuma Press. At the time, we noted that little in that lawsuit seemed to make sense, but it still went on for over two years before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bna.com/getty-images-defeats-n73014483037/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Getty prevailed&lt;/a&gt;, and basically said the only mistakes were done by Zuma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now we've got another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5784233-Gov-Uscourts-Wawd-270868-1-0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lawsuit against Getty&lt;/a&gt; over allegedly licensing public domain images. This one was brought by CixxFive Concepts, and... also seems to be a stretch. How much of a stretch? Well, it starts out by alleging RICO violations, and as Ken &quot;Popehat&quot; White always likes to remind everyone: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.popehat.com/2016/06/14/lawsplainer-its-not-rico-dammit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IT'S NOT RICO, DAMMIT&lt;/a&gt;. This lawsuit is also not RICO and it's not likely to get very far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a lawsuit brought by CixxFive, on behalf of itself and others similarly situated, alleging RICO, Washington Consumer Protection Act, and other claims against Defendants for fraudulently claiming ownership of copyrights in public domain images (which no one owns) and selling fictitious copyright licenses for public domain images (which no one can legally sell), including operating an enterprise of third-party contributors to perpetrate this egregious scheme.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing, though: you can still sell public domain images. You can do whatever you want with them. Of course, you can't sue over &lt;em&gt;infringement&lt;/em&gt; of them, but you can most certainly still sell them. Why do you think book publishers still make a ton of money selling the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, CixxFive correctly notes that Getty has NASA images in its database, and those are very clearly in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among the images that Getty and/or Getty US licenses are hundreds of thousands to millions of photographs that are in the public domain, including NASA images, White House press images, historical paintings and documents, and photographs that have been donated to the public domain by the authors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example, Getty and/or Getty US offers to let the user “Purchase a license” to a NASA photo of Saturn for $499.00 with “standard editorial rights” “or just $475.00 with an UltraPack,” which is a five (5) pack of assets for $2,250.00.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may be &lt;em&gt;sleazy&lt;/em&gt;, it is hardly against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These images are in the public domain. No one is required to pay Getty and/or Getty US a penny to copy and use them. And Getty has no right to sell copyright licenses for them, as it has done and is doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sentence is true, the second, not so much. Well, it can't sell &quot;copyright licenses,&quot; as that is a misrepresentation over the rights that Getty Images has -- but if it wants to try to get people to pay for stuff that is otherwise available for free, that's Getty's prerogative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of the lawsuit that I don't think will work, but is at least somewhat interesting, is the argument that this is somehow an unfair or deceptive practice. That's moderately more compelling than the RICO claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;50&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One aspect of the deceptive nature of Getty’s and/or Getty US’s licensing scheme is that Getty and/or Getty US claims copyright on all of the content on its website. For example, the bottom of each page of its website states: “All contents © copyright 1999-2019 Getty Images. All rights reserved.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also, specific public domain images are overlaid on Getty and/or Getty US’s website with the © symbol followed by an entity or contributor name, indicating that the image is protected by copyright. The same © symbol and information is also provided next to the public domain image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getty’s and/or Getty US’s website terms agreement also states as follows: “Unless otherwise indicated, all of the content featured or displayed on the Site, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, photographic images, moving images, sound, illustrations, software, and the selection and arrangement thereof (“Getty Images Content”), is owned by Getty Images, its licensors, or its third-party image partners.”4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getty’s and/or Getty US’s website terms agreement further states as follows: “All elements of the Site, including the Getty Images Content, are protected by copyright, trade dress, moral rights, trademark and other laws relating to the protection of intellectual property.”5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getty’s and/or Getty US’s Content License Agreement also states, under the heading “Intellectual Property Rights,” as follows: “Who owns the content? All of the licensed content is owned by either Getty Images or its content suppliers.”6 (emphasis in original)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That part is at least a bit more compelling, but I'm not sure why CixxFive has standing to sue over that. It seems more like something the FTC or state Attorneys General could go after instead. CixxFive argues that it has standing to sue because it licensed some of these public domain images. But.. that seems to be on CixxFive. If it didn't do the research to discover that those pictures were available totally free elsewhere, it's not clear how that's Getty's fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also points to Getty's infamous copyright trolling practices via its subsidiary License Compliance Services (LCS), but never actually shows that LCS has threatened anyone over the use of public domain material... other than raising the issue of Carol Highsmith, whose lawsuit we mentioned above, and which got thrown out of court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm certainly sensitive to the slimy practices of Getty Images, and claiming that public domain images are available for license (at very high fees) is very slimy. But it's not at all clear that it's against the law. And it's &lt;strong&gt;certainly&lt;/strong&gt; not RICO (dammit).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>OKRs Aren&amp;#039;t Going to Fix Your Communication Issues</title>
<link>http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/29/okrs-arent-going-to-fix-your-communication/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/29/okrs-arent-going-to-fix-your-communication/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Talking with a startup a few days ago they asked for my opinions on OKRs. I have slightly mixed opinions on them overall and started to disclose some of those. Though in sharing some of this I had a few immediate realizations that might be broadly applicable. The crux of his question was, at what stage should we put them in place. I’ve seen a few companies try to put in some form of OKR, and most were met with pretty mixed results. The reason is that OKRs need to change something about your behavior otherwise why put them in place… either change something about the goals you would otherwise have or the methods at which you went about achieving them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping back a bit, my first question and a very focusing question on almost any situation to ask is “What problem are we trying to solve?” In our conversation he actually paused a bit. As he paused a bit longer it was clear that question had not been fully asked or answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most common case I see with startups trying to put in place OKRs, v2moms, management by objectives is that the team is not aligned and focused on the same goals. But my follow-on question is consistently, have you communicated what you decided you goals were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups tend to go through some distinct growing phases. The early stages all the founders are in a room together building out the product. When you get the first few engineers you expand out a little, but still in a single co-working conference room easily. Eventually you need a real office. At the real office stage you start to have an all hands where, this is probably gathered around a large lunch table at first. At all hands no one takes meeting minutes and sends out a recap, instead people take some notes and you assume everyone was present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, at about 20 people you have at least one person that misses the weekly team meeting and misses something key. In a 1:1 you catch it that it was talked about as a priority… but they weren’t there. This very subtle change I’ve seen linger all the way up to a 70/80 person org. I’ve observed management meetings where someone missed and a key member was entirely mis-aligned on what the goals were for months following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a long detour, but the point is that explicit formal communication is a big change for early stage companies. Distributed teams tend to do this better than in person teams, but it is also not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OKRs present a heavy-weight answer to the problem. OKRs tend to require hours and maybe even days to determine what are the right goals and metrics. Even if they are quick, does the process of OKRs change how you structure your team and work significantly for the next few weeks/months. If not, could you much more easily get away with… wait for it… emailing out what the company says priorities are. Email out the meeting notes from your all hands meeting. Email out (gasp) a recap of what you discussed and are thinking about as a management team. Sure every manager could go and have a 1:1 and recap the points for 30 minutes with each of their employees. Or you could use this thing that we’ve had for a little while… email.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I’m only making business card sized games now</title>
<link>http://frankforce.com/?p=5826</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve worked on many games, some big, some small. I’ve found that the smaller the game, the more fun I seem to have making it. So I set out to make the smallest game I possibly could, and it was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the smallest game I’ve ever released. I call it “Tiny Ski!”, and it’s 960 bytes of pure magic. Please watch this short demonstration and continue reading for more info and source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeWdBE82uLw?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tiny Games, Big Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that modern games have become bloated, weighed down by useless features, achievements, anti piracy measures, piles of assets, and other junk. Not only that but developers are constantly taken advantage of, made to crunch for no pay, mass layoffs, etc. Lives have been ruined, and for what? So you could watch your horse poop or play dominoes in an open world game?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote the great Ian Malcolm, “They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be another way. That’s why I say, instead of thinking big, we need to think small. So today, I am proposing a bold new direction. Imagine games so small that you can literally fit one in the palm of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hand.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-5872&quot; srcset=&quot;http://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hand.png 320w, http://frankforce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/hand-300x225.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px&quot;/&gt;Actual Tiny Ski code printed on a business card.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen I give you: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Card Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Also, does my hand look weird?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not the first to create something that touched on this concept. You may have also heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2016-01-12-card/&quot;&gt;Andrew Kensler’s “Business Card Ray Tracer”&lt;/a&gt; Though his work isn’t a game, maybe we can use it as a size guideline for the format: 40 characters wide by 35 characters tall, or 1400 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is of course the &lt;a href=&quot;https://js1k.com&quot;&gt;JS1K competition&lt;/a&gt;, which is has similar restraints but using JavaScript. People have created many amazing works, some of them games. However I don’t believe most of them work as well in this format. First of all the contest provides a shim which sets up the environment and many entries use unicode characters which would not work well in a printable format. That by itself might be ok, but many entries are compressed using a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Siorki/RegPack&quot;&gt;RegPack&lt;/a&gt;, which works almost like zipping a javascript file. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nikhilism.com/post/2012/demystifying-jscrush/&quot;&gt;Nikhil wrote a nice explanation of how it works.&lt;/a&gt; It’s amazing tech but it has the side effect of making the code completely unreadable. I did submit a javascript version of Tiny Ski to the contest though, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://js1k.com/2019-x/demo/4155&quot;&gt;you can play the 1k version of Tiny Ski in your browser.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research to find more past works that fit the bill, but there are surprising few. Of course many smaller games exist in binary format. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64962&quot;&gt;BootChess&lt;/a&gt; for example, a chess game that is only 487 bytes. Of course there are many older roms like Atari 2600 games that are less than 2k. Also there are some really cool 1k intros. However that’s not really what we are looking for here. Only the source code size matters and the final binary will likely end up being much larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tromp.github.io/tetris.html&quot;&gt;Jon Trump’s “An obfuscated tertis”&lt;/a&gt; is nearly small enough as are some other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ioccc.org/&quot;&gt;IOCCC&lt;/a&gt; winners, but usually they are larger then ideal. However they do explore what I believe to be another key component: the code itself should look interesting. Unlike most other games, players are intended to view the actual code. And because the code is so highly compressed into a confusing blob, it’s better to focus on aesthetics over a futile attempt to improve readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first entry into the genera I chose a style of game that I am very familiar with. I’ve programmed variants of ski on many different platforms, starting with the TI-82 when I was in highschool. &lt;a href=&quot;https://killedbyapixel.itch.io/super-aspen&quot;&gt;Last year even released an html5 version called Super Aspen.&lt;/a&gt; For this version, I boiled down the concept down to its essence, hopeful leaving something that is still fun and visually appealing. I even sacrificed some space to make it compile without warnings and work in older versions of visual studio using just a few standard include files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, weighing in at 960 bytes, I present my first entry into the business card game format, “Tiny Ski”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tiny Ski Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Download&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that don’t have access to Visual Studio (or are just lazy), don’t fret! I went to the trouble of building the game for you at no extra charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented move I am also releasing a second example, what may be the worlds smallest FPS in C++. However, this time you’ll have to build it yourself. The full source code below includes a 3D raycasting engine, WASD movement, collision, procedural map generation, some fish, texturing, and distance shading. &lt;em&gt;You can even resize the console window and shrink the font to get a high res image!&lt;/em&gt; Also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw&quot;&gt;OneLoneCoder who has an excellent video explaining how to write a basic raycasting engine&lt;/a&gt; (though my code works differently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Future is Tiny&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only the beginning of our exploration into this new format. There is plenty of room for innovation. I look forward to seeing what you all can come up with! If you made or know of any games with source code that can fit on a business card, please post them below. I’m thinking about setting up a Business Card Game Jam on itch.io later this year, does that sound fun? Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Trains are more efficient and less polluting than other transportation modes</title>
<link>https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/04/rail-transportation-carbon-emissions-green-new-deal/586240/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/04/rail-transportation-carbon-emissions-green-new-deal/586240/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transportation represents a large portion—about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download37.shtml&quot;&gt;29 percent&lt;/a&gt;—of U.S. emissions, and the share has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c2es.org/content/u-s-emissions/&quot;&gt;rising in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. Rail proponents often argue that investment in trains and public transportation is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saveatrain.com/blog/why-choosing-to-travel-by-train-is-environmentally-friendly/&quot;&gt;key part of making transportation cleaner&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed, the Green New Deal calls for greatly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/691997301/rep-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-releases-green-new-deal-outline&quot;&gt;expanding high-speed rail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a &lt;a href=&quot;https://broad.msu.edu/profile/andreash/&quot;&gt;scholar of rail&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s clear to me that the quickest way to decrease greenhouse gases from transportation is to travel by train and move goods by rail instead of on the road or by air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain why, it’s worth comparing rail to other modes of transportation on energy consumption and emissions, and to look at some of the developments that can make rail more widely used in the U.S. and less reliant on fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Energy and emissions profiles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation by rail is a major part of the transportation system in most countries, including in the U.S., which has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aar.org/railroad-101/&quot;&gt;longest freight railway system in the world&lt;/a&gt; with approximately 140,000 miles. Rail passenger services are essential in many areas, primarily in population centers such as New York and Chicago, and intercity rail has a significant market share in some corridors, such as the Northeast. Rail also offers long-distance routes connecting many smaller communities with each other and the large metropolitan areas in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data show that rail has a significantly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/futureofrail/&quot;&gt;lower energy footprint&lt;/a&gt; than trucks and passenger cars. Rail transport, with hard steel wheels on steel rail, has lower resistance to motion than road transportation. And the convoy formation of individual rail cars into trains also adds to its better energy and environmental performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common measure for transportation capacity is ton-miles for freight and passenger-miles for passengers to indicate that a ton of freight is moved for one mile and for passenger systems that a passenger is moved for one mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freight rail accounts for about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bts.gov/topics/national-transportation-statistics&quot;&gt;one-third&lt;/a&gt; of the ton-miles and consumes only about &lt;a href=&quot;https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download37.shtml&quot;&gt;2 percent of the transportation energy&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. The higher efficiency can be illustrated this way: On average, freight railroads move a ton of cargo for around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/AAR-Sustainability-Fact-Sheet-2019.pdf&quot;&gt;479 miles on a gallon of fuel&lt;/a&gt;, which is about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bts.gov/topics/national-transportation-statistics&quot;&gt;11 times more energy-efficient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download37.shtml&quot;&gt;than trucks&lt;/a&gt; on a ton-mile basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passenger rail is around &lt;a href=&quot;https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download37.shtml&quot;&gt;three times more efficient than a car&lt;/a&gt; on a passenger-mile basis at current occupancy levels. The lower energy consumption leads to lower &lt;a href=&quot;https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download37.shtml&quot;&gt;greenhouse emissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How U.S. and European rail differ&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often there is the perception that the U.S. lags behind other countries when it comes to rail, but in many cases that is not true. The country has, arguably, the best freight rail system in the world, which is owned, operated, and financed by private companies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/nationalfactsheets/Amtrak-Corporate-Profile-FY2018-0319.pdf&quot;&gt;Passenger service&lt;/a&gt; in specific corridors is comparable with the European counterparts: for example, in the Northeast. On long-distance routes and in less densely populated areas, however, there are often empty seats on Amtrak trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/04/AP_586842443816/cec0d5c8d.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;The U.S. freight train system is more developed than passenger rail, which is the opposite of Europe. (Nati Harnik/AP)
&lt;p&gt;The primary difference between Europe and North America could be summarized like this: In America there is a freight rail system with some passenger, while in Europe there is a passenger rail system with some freight—the emphasis is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further difference is that the rail network is private in the U.S. and operated to yield a profit, while in most other countries the rail infrastructure is owned by the government (similar to the freeway system in the U.S.) and heavily subsidized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;To compete with air for passenger transportation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running passenger and freight trains on the same lines is possible but poses many challenges, as the characteristics of the two train types are very different; freight trains tend to be long, heavy, and comparatively slow, while passenger trains are short, fast, and comparatively light. If there are not too many trains on a line, this mixed traffic can be managed, but if there are a lot of trains, then separate infrastructure is the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;When journey times are &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=9gdeBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA74&amp;amp;lpg=PA74&amp;amp;dq=train+take+market+share+if+less+than+4h&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=QD16sT14Vu&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U1Tofh3LgQmnLHivwZz5DFfqRyvCQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwimk5-A_ZPhAhWm3oMKHZqqBpoQ6AEwDHoECAkQAQ#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=4h&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;less than four hours&lt;/a&gt;, people usually prefer to travel by train instead of alternative options, such as air or road. For many corridors in the U.S. it would be necessary to upgrade existing lines or to build new infrastructure to achieve competitive journey times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the high-speed rail projects in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsr.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, which the state recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://sf.curbed.com/2019/2/13/18223516/high-speed-rail-newsom-sf-la-canceled-california&quot;&gt;decided to scale back&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.texascentral.com/project/&quot;&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where trains would be able to travel at speeds of 200 miles per hour or more, those states are building new infrastructure. Higher-speed options often allow existing rail tracks to be upgraded to accommodate speeds of around 110 miles per hour to around 125 miles per hour, and such projects are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/intercity/brightline-schedules-first-service/&quot;&gt;implemented in Florida&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://miprc.org/Activities/Current-Activities&quot;&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Routes to better environmental performance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of trains in the U.S. are diesel-electric, where a diesel engine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.railway-technical.com/trains/rolling-stock-index-l/diesel-locomotives/&quot;&gt;runs a generator&lt;/a&gt;, supplying electric traction motors that turn the wheels. However, electricity can also be supplied by the grid to trains via wayside infrastructure, and this option accounts for about 4.5 percent of rail energy, more than for any other mode, with the majority being used in transit and commuter operation, and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://cta.ornl.gov/data/download37.shtml&quot;&gt;intercity rail&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, when the electricity generation mix becomes less greenhouse gas-intensive, those rail systems automatically follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the lines where wayside electrification is not economically feasible—imagine routes that are long, such as Chicago to Los Angeles—or where traffic is relatively low, rail will continue to rely on on-board electric power generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail is developing options to reduce emissions for lines without wayside electrification too, with advanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/intercity/amtrak-begins-power-renewal-orders-75-siemens-chargers-for-long-distance-trains/&quot;&gt;diesel engine technologies&lt;/a&gt;, and exploration of less polluting energy options, including natural gas. Florida East Coast Railway has converted the majority of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railwayage.com/mechanical/locomotives/fec-rolls-out-lng/&quot;&gt;locomotives to liquefied natural gas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having batteries to supply power to trains can significantly reduce or fully avoid conventional wayside electrification, decreasing cost and visual impact as no overhead wires are necessary on the right-of-way. These are suitable for relatively short distances and where power demand is low, such as light rail and streetcars. Detroit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://qlinedetroit.com/ride-guide/faq/&quot;&gt;QLine&lt;/a&gt;, for example, operates 60 percent on battery power, or “off-wire.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Germany has had two hydrogen trains in service since last year.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen fuel cell applications to rail, often referred to as hydrail, enable long range with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/4345/&quot;&gt;lower environmental footprint&lt;/a&gt; than diesel, and such trains for regional passenger service are already in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/coradia-ilint-regional-train/&quot;&gt;operation in Germany&lt;/a&gt;. In the U.S., the technology is being investigated by some passenger and transit railways, including in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statesville.com/news/n-c-plans-shift-to-train-powered-by-hydrogen-fuel/article_f1b01d4c-b077-11e8-9acf-b3af542da3a9.html&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and its use for freight rail is being explored as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without these advances, rail is already more environmentally friendly than road or air. Dramatically expanding rail use, particularly passenger service, will require government investment in more frequent service on existing lines, starting service to areas that don’t have access to rail currently, reducing journey times and building out a larger passenger rail network.&lt;img alt=&quot;The Conversation&quot; src=&quot;https://counter.theconversation.com/content/112128/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
