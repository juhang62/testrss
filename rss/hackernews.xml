&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday ordered two state agencies to investigate a media report that Facebook Inc may be accessing far more personal information from smartphone users, including health and other sensitive data, than had previously been known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directive to New York’s Department of State and Department of Financial Services came after The Wall Street Journal said testing showed that Facebook collected personal information from other apps on users’ smartphones within seconds of them entering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WSJ reported that several apps share sensitive user data including weight, blood pressure and ovulation status with Facebook. The report said that the company can access data in some cases even when the user is not signed into Facebook or does not have a Facebook account. In a statement Cuomo called the practice an “outrageous abuse of privacy.” He also called on the relevant federal regulators to become involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares in Facebook took a short-lived hit after the Wall Street Journal report was published, but closed up 1.2 percent. In late January Cuomo along with New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an investigation into Apple Inc’s failure to warn consumers about a FaceTime bug that had let iPhones users listen to conversations of others who have not yet accepted a video call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is facing a slew of lawsuits and regulatory inquiries over privacy issues, including a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation into disclosures that Facebook inappropriately shared information belonging to 87 million users with British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York’s financial services department does not traditionally supervise social media companies directly, but has waded into digital privacy in the financial sector and could have oversight of some app providers that send user data to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, it is slated to implement the country’s first cybersecurity rules governing state-regulated financial institutions such as banks, insurers and credit monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, DFS said life insurers could use social media posts in underwriting policies, so long as they did not discriminate based on race, colour, national origin, sexual orientation or other protected classes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An update about Redis developments in 2019</title>
<link>http://antirez.com/news/126</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://antirez.com/news/126</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;newslist&quot;&gt;&lt;article data-news-id=&quot;126&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;comment&quot; data-comment-id=&quot;126-&quot; id=&quot;126-&quot; readability=&quot;73.655690765927&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/user/antirez&quot;&gt;antirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2 days ago. 38077 views.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Yesterday a concerned Redis user wrote the following on Hacker News:

— &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19204436&quot;&gt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19204436&lt;/a&gt; —
I love Redis, but I'm a bit skeptical of some of the changes that are currently in development. The respv3 protocol has some features that, while they sound neat, also could significantly complicate client library code. There's also a lot of work going into a granular acl. I can't imagine why this would be necessary, or a higher priority than other changes like multi-thread support, better persistence model, data-types, etc.
— end of user comment —

I’ve the feeling she/he (not sure) is not the only one that looks at ACLs as some sort of feature imposed by the Redis Labs goals, because “enterprise users” or something like that. Also the other points in the comment are interesting, and I believe everything is very well worth addressing in order to communicate clearly with the Redis community what’s the road ahead.

For simplicity I’ll split this blog post into sections addressing every single feature mentioned in the original comment.

## RESP3

The goal of RESP3, as I already blogged in these pages, is to actually simplify the clients landscape. Hopefully every client will have a lower layer that will not try to reinvent some kind of higher level interface: redis.call(“get”,”foo”). There is no longer need to orchestrate conversions because now the protocol is semantical enough to tell the client what a given reply should look like in the hand of the caller, nor any need to know beforehand the command fingerprint for the majority of commands. What I think the user is referring is RESP3 support for out of band communications, that is the reply “attributes”.

I really believe that in the future of Redis “client side caching” will be a big thing. It’s the logical step in every scalable system. However without server assistance client side cache invalidation is a nightmare. This is the reason why RESP3 supports attributes in replies, mainly. However probably Redis 6 *will not implement any of that*. Redis unstable, that will become Redis 6, already has a RESP3 implementation that is almost complete, and there are no attributes. The clients implementing RESP3 can just decide to discard attributes if they are willing to be really future-proof, and likely attributes will not be sent at all anyway even for future Redis versions if the user did not activate some kind of special feature. For instance, for client side caching, the connection will have to be put in some special mode. Moreover, as you know, Redis 6 will be completely backward compatible with RESP2. Actually I’m starting to believe that RESP2 support will never be removed, because it is almost for free, and there is no good reason to break backward compatibility once we did the effort to implement the abstraction layer between RESP2 and RESP3.

Normally I don’t like to change things without a good reason, however RESP2 limitations were having a strong effect on the client ecosystem. I would like to have a client landscape where users, going from one client to the other, will feel at home, and the API will be the Redis API, not the layer that the client author invented. I’m not against an *higher level* API in addition to the lower level one btw, but there should be a common ground, and clients should be able to send commands without knowing anything about such commands.

## ACLs

The ACL specification was redacted by myself four years ago. I waited so much time in order to convince myself this was really the time to implement it: we went a long way without any ACL using just tricks, mainly command renaming. However don’t believe that ACLs main motivation is enterprise customers in need for security. As a side effect, ACLs also allow authentication of users for security purposes, but the main goal of the feature is *operational*.

Let me show you an example. You have a Redis instance and you plan to use the instance to do a new thing: delayed jobs processing. You get a library from the internet, and it looks to work well. Now why on the earth such library, that you don’t know line by line, should be able to call “FLUSHALL” and flush away your database instantly? Maybe the library test will have such command inside and you realize it when it’s too late. Or maybe you just hired a junior developer that is keeping calling “KEYS *” on the Redis instance, while your company Redis policy is “No KEYS command”.

Another scenario, cloud providers: they need to carefully rename the admin commands, and even to mask such commands from being leaked for some reason. More tricks: so MONITOR will not show the commands in the output for instance. With ACLs you can setup Redis so that default users, without some authentication, will be prevented to run anything that is administrative or dangerous. I think this will be a big improvement for operations.

Moreover ACLs is one of the best code I wrote for Redis AFAIK. There is nearly no CPU cost at all, unless you se key patterns, but even so it’s small. The implementation is completely self contained inside the acl.c file, the rest of the core has a handful of calls to the ACL API. No complexity added to the system because it is completely modular. Actually the ACL code allowed to do some good refactoring around the AUTH command.

## Multi threading

There are two possible multi threading supports that Redis could get. I believe the user is referring to “memcached alike” multithreading, that is the ability to scale a single Redis instance to multiple threads in order to increase the operations per second it can deliver in things like GET or SET and other simple commands. This involves making the I/O, command parsing and so forth multi threaded. So let’s call this thing “I/O threading”.

Another multi threaded approach is to, instead, allow slow commands to be executed in a different thread, so that other clients are not blocked. We’ll call this threading model “Slow commands threading”.

Well, that’s the plan: I/O threading is not going to happen in Redis AFAIK, because after much consideration I think it’s a lot of complexity without a good reason. Many Redis setups are network or memory bound actually. Additionally I really believe in a share-nothing setup, so the way I want to scale Redis is by improving the support for multiple Redis instances to be executed in the same host, especially via Redis Cluster. The things that will happen in 2019 about that are two:

A) Redis Cluster multiple instances will be able to orchestrate to make a judicious use of the disk of the local instance, that is, let’s avoid an AOF rewrite at the same time.

B) We are going to ship a Redis Cluster proxy as part of the Redis project, so that users are able to abstract away a cluster without having a good implementation of the Cluster protocol client side.

Another thing to note is that Redis is not Memcached, but, like memcached, is an in-memory system. To make multithreaded an in-memory system like memcached, with a very simple data model, makes a lot of sense. A multi-threaded on-disk store is mandatory. A multi-threaded complex in-memory system is in the middle where things become ugly: Redis clients are not isolated, and data structures are complex. A thread doing LPUSH need to serve other threads doing LPOP. There is less to gain, and a lot of complexity to add.

What instead I *really want* a lot is slow operations threading, and with the Redis modules system we already are in the right direction. However in the future (not sure if in Redis 6 or 7) we’ll get key-level locking in the module system so that threads can completely acquire control of a key to process slow operations. Now modules can implement commands and can create a reply for the client in a completely separated way, but still to access the shared data set a global lock is needed: this will go away.

## Better persistence

Recently we did multiple efforts in order to improve this kind of fundamental functions of Redis. One of the best thing that was implemented lately is the RDB preamble inside the AOF file. Also a lot of work went both in Redis 4 and 5 about replication, that is now completely at another level compared to what it used to be. And yes, it is still one of my main focus to improve such parts.

## Data structures

Now Redis has Streams, starting with Redis 5. For Redis 6 and 7 what is planned is, to start, to make what we have much more memory efficient by changing the implementations of certain things. However to add new data structures there are a lot of considerations to do. It took me years to realize how to fill the gap, with streams, between lists, pub/sub and sorted sets, in the context of time series and streaming. I really want Redis to be a set of orthogonal data structures that the user can put together, and not a set of *tools* that are ready to use. Streams are an abstract log, so I think it’s a very worthwhile addition. However other things I’m not completely sure if they are worth to be inside the core without a very long consideration. Anyway in the latest years there was definitely more stress in adding new data structures. HyperLogLogs, more advanced bit operations, streams, blocking sorted set operations (ZPOP* and BZPOP*), and streams are good examples.

## Conclusions

I believe that the Redis community should be aware about why something is done and why something is instead postponed. I do the error to communicate a lot via Twitter like if everybody is there, but many people happen to have a life :-D and don’t care. The blog is a much better way to inform the community, I need to take the time to blog more. Incidentally I love to write posts, so it’s a win-win. An important thing to realize is that Redis has not a solid roadmap, over the years I found that opportunistic development is a huge win over having a roadmap. Something is demanded? I see the need? I’m in the mood to code it? It’s the right moment because there are no other huge priorities? There are a set of users that are helping the design process, giving hints, ideas, testing stuff? It’s the right moment, let’s do it. To have a solid roadmap for Redis is silly because the size of the OSS core team is small, sometimes I remain stuck with some random crash for weeks… Any fixed long term plan would not work. Moreover as the Redis community gives feedbacks my ideas change a lot, so I would rewrite the roadmap every month. Yet blogging is a good solution to at least show what is the current version of the priorities / ideas, and to show why other ideas were abandoned.

A final note: the level of freedom I've with Redis Labs about what to put inside the open source project side is almost infinite. I think this is kinda of a miracle in the industry, or just the people I work with at Redis Labs are nice folks that understand that what we are doing originated from the open source movement and is wise to keep it going in that way. But it's not a common thing. If I do errors in the Redis roadmap they are surely my errors.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all read those 10x developer articles (I wrote some – guilty as charged!). So if you want to know what you need to work on to improve…well, you have plenty of resources. But I have very seldom come across articles on what NOT to do or how NOT to behave as a developer. And actually, this may be the most important part of the equation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, long overdue, here is what I think is the top list of behaviors you should really work on fast, if you do any of them ;). Why? Well, you might not know it, but your co-workers might hate you for them, as you most likely negatively impact the whole productivity of the team – at the very least!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have one of these developers on your team, it might be worthwhile to share this article in your Slack team channel – just out of general interest, you know 😉!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to prioritize the list from most to least impactful. The goal for me is to start the discussion on the list and prioritize it, too. So please comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Arrogance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the first one, in my mind. You cannot work with a self-absorbed developer. I’ll even go so far as to say:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-click-to-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-ctt-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=As%20long%20as%20you%20are%20willing%20to%20take%20responsibility%20for%20and%20learn%20from%20your%20mistakes%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20a%20bad%20developer.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;As long as you are willing to take responsibility for and learn from your mistakes, you’re not a bad developer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=As%20long%20as%20you%20are%20willing%20to%20take%20responsibility%20for%20and%20learn%20from%20your%20mistakes%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20a%20bad%20developer.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bctt-ctt-btn&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arrogance makes you think that your code is perfect. You may even blame customers for being stupid and for crashing their program rather than reflect on why your software crashed. And that’s how you get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1375&quot; src=&quot;https://anaxi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Bug-everywhere.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;381&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also messy, unreadable code for your teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with arrogance is that it is a behavior that will prevent you from improving. Stop being arrogant, or you’re just a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may already know the Dunning-Kruger effect. We will mention this effect a few times in the list. Here is a graph explaining it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1375&quot; src=&quot;https://anaxi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dunning-Kruger-Effect.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;559&quot; height=&quot;451&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with arrogance is that 1) the developers don’t understand they are on top of the Peak of “Mt. Stupid,” and 2) they will stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sloppiness in the Work Delivered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways developers can show sloppiness in the code they deliver. We all know at least one developer who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;gives cryptic names for variables, or at best not self-explanatory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;puts typos in function names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leaves old, outdated comments in the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shows a poor selection of data types and data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t bother to run the code formatter, despite being told many times to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ignores the IDE warnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copies and pastes StackOverflow code without understanding it or tweaking the solutions to fit their own code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t take the time to document code (nobody wants to read the whole function or file to understand what it does)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t handle errors properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uses excessive dependencies, and updates them without thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t bother to understand the libraries or tools added to the code, potentially leaving glaring issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will always insist on following “best practices” without understanding why those practices are considered “best” (there is no such thing as best practices that adapt to every team)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be such a developer. They annoy the hell out of their colleagues. They slow the whole team’s development process down, requiring their teammates to spend unnecessary time on their code reviews. Their team will dread those code reviews, will grow impatient (we’re still humans), and bugs will get through the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to solve this is for these developers to start to take pride in their work (not to be confused with the arrogance mentioned in point 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Disrespect of Other People’s Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two thing developers hate most are interruptions and unnecessary meetings. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, as meetings are just scheduled interruptions. Developers can’t easily go back to where they were right before an interruption. They need to get into the mindset for development and then slowly trace back to where they left off. And every fellow developer knows that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here are a few ways you can show disrespect to your colleague’s time and productivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;interrupting another developer who is clearly in the zone, for non-important stuff;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;constantly arriving late to meetings, which is a definite choice – whatever anyone says. Either the participants must wait for everyone to be there to start the meeting, or they start without the late developer. In the latter case, he or she will need to be brought up to speed at some point, hence some time lost, and arriving late will disrupt the flow of the meeting in any case;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rambling on and on during meetings. Or, if there are non-coders in the audience, being unwilling to adapt to the audience and wasting time for the entire audience, as any point made will need to be explained again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Constant Negativity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most developers are enthusiastic people, but sometimes you may have the chance (or misfortune) to work with a negative one. Negativity is infectious. If someone complains, it focuses the attention on the negative side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will criticize every choice made: the language, for instance, although, most of the time, those developers are clearly at the top of Mount Stupid (in the Dunning-Kruger Effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t misunderstand me; there should be some criticism in the form of constructive opinions. For example, a Scala developer could talk to a Java developer about promises, saying, “Okay, your language is not as good as mine :P. But you could try CompletableFuture to have a taste of what a monad is. I will show you what you can do with that.” But unfortunately, that kind of friendly attitude is very rare these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Greediness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you have all seen a developer once in a while steal credit for the work produced by a team. This can be done through an email to management, a 1-on-1 talk or another sneaky non-straightforward way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers value competence above all. Taking credit for someone else is taking the other’s competence for yourself and removing it from him or her. This is pretty high up on my list, as I feel it creates a lot of tension and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For greedy developers, such strategies might produce short-term visibility. But in the long run, they will be alienated. Other team members will evolve their communication to highlight their contributions better. After all, there are many ways to give credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Disregard for The Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is done collaboratively with designers, product managers, and other developers. Respecting other people’s input and work is necessary if you don’t want them to go into Hulk mode and flip their desk. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“How” documentation: many programmers comment on every single line of code without describing why it’s doing what it’s doing. If there were a bug in the program and you stumbled across this code, you wouldn’t know where to begin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing an ugly or not-to-the-specs UI “because they’re not a designer”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not mentioning a UX problem to the product manager, because it’s not part of their job. Ignoring the big picture will make the software hard to use, expensive to maintain, and inconsistent with the other components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not trying to understand how design or product decisions are made. And then continuing to ask the same irrelevant questions – and not improving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not considering other team members’ priority dependencies and leaving them stuck in the mud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a new tool/library without warning any teammates. This can cause unforeseen issues down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Lack of Focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering teams solve problems. They use their technical abilities to build features/fix bugs to solve those problems. And some developers just forget about this and will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;philosophize about technical topics instead of focusing on the problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;argue obstinately about technical topics without considering the initial problem (although you do, of course, need to argue when building the solution to the problem)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have lengthy discussions about those technical topics yet rely on their own opinions (instead of facts – facts solve problems, not opinions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With code, sure, you can have several solutions to the same problem, but either it works or it doesn’t; there is no in-between. With focus, you can easily alleviate all uncertainties by trying out code in a sandbox, for instance. But lack of focus wastes the time and productivity of everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Lack of Accountability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, either the code works or it doesn’t…but it needs to work in combination with all the code being added to the codebase by your teammates. Software engineering is probably the most collaborative work in today’s world. Any code you write will interact with that of other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for your team to work well, you need accountability. Sure, code reviews don’t let you get away with anything. But accountability is an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unaccountable developers will, for instance, offer excuses instead of solutions. Those excuses may include time constraints or complexity of the tasks. Nobody wants to hear excuses; they want to understand the steps to be taken toward the solution. Excuses don’t invite others to help or provide a good picture of the task’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my list. Feel free to add more if you think of any, or to suggest a different order of importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you have one on the team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should know is that this means your manager is not doing their job. The issue should have been identified and the problematic developer(s) coached — if they were deemed coachable. The manager should have given warnings and made the hard decision if the bad developers were still impacting the team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-click-to-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bctt-ctt-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=A%20team%20with%20a%20bad%20developer%20is%20way%20better%20off%20short%20one%20developer%20than%20it%20is%20with%20a%20bad%20element.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;A team with a bad developer is way better off short one developer than it is with a bad element.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://wp.me/p9P37B-HE&amp;amp;text=A%20team%20with%20a%20bad%20developer%20is%20way%20better%20off%20short%20one%20developer%20than%20it%20is%20with%20a%20bad%20element.&amp;amp;via=AnaxiHQ&amp;amp;related=AnaxiHQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;bctt-ctt-btn&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A manager who doesn’t understand this is a manager who doesn’t understand software engineering. You have the case for a bad manager, but that’s for another article ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do? I would say this is a question to raise in your one-on-one with your manager, so they can address the issue. If your manager does nothing, you have several options: see if the developer can be coached, and take it upon yourself (and with the cooperation of other teammates), or change teams/companies. Hopefully, this article can help convince the said developer to be a better co-worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ae94&quot; id=&quot;ae94&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;People are resorting to blockchain for all kinds of reasons these days. Ever since I started doing smart contract security audits in mid-2017, I’ve seen it all. A special category of cases is ‘blockchain use’ that seems logical and beneficial, but actually contains a problem that then spreads from one startup to another. I am going to give some examples of such problems and ineffective solutions so that you (developer/customer/investor) know what to do when somebody offers you to use blockchain this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;e435&quot; id=&quot;e435&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Disclaimers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;1144&quot; id=&quot;1144&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The described use cases and problems occur at the initial stage. I am not saying these problems are impossible to solve. However, it is important to understand which solutions system creators offer for particular problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;b31a&quot; id=&quot;b31a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Even though the term ‘blockchain use’ looks strange and I am not sure that blockchain can be used for anything other than money (Bitcoin), I am going to use it without quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*CxdGcfL9MeGpf61V.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1240&quot; data-height=&quot;688&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*CxdGcfL9MeGpf61V.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*CxdGcfL9MeGpf61V.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
People are resorting to blockchain for all kinds of reasons these days.
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6f31&quot; id=&quot;6f31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;1. Supply chain management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c9a2&quot; id=&quot;c9a2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s say you ordered some goods, and a carrier guarantees to maintain certain transportation conditions, such as keeping your goods cold. A proposed solution is to install a sensor in a truck that will monitor fridge temperature and regularly transmit the data to the blockchain. This way, you can make sure that the promised conditions are met along the entire route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;224b&quot; id=&quot;224b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The problem here is not blockchain, but rather sensor, related. Being part of the physical world, the sensor is easy to fool. For example, a malicious carrier might only cool down a small fridge inside the truck in which they put the sensor, while leaving the goods in the non-refrigerated section of the truck to save costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*yEU4tNk3WVP1EkYr.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1129&quot; data-height=&quot;433&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*yEU4tNk3WVP1EkYr.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*yEU4tNk3WVP1EkYr.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;91fa&quot; id=&quot;91fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I would describe this problem as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8065&quot; id=&quot;8065&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not Internet of Things (IOT).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;987e&quot; id=&quot;987e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We will return to this statement a few more times. Even though blockchain does not allow for modification of data, it cannot ensure such data is correct. The only exception is on-chain transactions, when the system does not need the real world, with all necessary information already being within the blockchain, thus allowing the system to verify data (e.g. that an address has enough funds to proceed with a transaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b8f&quot; id=&quot;3b8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Applications that submit information to a blockchain from the outside are called “oracles” (see article ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.smartdec.net/oracles-or-why-smart-contracts-still-havent-changed-the-world-69464999e1d3&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.smartdec.net/oracles-or-why-smart-contracts-still-havent-changed-the-world-69464999e1d3&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oracles, or Why Smart Contracts Haven’t Changed the World Yet?&lt;/a&gt;’ by Alexander Drygin. Until a solution to the problem with oracles is found, any attempt at blockchain-based supply chain management, like the case above, is as pointless as trying to design a plane without first developing a reliable engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;186b&quot; id=&quot;186b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I borrowed the fridge case from the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/375.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘Do you Need Blockchain’ by Karl Wüst and Arthur Gervais&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend reading this article and paying particular attention to the following diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*knXnK63CHrLH8LFQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1120&quot; data-height=&quot;949&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*knXnK63CHrLH8LFQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*knXnK63CHrLH8LFQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6eff&quot; id=&quot;6eff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;2. Object authenticity guarantee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6b3a&quot; id=&quot;6b3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Even though this case is similar to the previous one, I would like to single it out as it is presented in a different wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d28&quot; id=&quot;4d28&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Say we make unique and expensive goods, such as watches, wines, or cars. We want our customers to be absolutely sure they are buying something made by us, so we link our wine bottle to a token supported by blockchain and put a QR code on it. Now, every step of the way (from manufacturer, to carrier, to store, to customer) is confirmed by a separate blockchain transaction and the customer can track their bottle online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5b08&quot; id=&quot;5b08&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, this system is vulnerable to a very simple threat: a dishonest seller can make a copy of a real bottle with a token, fill it with wine of lower quality, and either steal your expensive wine or sell it to someone who does not care about tokens. Why is it so easy? That’s right! Because…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f4c1&quot; id=&quot;f4c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not IoT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;032e&quot; id=&quot;032e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A bottle is a physical object, and as such can be faked, unlike a digital signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4f7a&quot; id=&quot;4f7a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;3. Statement authenticity guarantee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b66f&quot; id=&quot;b66f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s take university diploma authenticity as an example. In this case, we need to verify the genuineness of the statement (“Peter graduated from the university”), rather than a physical object. To make sure the diploma is authentic and the date of issue is accurate, we need to check a digital signature and a time stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cab7&quot; id=&quot;cab7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Digital signatures are great, some even call the asymmetric cryptography they are based on ‘the greatest invention of the 20th century’. But let’s not confuse it with blockchain. Indeed, digital signatures existed and served us well before blockchain was around. Be careful! Today, digital signatures are often sold as blockchain. Perhaps a digital signature is all you really need and blockchain does not really suit your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9ec4&quot; id=&quot;9ec4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Timestamping is closer to blockchain. In fact, blockchain itself is the most reliable timestamping method. You don’t need to invent anything: just put a hash of your data into Bitcoin blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;373f&quot; id=&quot;373f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Is it a good idea to put a hash of student diploma digitally signed by several professors on Bitcoin blockchain? Yes. However, it is important not to screw this system up by using centralized verification through a website or an app, which will be a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;0355&quot; id=&quot;0355&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;4. Voting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;051c&quot; id=&quot;051c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;When it comes to using blockchain for voting, we need to be clear about what problem we want to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d44f&quot; id=&quot;d44f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Forgery of vote/voter authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; To tackle this problem, we need digital signature rather than blockchain. The main issue here is a private key: where to get it from and how to store it. I won’t explain why any system in which a key is generated anywhere other than on the end user’s device is broken by design. However, on top of this, it is also important to have open source and properly audited key generating software, third-party hardware (smartphone being the simplest option), and a user who can handle a private key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b61f&quot; id=&quot;b61f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While a system developer can address the first two issues, the third is much more difficult. Bitcoin may actually help us learn how to deal with keys. Indeed, losing a password to your social media account or your vote is one thing, but losing a key to your own money is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1889&quot; id=&quot;1889&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet again, it is oracle that links a public key to a particular person if we need it for the voting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*7bVT9k7V2nztSTFf.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;625&quot; data-height=&quot;415&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7bVT9k7V2nztSTFf.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e581&quot; id=&quot;e581&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Publicly visible vote counting:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be safe to assume that, say, Ethereum smart contracts are perfect for this issue, as they allow everybody to see how many votes any particular candidate received. However, in this case the level of openness may be too much, as we can see how each and every person votes, and thus can influence them. Although the system may be built in such a way that every vote is only visible to the person who cast it, there is another more complicated challenge: as long as voters are technically able to bring evidence of their voting choice, they could still be put under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f96c&quot; id=&quot;f96c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;UPD:&lt;/strong&gt; Colleagues assure me that there is a solution: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;incoercible encryption.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5b16&quot; id=&quot;5b16&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And here, once again, we need oracles to check whether there have been any extra votes from nonexistent voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7f30&quot; id=&quot;7f30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;5. Proof of authorship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da25&quot; id=&quot;da25&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s say Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; wants to use blockchain to register that a certain painting is his. He takes a photo of it, puts the photo hash in blockchain, and then uploads the photo to a blog. Now, if Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; claims that the painting belongs to him, Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; can easily prove his authorship by showing the photo and hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84c5&quot; id=&quot;84c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are two potential issues in this case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;5bc3&quot; id=&quot;5bc3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; can say he did not know about blockchain and thus could not use it to register his authorship. Therefore, this procedure can only work if it becomes common practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6fb0&quot; id=&quot;6fb0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Second, Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; could break into Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;’s studio, take a photo of the painting, and place the hash in blockchain before Artist &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;d8ab&quot; id=&quot;d8ab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The reason is that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6275&quot; id=&quot;6275&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not IoT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ebcf&quot; id=&quot;ebcf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet, in general, this use case makes sense. However, it does not require anything other than Bitcoin’s blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;20cd&quot; id=&quot;20cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am talking about proof of authorship only, as the concept of intellectual property is nonsense in my opinion: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mises.org/library/against-intellectual-property-0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://mises.org/library/against-intellectual-property-0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘Against Intellectual Property’ by Stephan Kinsella&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3927&quot; id=&quot;3927&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;6. Land registry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;77dd&quot; id=&quot;77dd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Another proposed case is linking blockchain-based tokens to land ownership. There are at least two issues with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e3a3&quot; id=&quot;e3a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Enforcer actions:&lt;/strong&gt; While a bottle/watch/car can be handed over peer-to-peer (P2P), land ownership and transfer must be registered by a regulatory authority, which can always physically visit your land and enforce its will. What will happen to a blockchain record if the regulatory authority insists that you should transfer your land? The first option: blockchain record still specifies you as a land owner, which is not true anymore; the second option: the regulatory authority can make its own record and thus rewrite yours, which means that blockchain doesn’t work. This is a critical point since blockchain is also promoted as a tool protecting you against the fraudulent activities of both the regulatory authorities and any individual officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;71ef&quot; id=&quot;71ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Centralized development and support:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, who is going to develop such a system and support nodes? If the regulatory authority itself or its counterparty is to do the job, then such a system won’t be decentralized. A decentralized protocol plus centralized development equals a centralized protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1006&quot; id=&quot;1006&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Besides, each time somebody offers you blockchain, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1a1&quot; id=&quot;f1a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Can we use a distributed database instead?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e48&quot; id=&quot;0e48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If the answer is ‘Yes’, why go for blockchain at all? Indeed, blockchain is slower and more resource-intensive. Plus, specialists in database development and integration are much less expensive and easier to find, their work product is easier to check, and system support is simpler too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4cab&quot; id=&quot;4cab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Given all these challenges, I believe a distributed database to be a much better choice for land registry today, even though it definitely needs to become more reliable and open (see ‘Blockchain as a Trigger’ section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5145&quot; id=&quot;5145&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Indeed, it looks like this particular use case has already become a reality. Bitfury recently announced the launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://exonum.com/ru/napr&quot; data-href=&quot;https://exonum.com/ru/napr&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a blockchain land registry system built on the Exonum framework&lt;/a&gt; and is set to do the same in Ukraine and Moldova. Strangely enough, I could not find any technical details of this case, meaning that for some reason Bitfury is in no rush to boast of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3806&quot; id=&quot;3806&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;7. Interbank transfers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b18&quot; id=&quot;8b18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;This case is a good one according to the scheme from ‘Do you need blockchain?’ It involves a number of parties that do not trust each other, without any trusted third party being engaged. Although Bitcoin can be used here, banks are unlikely to make their mutual payments publicly visible. Therefore, we would offer a private blockchain where only banks themselves can input data, support nodes, and verify the transactions of all other parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed1a&quot; id=&quot;ed1a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In terms of functionality, does this system differ from a distributed database with access control? Yes, it does, but only when it comes to a disagreement between the parties. Here, the question is: will banks agree to a consensus offered by the system or will they appeal to a court? If banks can choose the second option (i.e. they have never signed an agreement to unconditionally accept all decisions offered by the system) then this system makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a10d&quot; id=&quot;a10d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Plus, this entire case will be nonsensical if regulatory bodies prohibit or restrict the use of such systems or instruct the courts to refuse system data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d095&quot; id=&quot;d095&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;8. Token for token’s sake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;69d7&quot; id=&quot;69d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Yes, that’s right! I’m actually writing about ICO in the year 2019. To prove its continued relevance, let me just point out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/bittorrent-token-is-already-nearly-6-times-its-ico-price&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/bittorrent-token-is-already-nearly-6-times-its-ico-price&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on January 28, BitTorrent had a successful ICO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8689&quot; id=&quot;8689&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What I mean by ‘Token for token’s sake’ is that some startups issue tokens and say they entitle you to a share in their companies/ profits/ split-fee options. The problem is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1104&quot; id=&quot;1104&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Blockchain is not IoT!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0c26&quot; id=&quot;0c26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Unlike venture capital investors or regulatory bodies, blockchain won’t hold a startup accountable or responsible to their investors. A promise in the form of a token alone does not oblige a company’s founders to do anything — something we saw many times during the ICO boom (remember Lambos?). In this respect, an ICO is more similar to crowd funding than an IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0686&quot; id=&quot;0686&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although pro decentralized institutions and against regulatory control, I must admit there are almost no such systems in this field yet, which means you must either go for existing tools or trust company founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2a18&quot; id=&quot;2a18&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now, let me describe some promising use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2356&quot; id=&quot;2356&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Blockchain as a trigger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f3b6&quot; id=&quot;f3b6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Oddly enough, even non-working cases may be useful. Say a corporation uses a long-outdated process/system. Instead of opting for a normal and obvious solution, management decides to invest in hype (blockchain/big data/AI/IoT) to gain a lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*dmnTh_4IwdOT8CPE.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1200&quot; data-height=&quot;850&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*dmnTh_4IwdOT8CPE.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*dmnTh_4IwdOT8CPE.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9698&quot; id=&quot;9698&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That’s when a savvy yet responsible &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapreneurship&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;intrapreneur&lt;/a&gt; can offer a proper system design, marketing it as blockchain. Depending on the situation, blockchain can either give certain advantages or be not the case at all living on slick presentation slides only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f53&quot; id=&quot;8f53&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hint: If you are offered the chance to use blockchain, make sure it is actually blockchain. However, even if it is not, it could still be a sensible offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2566&quot; id=&quot;2566&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;283c&quot; id=&quot;283c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Blockchain is perfect for handling money, primarily because it was created exactly for this purpose. Blockchain records and verifies statements like ‘Party A owned X amount; Party A transferred X amount to Party B; Party B owns X amount’ as all previous similar statements were recorded within the same blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14f0&quot; id=&quot;14f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the second part of the series of his posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/decentralized-disruption-who-dares-wins-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-4-of-4-f022e8641c1a&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/decentralized-disruption-who-dares-wins-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-4-of-4-f022e8641c1a&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BitTorrent Lessons for Crypto&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/if-youre-not-breaking-rules-you-re-doing-it-wrong-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-2-of-4-72c68227fe69&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@simonhmorris/if-youre-not-breaking-rules-you-re-doing-it-wrong-bittorrent-lessons-for-crypto-2-of-4-72c68227fe69&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘If You’re Not Breaking Rules You’re Doing It Wrong’,&lt;/a&gt; Simon Morris says that the original objective of decentralization is to break the rules, as those who observe those rules will try to stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8983&quot; id=&quot;8983&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Bitcoin meets this requirement perfectly, as it breaks the old rule according to which only the government issues money, defines issuing procedures, and decides which transaction is valid and which is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;27e7&quot; id=&quot;27e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;More importantly, I think Bitcoin performs a specific role: the transfer of value that existed long before the technology in an easy to understand manner (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;‘Shelling Out: The Origins of Money’ by Nick Szabo&lt;/a&gt;). At the same time, the majority of blockchain startups have to explain from the very beginning which task they solve and why — something which is nonsensical even for traditional startups that usually look for customers, test hypotheses, and try to stay in sync with the market, i.e. solve existing problems, rather than invent new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8052&quot; id=&quot;8052&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At any rate, Bitcoin is the only working blockchain application so far. That is why, at the beginning of my article, I questioned the relevance of the term ‘blockchain use’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9cc1&quot; id=&quot;9cc1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I do not include cases in which blockchain is not used by end users, but rather by another blockchain that is, in turn, used by decentralized exchanges where tokens of the third blockchain are listed. Who knows, the industry may actually manage to pull itself out of the swamp this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f1dc&quot; id=&quot;f1dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Smart contracts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9687&quot; id=&quot;9687&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Let’s be honest: nobody really knows what smart contracts are and what they are for, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1051603179526270976&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1051603179526270976&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this concept&lt;/a&gt; is still in its infancy. Ethereum is truly ahead of the curve. By the time decentralized Bitcoin came into play, people already knew and were used to e-money; by the time we got decentralized smart contracts running on Ethereum, we were still struggling to handle hard-copy contracts, while centralized smart contracts are simply non-existent yet. We can try and jump two steps at once, but to do so we need time and a viable concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2959&quot; id=&quot;2959&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Personally, I believe that smart contracts will find their niche. That’s why I am working in the field already. However, this is my personal belief, which has not been neither confirmed nor refuted yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1eab&quot; id=&quot;1eab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed5f&quot; id=&quot;ed5f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I presented the ideas described above in &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/317594640&quot; data-href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/317594640&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my speech at ETHDenver&lt;/a&gt; conference. By the way, ETHDenver was great!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mark Zuckerberg Promised a Clear History Tool Almost a Year Ago</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-privacy-optics-clear-history-zuckerberg</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook spent most of 2018&lt;/strong&gt; embroiled in one scandal or another. But there was a point early on in the year when Mark Zuckerberg thought he could turn down the heat by offering a fix for the public’s privacy concerns. It was just weeks after the news broke that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had surreptitiously obtained and employed the personal data of millions of people. And as the company headed into its annual F8 developers conference in May, the chief executive proposed a dramatic change ahead of a rehearsal for the keynote address: What if they announced a tool that let users clear web-browsing information that Facebook uses to target users with ads?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestion caught people involved in the event’s production, where planning begins at least six months in advance, off guard. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-says-youll-soon-be-able-to-flush-your-browsing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clear History&lt;/a&gt;” didn’t exist; it was barely an idea. But organizers still scrambled to build its announcement into Zuckerberg's F8 keynote address. They'd already scrapped plans to unveil Portal, a video calling device that Facebook's leadership thought might be seen as too invasive given the company’s predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bold public relations play. And for those familiar with the origins of the Clear History announcement, it demonstrated not only Zuckerberg’s unilateral power over product direction, but also Facebook’s long history of prioritizing optics and convenience over substantive protections for the people who use it. Company sources who spoke to BuzzFeed News characterized Zuckerberg’s proposal as “reactionary,” a response intended to ease the negative attention on the company following the Cambridge Analytica firestorm. They also said it might explain why the Clear History tool, whose announcement was proposed on the fly by Zuckerberg, is still not available nearly a year after he introduced it on stage at F8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We really had nothing to show anyone. Mark just wanted to score some points.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;84.436955698599&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you watch the presentation, we really had nothing to show anyone,” said one person, who was close to F8. “Mark just wanted to score some points.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg do not make judgment calls “until pressure is applied,” said another former employee, who worked with Facebook's leadership and declined to be named for fear of retribution. “That pressure could come from the press or regulators, but they’re not keen on decision-making until they’re forced to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether it is with genocide or false news, there are never going to be changes until the pressure becomes too great,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has long portrayed itself as an advocate for user rights. But former employees and critics say the company's true ethos has often been in opposition to this. Facebook's communications around privacy have historically been opportunistic and protectionist, deployed to cover up for the last transgression from its &quot;move fast and break things&quot; ideology — from the 2007 Beacon program, which allowed companies to track purchases by Facebook users without their consent, to the 2010 loophole that allowed advertisers to access people’s personal Facebook information without permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes we move too fast — and after listening to recent concerns, we're responding,” Zuckerberg wrote in a 2010 op-ed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/23/AR2010052303828.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. That was just before the company agreed to a Federal Trade Commission consent decree, which charged that Facebook had routinely changed users’ privacy settings in order to obtain their information. The company is currently negotiating with the FTC, which has been investigating whether or not Facebook violated the terms of that consent decree and should be punished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last spring, as Facebook dealt with fallout from Cambridge Analytica, compliance with Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and renewed attention on how it tracks all internet users following Zuckerberg’s ten hours of congressional testimony in April, the company’s ask-forgiveness-not-permission playbook was in plain view. It took out full-page newspaper apologies, placed its chief executive on podcasts and televised interviews, and sent Sandberg to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-21/facebook-s-sandberg-meets-attorneys-general-behind-closed-doors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;meet with state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; and lawmakers behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My worry is that Facebook is doing anything it can to garner goodwill and diffuse concern,” said Ashkan Soltani, the FTC’s chief technologist from October 2014 to November 2015. “I’m not sure of the sincerity of those actions since, historically, the company uses privacy selectively and strategically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whether it is with genocide or false news, there are never going to be changes until the pressure becomes too great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five former employees who spoke with BuzzFeed News say they are skeptical of that goodwill effort, with three noting that the external messaging and marketing around privacy has only become a focus for executives during the last 12 months. One pointed out that an international ad campaign last spring, focused on how “fake news” and “clickbait” “is not your friend,” was quickly repurposed to address “data misuse” days after the first Cambridge Analytica stories broke. Two highlighted Zuckerberg’s desire to rush out a Clear History announcement ahead of F8. Some ridiculed the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/facebooks-privacy-pop-up-shop-bryant-park-nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy pop-up store&lt;/a&gt; in New York City’s Bryant Park in December, which was built to show that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/social/facebooks-carolyn-everson-privacy-foundation-company/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;privacy is the foundation of our company&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s public relations,” said one former employee. “It’s, ‘Hey, look at this shiny thing, please don’t pay attention to this mushroom cloud.’” This also appears to be the case with Clear History, which, while touted by both Sandberg and Zuckerberg in recent months as an example of Facebook’s commitment to getting privacy right, has yet to actually launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook disagreed with the characterization that privacy promises are used to distract from the real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know we have work to do to regain people's trust, and it's why we've strengthened our teams, created a new privacy and data use organization, built new tools, and set clearer policies designed to better protect people's information,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “We still face legitimate scrutiny, but we’re not the same company we were even a year ago, and we’re determined to do more to keep people safe across our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former employees, however, are not willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have a long-running strategy of using communications to disagree and push this counter-narrative against any criticism,” one said. “They’re playing the same game they’ve always played, but the challenge for them is that the world has changed and privacy concerns are increasing dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With his company&lt;/strong&gt; staring down what could reportedly be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/14/us-government-facebook-are-negotiating-record-multi-billion-dollar-fine-companys-privacy-lapses/?utm_term=.f86046b8573d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a multibillion-dollar fine&lt;/a&gt; from the FTC for violating its 2011 consent decree, Zuckerberg is acutely aware of what public perception around privacy could do to Facebook’s business. In its 2018 annual report, the company outlined not only the risks associated with changing privacy laws including GDPR and the recently passed California Consumer Privacy Act, which the company lobbied against, but also the danger of becoming the media’s punching bag if news outlets dug into Facebook’s practices around data use and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms of service, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products ... has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation,” the company stated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680119000009/fb-12312018x10k.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a January financial filing&lt;/a&gt;. The statement goes on to outline the “intense media coverage” surrounding Cambridge Analytica and the possibility of negative publicity to adversely affect the company’s size, engagement, user loyalty, and, in turn, revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Facebook continues to grow — its sales, profit, and monthly active users (MAU) all increased in 2018 — there are plenty of signs that it may not be able to continue on the path. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-FACEBOOK-POLL/0100619Q2Q6/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Multiple surveys&lt;/a&gt; have shown that users are losing trust in the social network, including one where the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adweek.com/digital/consumers-dont-trust-facebook-with-personal-data-survey-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ranked last&lt;/a&gt; among brands including Amazon, Google, Visa, and Comcast that handle personal data. And that mistrust could translate to unrest among investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The list of problems the company is grappling with is vast, including complicity in a genocide, enabling social and political instability in different countries around the world, the unwitting sharing of consumer data and antagonized legislators in the US, the UK, Europe and beyond,” Pivotal Research’s Brian Wieser, one of the more bearish Facebook analysts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-07/facebook-s-biggest-bear-says-problems-likely-to-worsen-in-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote in a January report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One former employee noted that Facebook’s executives historically only took privacy seriously if problems affected the key metrics of daily active users, which totaled 1.52 billion accounts in December, or monthly active users, which totaled 2.32 billion accounts. Both figures increased by about 9% year-over-year in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pr4&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If it came down to user privacy or MAU growth, Facebook always chose the latter.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;71&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If it came down to user privacy or MAU growth, Facebook always chose the latter,” the person said. That source pointed to internal Facebook emails obtained and released by a UK parliamentary inquiry that showed, among other things, the company’s then–deputy chief privacy officer Yul Kwon discussing how to allow Facebook’s Android app to read a phone’s call logs without triggering a permission pop-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Facebook’s leaders were worried about the public relations scenario that could have occurred if Android’s permissions did appear, as they were intended, to ask users to consent to the app reading their call logs. Instead of asking for less access, however, they sought a workaround so that they could still suck up the data without making people aware that they were doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a pretty high risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,” one Facebook employee, Michael LeBeau, wrote in early 2015. “We think the risk of PR fallout here is high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout, however, came more than three years after those emails, after UK parliamentarians obtained them and used them to bolster their case that Facebook operated as a “digital gangster” with little regard for law or scrutiny in a report earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is evident that Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws,” the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) Committee wrote in what is perhaps the strongest rebuke of the company by a governing body to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook altered a global ad campaign to include the phrase “Data misuse is not your friend” last spring following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two people who used to work at Facebook said that it’s hard to take the company’s apologies and commitments to privacy seriously after witnessing its attempt to get ahead of outlets preparing to publish stories about Cambridge Analytica. Last March, the New York Times, the Guardian, and the Observer were readying stories about a former employee at the political consulting firm who had evidence that Cambridge Analytica had illicitly obtained data on millions of Facebook users and deployed that information for American political campaigns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlets, according to multiple people familiar with the situation, had been in communication with Facebook about their stories for at least a week, and the company’s public relations team was well-aware that the pieces would be published on the weekend. In response, Facebook’s communications team decided to get ahead of the stories, &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publishing a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the company’s deputy general counsel the preceding Friday about suspending accounts associated with Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were essentially scooping the news,” one source said, explaining that Facebook was trying to soften the blow of any future story on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the attempt, the blog post, which was picked up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/16/facebook-bans-trump-campaigns-data-analytics-firm-for-taking-user-data/?utm_term=.e16d99cc785a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major news outlets&lt;/a&gt;, acted as an accelerant for the stories that would publish the next day. That, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/23/facebook-says-warning-to-guardian-group-not-our-wisest-move&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a legal threat&lt;/a&gt; sent to Guardian Media Group in the UK, compounded the attention and turned Cambridge Analytica into a full-blown maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were essentially scooping the news.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;122.21597874949&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three former employees who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that there are people at Facebook who do want to put the the social network’s users first. One acknowledged Facebook’s constant privacy scandals but attributed those mistakes to a “highly decentralized company” where issues arise “less because of an act of malice, and more as unintended consequences.” Another said there are “privacy purists who care about this deeply” but that “there is an equal number of people that looks at privacy as a lever to pull to improve user sentiment and, in turn, revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg’s thinking fluctuates between both camps, that person said, favoring privacy when he realizes his company’s actions have triggered a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technology news site TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; found that Zuckerberg and other executives had been given “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/facebook-has-a-two-tiered-privacy-system-that-favors-its&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;special treatment&lt;/a&gt;” by employing a tool that deleted old messages from both a sender’s and receiver’s mailboxes. Unlike Messenger for normal users, which retains messages indefinitely and gives users no option to delete old messages, Zuckerberg had been selectively eliminating threads from 2014 and earlier, sparking outrage among some employees who didn’t understand why their chief executive had a privacy feature that wasn’t available to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sources recalled the backlash at an all-hands meeting, where several employees confronted the chief executive for secretly claiming special platform privileges that belied the company’s supposed internal dedication to transparency. In response, Zuckerberg told employees at the all-hands that the message deletion practice had come into effect because of the 2014 Sony Pictures hack to protect executives’ communications. A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the substance of internal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One source called the answer a “dodge” scripted by the company’s internal communications team, and noted Zuckerberg’s hypocrisy was in plain view: He protected his own privacy, while publicly diminishing privacy concerns that emerged in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever reactive, Facebook quickly announced plans to launch an “unsend message” tool, which would allow users to retract messages within 10 minutes of sending them. That feature, which is not at all the same thing as Zuckerberg’s ability to delete years-old messages, is now reportedly being &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/how-facebook-messenger-remove-works/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tested in certain markets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one former employee, this incident highlights a systemic issue at a company that is worth more than $450 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think these problems have been traditionally viewed as communications, policy, and legal problems, not necessarily as core product challenges, and that’s likely why they’re in this problem,” the source said. “Ultimately when comms and policy and legal have been called on to solve an issue, it means that we’re already in a crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sources told BuzzFeed News that Facebook executives continue to view the problems of 2018 fundamentally as communication issues. They said some insiders among leadership and the rank and file could not understand how Facebook had become the focus of so much public ire and floated the idea that news publications, who had seen their business models decimated by Facebook and Google, had been directed to cover the company in a harsher light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, the company invited a number of publications — including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and BuzzFeed News — for what one person called an off-the-record “media reset.” Executives including Sandberg, chief product officer Chris Cox, and augmented and virtual reality vice president Andrew “Boz” Bosworth met reporters and editors in an attempt to rebuild relationships with outlets that had been covering Facebook critically. (The author of this story learned of these talks independent of BuzzFeed News’ meeting with Facebook’s executives.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the former Facebook insiders who spoke with BuzzFeed News struggled to understand why there have been few management changes after that past year. “Certain leaders have been making bad calls,” one said, leaving the company in “crisis after crisis.” Yet aside from an executive shuffle where leaders were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17330226/facebook-reorg-mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp-messenger-ceo-blockchain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reorganized into different positions&lt;/a&gt; in May, few people, besides policy and communications head Elliot Schrage, have been shown the door. (And even Schrage still technically remains at the company in a special projects advisory role.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s an abdication of responsibility by the two at the top that runs deep — all the way down to junior leadership looking the other way,” another former employee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK’s DCMS committee agreed. “The management structure of Facebook is opaque to those outside the business and this seemed to be designed to conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;108.09513546798&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late last year&lt;/strong&gt;, Facebook decided to allay privacy concerns by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-hires-privacy-critics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hiring some of its biggest critics&lt;/a&gt;. In December, the company scooped up Nate Cardozo, formerly of the Electronic Frontier Foundation; Robyn Greene, from New America’s Open Technology Institute; and Nathan White, of Access Now, a digital rights foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After the privacy beating Facebook’s taken over the last year, I was skeptical too,” Cardozo, who once called the company’s business model “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/10/06/nate-cardozo-facebook-others-confuse-consumers-for-profit/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;creepy&lt;/a&gt;,” wrote in a Facebook post announcing his new position. “But the privacy team I’ll be joining knows me well, and knows exactly how I feel about tech policy, privacy, and encrypted messaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hiring new people doesn't absolve Facebook for past bad practices, or guarantee future improvements,” Estelle Massé, a senior policy analyst for Access Now, wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. “Given the legacy of Facebook’s policies and practices, it will be difficult to right this ship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, Facebook’s public discussions of Clear History appear to have been more about communications strategy than charting a new course. In a Facebook post looking back on 2018, Zuckerberg pointed to the tool as one that would “give people more transparency” while Sandberg highlighted it to show Facebook’s willingness to change during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, nine months after its initial announcement, Clear History is nowhere to be found. A Facebook executive conceded in a December &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/12/17/18140062/facebook-clear-history-update-privacy-targeting-data-collection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview with Recode&lt;/a&gt; that “it’s taking longer than we initially thought” due to issues with how data is stored and processed. The company will now reportedly start testing the tool in the spring led by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17331268/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-privacy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new privacy product unit&lt;/a&gt; Zuckerberg created last May amid various scandals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want to make sure this works the way it should for everyone on Facebook, which is taking longer than expected,” the company said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if new high-profile hires, like Cardozo and Greene, will work with Facebook’s new privacy unit or if they will be involved with Clear History. (Zuckerberg did say last May that the company would be working with “privacy advocates” on its new tool to “make sure we get it right.”) It has reached out to groups like Access Now, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), as well as academics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources confirmed that CDT and EFF were advising Facebook on its Clear History tool, but could not disclose specifics of their meetings due to nondisclosure agreements. Access Now’s Massé confirmed Facebook had reached out on a number of issues, including Clear History, in the last few months, but called the conversations “punctual and limited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite repeated statements and apologies from the company, we are not seeing a shift in Facebook data practices or an attitude that would suggest that they take data protection seriously,” she said. “What we are seeing so far are reactionary measures in an attempt to sway public opinion, rather than a fundamental shift in the way the company considers users’ rights to privacy and data protection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-pullquote xs-relative col xs-col-12 xs-z1 xs-mb4 md-mb2 md-col-5 md-pl4 md-float-right&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-quote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There could be a gap between what Facebook says it’s deleting and what they’re actually deleting.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;92.865366759517&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy experts also pushed back on the idea that Clear History could be a cure-all for Facebook’s privacy ails. For one, it’s still unclear what the tool will allow users to delete and, as the CDT’s Natasha Duarte notes, features like these don’t necessarily guarantee better privacy. “The tool may be able to delete information that Facebook holds about a user’s interaction with other websites, but inferences from those interactions may already be incorporated into Facebook’s algorithm,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine if a user visited a site for Dyson vacuums and Facebook registered that interaction through a tracker. Clear History might let a user remove information about that Dyson site visit from Facebook’s servers, but if that information has already been collected and algorithmically processed into a preference for ads about other household cleaning products, clearing history doesn't mean much. As Duarte explained: “There could be a gap between what Facebook says it’s deleting and what it is actually deleting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former insiders were also concerned about how much Facebook would emphasize or promote Clear History after launch, noting that past privacy features have sometimes been introduced with minimum functionality and high amounts of friction to possibly discourage users. One former employee cited a feature that allows users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992?helpref=hc_global_nav&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;download all their Facebook information&lt;/a&gt;, but noted that it was hard to find and created file formats that were hard to read and share. Another recalled how the company unveiled a tool for “Nearby Friends,” but required “an inordinate number of clicks” to turn off the feature, which then defaulted to only pausing a user’s involvement for a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seemed like a douchey move, and it was unclear if it was a deliberate choice or poor design,” the employee said. (A Facebook spokesperson disagreed with these characterizations and said the company builds controls “so that people will be able to easily find and use them.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the last 12 months, Facebook has lost that benefit of the doubt, according to privacy experts, and Clear History may be too little, too late. Groups including Access Now and CDT are calling for policymakers to step in, and even the social network’s executives seem resigned to some type of eventual privacy law in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facebook has made good on just about every opportunity to lower expectations that it would protect user privacy without a government forcing it to,” Massé told BuzzFeed News. “It is high time for the US to adopt comprehensive data protection legislation to bring sectorwide safeguards for our personal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s track record speaks for itself, said Gennie Gebhart, a consumer privacy researcher at EFF. Gebhart, who’s been in discussions with Facebook about Clear History, noted that she maintains a certain skepticism that the company is capable of deeper change, and compared its past privacy promises to rearranging deck chairs on the &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re focused on solving the problem of needing to be seen like they're doing something, rather than solving the actual problem,” she said. “And that needs to change.”●&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:title>Mark Zuckerberg Promised A Clear History Tool Almost A Year Ago. Where Is It?</og:title>
<og:description>Last May, Facebook promised to create a “Clear History” function it said would give users more control over their data. Nine months later it's nowhere to be found and sources say it's a key example of the company's “reactionary” way of dealing with privacy concerns.</og:description>

<title>Outrage culture is out of control</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;It can be enlivening, certainly, to get caught up in a fight. However, one should come armed with courage, rather than, say, surreptitiously taking photos of me in public and posting them on social media, or anonymously calling all my husband’s vendors and telling them to stop working with a company that supports “rape culture.” Yes, that’s a quote. This campaign, led by so-called feminists, sees no irony in trying to drive a man out of business because his wife voices opinions of her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA of life on Earth naturally stores its information in just four key chemicals — guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine, commonly referred to as G, C, A and T, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now scientists have doubled this number of life’s building blocks, creating for the first time a synthetic, eight-letter genetic language that seems to store and transcribe information just like natural DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published on 22 February in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00650-8#ref-CR1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a consortium of researchers led by Steven Benner, founder of the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Alachua, Florida, suggests that an expanded genetic alphabet could, in theory, also support life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a real landmark,” says Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. The study implies that there is nothing particularly “magic” or special about those four chemicals that evolved on Earth, says Romesberg. “That’s a conceptual breakthrough,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, as a pair of DNA strands twist around each other in a double helix, the chemicals on each strand pair up: A bonds to T, and C bonds with G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, scientists have tried to add more pairs of these chemicals, also known as bases, to this genetic code. For example, Benner first created ‘unnatural’ bases in the 1980s. Other groups have followed, with Romesberg’s lab making headlines in 2014 after inserting a pair of unnatural bases into a living cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the latest study is the first to systematically demonstrate that the complementary unnatural bases recognise and bind to each other, and that the double helix that they form holds its structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benner’s team, which includes researchers from various US companies and institutions, created the synthetic letters by tweaking the molecular structure of the regular bases. The letters of DNA pair up because they form hydrogen bonds: each contains hydrogen atoms, which are attracted to nitrogen or oxygen atoms in their partner. Benner explains that it’s a bit like Lego bricks that snap together when the holes and prongs line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting these holes and prongs, the team has come up with several new pairs of bases, including a pair named S and B, and another called P and Z&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00650-8#ref-CR2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In the latest paper, they describe how they combine these four synthetic bases with the natural ones. The researchers call the resulting eight-letter language ‘hachimoji’ after the Japanese words for ‘eight’ and ‘letter’. The additional bases are each similar in shape to one of the natural four, but have variations in their bonding patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then conducted a series of experiments that showed that their synthetic sequences shares properties with natural DNA that are essential for supporting life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data retrieval&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work as an information storage system, DNA has to follow predictable rules, so the team first demonstrated that, in a similar way to regular bases, the synthetic bases reliably formed pairs. They created hundreds of molecules of the synthetic DNA and found that the letters bound to their partners predictably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then showed that the structure of the double helices remained stable no matter what order the synthetic bases were in. This is important because for life to evolve, DNA sequences need to be able to vary without the whole structure falling apart. Using X-ray diffraction, the team showed that three different sequences of the synthetic DNA retained the same structure when crystallised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a substantial advance, says Philipp Holliger, a synthetic biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, because other methods of expanding the genetic alphabet are not as structurally sound. Instead of chemicals that use hydrogen bonds to pair up, these other approaches use water-repelling molecules as their bases. These can be placed at intervals in-between the natural letters, but the structure of DNA breaks down if they are placed in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team showed that the synthetic DNA could be faithfully transcribed into RNA. “The ability to store information is not very interesting for evolution,” says Benner. “You have to be able to transfer that information into a molecule that does something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting DNA into RNA is a key step for translating genetic information into proteins, the workhorses of life. But some RNA sequences, known as aptamers, can themselves bind to specific molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benner’s team created synthetic DNA that codes for a certain aptamer and then confirmed that the transcription had occurred and the RNA sequence functioned correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holliger says that the work is an exciting starting point, but there is still a substantial distance to go before reaching a true eight-letter synthetic genetic system. One key question, for example, will be whether the synthetic DNA can be replicated by polymerases, the enzymes responsible for synthesizing DNA inside organisms during cell division. This has been demonstrated for other methods such as Romesberg’s, which uses water-repelling bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variety of life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Benner says that the work shows that life could potentially be supported by DNA bases with different structures from the four that we know, which could be relevant in the search for signatures of life elsewhere in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding letters to DNA could also have more down-to-earth applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more diversity in the genetic building blocks, scientists could potentially create RNA or DNA sequences that can do things better than the standard four letters, including functions beyond genetic storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Benner’s group previously showed that strands of DNA that included Z and P were better at binding to cancer cells than sequences with just the standard four bases&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00650-8#ref-CR3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And Benner has set up a company which commercialises synthetic DNA for use in medical diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers could potentially use their synthetic DNA to create novel proteins as well as RNA. Benner’s team has also developed further pairs of new bases, opening up the possibility of creating DNA structures that contain 10 or even 12 letters. But the fact that the researchers have already expanded the genetic alphabet to eight is in itself remarkable, says Romesberg. “It’s already doubling what nature has.”&lt;/p&gt;

I paid attention that even&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; less devoted unixoids are high on native development.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; For me, as one that drinks and breaths cross-development all his professional&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; life, it sounds strange, but this mindset is not rare at all.&lt;p&gt;I can pretty much guarantee that as long as everybody does cross-development, the platform won't be all that stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people think that &quot;the cloud&quot; means that the instruction set doesn't matter. Develop at home, deploy in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's bullshit. If you develop on x86, then you're going to want to deploy on x86, because you'll be able to run what you test &quot;at home&quot; (and by &quot;at home&quot; I don't mean literally in your home, but in your work environment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means that you'll happily pay a bit more for x86 cloud hosting, simply because it matches what you can test on your own local setup, and the errors you get will translate better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is true even if what you mostly do is something ostensibly cross-platform like just run perl scripts or whatever. Simply because you'll want to have as similar an environment as possible,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which in turn means that cloud providers will end up making more money from their x86 side, which means that they'll prioritize it, and any ARM offerings will be secondary and probably relegated to the mindless dregs (maybe front-end, maybe just static html, that kind of stuff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guys, do you &lt;strong&gt;really not understand why x86 took over the server market&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just all price. It was &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; this &quot;develop at home&quot; issue. Thousands of small companies ended up having random small internal workloads where it was easy to just get a random whitebox PC and run some silly small thing on it yourself. Then as the workload expanded, it became a &quot;real server&quot;. And then once that thing expanded, suddenly it made a whole lot of sense to let somebody else manage the hardware and hosting, and the cloud took over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you really not understand? This isn't rocket science. This isn't some made up story. This is literally what happened, and what killed all the RISC vendors, and made x86 be the undisputed king of the hill of servers, to the point where everybody else is just a rounding error. Something that sounded entirely fictional a couple of decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a development platform, ARM in the server space is never going to make it. Trying to sell a 64-bit &quot;hyperscaling&quot; model is idiotic, when you don't have customers and you don't have workloads because you never sold the small cheap box that got the whole market started in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price advantage of ARM will never be there for ARM servers unless you get enough volume to make up for the absolutely &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; advantage in server volume that Intel has right now. Being a smaller die with cheaper NRE doesn't matter one whit, when you can't make up for the development costs in volume. Look at &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; ARM server offering so far: they were not only slower, they were more expensive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the power advantage is still largely theoretical and doesn't show very much on a system level anyway, and is also entirely irrelevant if people end up willing to pay more for an x86 box simply because it's what they developed their load on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which leaves absolutely no real advantage to ARM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is basic economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the only way that changes is if you end up saying &quot;look, you can deploy more cheaply on an ARM box, &lt;em&gt;and here's the development box you can do your work on&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actual hardware for developers is &lt;em&gt;hugely&lt;/em&gt; important. I seriously claim that this is why the PC took over, and why everything else died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you can pooh-pooh it all you want, and say &quot;just cross-build&quot;, but as long as you do that, you're going to be a tiny minority, and you don't see the big picture, and you're ignoring actual real history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And btw, calling this an &quot;unixoid&quot; mindset is just showing what a total disconnect to reality you have, and how stupid your argument is. Unix lost. Yes, it lives on in the shape of Linux, but Unix lost not just to Linux, but to Windows. In fact, arguably it lost to windows &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Same &lt;strong&gt;exact&lt;/strong&gt; reason, just on the software side. In both cases. Where did you find developers? You found them on Windows and on Linux, because that's what developers had access to. When those workloads grew up to be &quot;real&quot; workloads, they continued to be run on Windows and Linux, they weren't moved over to Unix platforms even if that would have been fairly easy in the Linux case. No, that was just unnecessary and pointless work. Just continue to deploy on the same platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exact&lt;/strong&gt; same issue on the software side as with the hardware. Cross-development is pointless and stupid when the alternative is to just develop and deploy on the same platform. Yes, you can do it, but you generally would like to avoid it if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;End result: cross-development is mainly done for platforms that are so weak as to make it pointless to develop on them. Nobody does native development in the embedded space. But whenever the target is powerful enough to support native development, there's a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; pressure to do it that way, because the cross-development model is so relatively painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corollary to the above is that yes, cross-development is also done when the target environment is too &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; to do native development on. That was the case for the big iron and traditional big Unix boxes. But that seriously erodes support for the expensive platform, and makes the cheap development platform much more able and likely to grow up into that space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's why x86 won. Do you really think the world has changed radically?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Linus is the ultimate unixoid. I paid attention that even 
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; less devoted unixoids are high on native development.
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; For me, as one that drinks and breaths cross-development all his professional 
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; life, it sounds strange, but this mindset is not rare at all.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I can pretty much guarantee that as long as everybody does 
&amp;gt; cross-development, the platform won't be all that stable.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Or successful.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Some people think that &quot;the cloud&quot; means that the instruction 
&amp;gt; set doesn't matter. Develop at home, deploy in the cloud.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; That's bullshit. If you develop on x86, then you're going to want to deploy 
&amp;gt; on x86, because you'll be able to run what you test &quot;at home&quot; (and by &quot;at home&quot; 
&amp;gt; I don't mean literally in your home, but in your work environment). 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Which means that you'll happily pay a bit more for x86 cloud hosting, simply because it matches 
&amp;gt; what you can test on your own local setup, and the errors you get will translate better.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; This is true even if what you mostly do is something ostensibly cross-platform like just run perl 
&amp;gt; scripts or whatever. Simply because you'll want to have as similar an environment as possible,
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Which in turn means that cloud providers will end up making more money from their x86 side, which 
&amp;gt; means that they'll prioritize it, and any ARM offerings will be secondary and probably relegated 
&amp;gt; to the mindless dregs (maybe front-end, maybe just static html, that kind of stuff).
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Guys, do you really not understand why x86 took over the server market?
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; It wasn't just all price. It was literally this &quot;develop at home&quot; issue. Thousands of small 
&amp;gt; companies ended up having random small internal workloads where it was easy to just get a random 
&amp;gt; whitebox PC and run some silly small thing on it yourself. Then as the workload expanded, it 
&amp;gt; became a &quot;real server&quot;. And then once that thing expanded, suddenly it made a whole lot of sense 
&amp;gt; to let somebody else manage the hardware and hosting, and the cloud took over.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Do you really not understand? This isn't rocket science. This isn't some made up story. 
&amp;gt; This is literally what happened, and what killed all the RISC vendors, and made x86 be 
&amp;gt; the undisputed king of the hill of servers, to the point where everybody else is just 
&amp;gt; a rounding error. Something that sounded entirely fictional a couple of decades ago.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Without a development platform, ARM in the server space is never going to make it. Trying to sell a 
&amp;gt; 64-bit &quot;hyperscaling&quot; model is idiotic, when you don't have customers and you don't have workloads 
&amp;gt; because you never sold the small cheap box that got the whole market started in the first place.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The price advantage of ARM will never be there for ARM servers unless you get enough volume to make 
&amp;gt; up for the absolutely huge advantage in server volume that Intel has right now. Being a smaller die 
&amp;gt; with cheaper NRE doesn't matter one whit, when you can't make up for the development costs in volume. 
&amp;gt; Look at every ARM server offering so far: they were not only slower, they were more expensive!
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; And the power advantage is still largely theoretical and doesn't show very much on 
&amp;gt; a system level anyway, and is also entirely irrelevant if people end up willing to 
&amp;gt; pay more for an x86 box simply because it's what they developed their load on. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Which leaves absolutely no real advantage to ARM.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; This is basic economics.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; And the only way that changes is if you end up saying &quot;look, you can deploy more cheaply 
&amp;gt; on an ARM box, and here's the development box you can do your work on&quot;.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Actual hardware for developers is hugely important. I seriously claim 
&amp;gt; that this is why the PC took over, and why everything else died. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; So you can pooh-pooh it all you want, and say &quot;just cross-build&quot;, but as long as you do that, you're going 
&amp;gt; to be a tiny minority, and you don't see the big picture, and you're ignoring actual real history.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; And btw, calling this an &quot;unixoid&quot; mindset is just showing what a total disconnect to reality 
&amp;gt; you have, and how stupid your argument is. Unix lost. Yes, it lives on in the shape of Linux, 
&amp;gt; but Unix lost not just to Linux, but to Windows. In fact, arguably it lost to windows first.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Why? Same exact reason, just on the software side. In both cases. Where did you find developers? 
&amp;gt; You found them on Windows and on Linux, because that's what developers had access to. When those 
&amp;gt; workloads grew up to be &quot;real&quot; workloads, they continued to be run on Windows and Linux, they weren't 
&amp;gt; moved over to Unix platforms even if that would have been fairly easy in the Linux case. No, that 
&amp;gt; was just unnecessary and pointless work. Just continue to deploy on the same platform.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Exact same issue on the software side as with the hardware. Cross-development is pointless 
&amp;gt; and stupid when the alternative is to just develop and deploy on the same platform. Yes, 
&amp;gt; you can do it, but you generally would like to avoid it if at all possible.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; End result: cross-development is mainly done for platforms that are so weak as to make it 
&amp;gt; pointless to develop on them. Nobody does native development in the embedded space. But whenever 
&amp;gt; the target is powerful enough to support native development, there's a huge pressure to 
&amp;gt; do it that way, because the cross-development model is so relatively painful.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The corollary to the above is that yes, cross-development is also done when the target environment 
&amp;gt; is too expensive to do native development on. That was the case for the big iron and traditional 
&amp;gt; big Unix boxes. But that seriously erodes support for the expensive platform, and makes the cheap 
&amp;gt; development platform much more able and likely to grow up into that space.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; It's why x86 won. Do you really think the world has changed radically?
