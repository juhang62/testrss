<title>A one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;We’re implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of Amazon’s facial recognition technology. We will continue to allow organizations like Thorn, the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Marinus Analytics to use Amazon Rekognition to help rescue human trafficking victims and reunite missing children with their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zoom closes account of U.S.-based Chinese activist after Tiananmen event</title>
<link>https://www.axios.com/zoom-closes-chinese-user-account-tiananmen-square-f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.axios.com/zoom-closes-chinese-user-account-tiananmen-square-f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. video-conferencing company Zoom closed the account of a group of prominent U.S.-based Chinese activists after they held a Zoom event commemorating the &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;31st anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/china-tiananmen-square-anniversary-photos-ba82a6be-cf26-434f-9ac6-8200fb122414.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/china-tiananmen-square-anniversary-photos-ba82a6be-cf26-434f-9ac6-8200fb122414.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;31st anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen&lt;/a&gt; Square Massacre, Axios has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Zoom has faced growing scrutiny over security concerns and its ties to China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; A Zoom spokesperson confirmed to Axios that the account had been closed &quot;to comply with local law&quot; and said it had now been re-activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just like any global company, we must comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions where we operate. When a meeting is held across different countries, the participants within those countries are required to comply with their respective local laws. We aim to limit the actions we take to those necessary to comply with local law and continuously review and improve our process on these matters. We have reactivated the US-based account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;— Zoom statement&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Between the lines:&lt;/strong&gt; This suggests Zoom closed the account due to concerns in China, which forbids free discussion of the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt; Zhou Fengsuo, founder of the U.S. nonprofit Humanitarian China and former student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, organized the May 31 event held through a paid Zoom account associated with Humanitarian China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 250 people attended the event. Speakers included mothers of students killed during the 1989 crackdown, organizers of Hong Kong's Tiananmen candlelight vigil, and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On June 7th, the Zoom account displayed a message that it had been shut down, in a screenshot viewed by Axios. Zhou has not been able to access the account since then, and Zoom has not responded to his emails, he told Axios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A second Zoom account belonging to a pro-democracy activist, Lee Cheuk Yan, a former Hong Kong politician and pro-democracy activist, was also closed in late May. Lee has also received no response from Zoom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What they're saying:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We are outraged by this act from Zoom, a U.S company,&quot; Zhou and other organizers told Axios in a statement. &quot;As the most commercially popular meeting software worldwide, Zoom is essential as an unbanned outreach to Chinese audiences remembering and commemorating Tiananmen Massacre during the coronavirus pandemic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese pro-democracy activists and dissidents face harassment and surveillance even beyond China's borders. U.S. companies with a presence in China have also faced scrutiny for their handling of content deemed sensitive by Chinese authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2019, LinkedIn &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;blocked&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-linkedin-zhou-fengsuo&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-linkedin-zhou-fengsuo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; Zhou's account from being visible in China, telling him in a message it was because of &quot;specific content on your profile.&quot; LinkedIn restored his account after &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;media attention&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2180620/linkedin-adhering-beijings-rules-censors-chinese-profile-page-us-based&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2180620/linkedin-adhering-beijings-rules-censors-chinese-profile-page-us-based&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;media attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom has skyrocketed to global prominence&lt;/strong&gt; during the coronavirus epidemic, going &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;from 10 million users to over 300 million&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/zoom-revenues-and-profit-soar-as-pandemic-propels-videoconferencing-ec115ea5-05ba-48e3-98bf-4df8478861b6.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/zoom-revenues-and-profit-soar-as-pandemic-propels-videoconferencing-ec115ea5-05ba-48e3-98bf-4df8478861b6.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;from 10 million users to over 300 million&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of months. Its meteoric rise has brought increased scrutiny to its ties to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The company has acknowledged that much of its product development has been based in China, and that some Zoom calls were accidentally &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;routed&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/zoom-concedes-custom-encryption-is-sub-standard-as-citizen-lab-pokes-holes-in-it/&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/zoom-concedes-custom-encryption-is-sub-standard-as-citizen-lab-pokes-holes-in-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;routed&lt;/a&gt; through Chinese servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;said&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it found serious concerns over Zoom's security protocols, and said the company's large workforce in China could make it &quot;responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government of &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;Taiwan&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-07/taiwan-bans-government-use-of-zoom-over-cybersecurity-concerns#:~:text=Taiwan%20barred%20all%20official%20use,said%20in%20a%20statement%20Tuesday.&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-07/taiwan-bans-government-use-of-zoom-over-cybersecurity-concerns#:~:text=Taiwan%20barred%20all%20official%20use,said%20in%20a%20statement%20Tuesday.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; banned official use of Zoom due to security concerns, and &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;schools in New York State&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-senate-german-government-tell-staff-not-to-use-zoom/&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-senate-german-government-tell-staff-not-to-use-zoom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;schools in New York State&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Senate, and the German ministry of foreign affairs have discouraged or restricted its use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in early June that the company has chosen &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;not to end-to-end encrypt&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/03/zoom-privacy-law-enforcement-technology-yuan&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/03/zoom-privacy-law-enforcement-technology-yuan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not to end-to-end encrypt&lt;/a&gt; free calls in order to cooperate with law enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to watch:&lt;/strong&gt; In May, Zoom announced that it would no longer provide free accounts to China-based users, &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;citing&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Zoom-suspends-free-service-to-individuals-in-China#:~:text=As%20of%20May%201%2C%20individual,be%20able%20to%20host%20meetings&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Zoom-suspends-free-service-to-individuals-in-China#:~:text=As%20of%20May%201%2C%20individual,be%20able%20to%20host%20meetings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;citing&lt;/a&gt; &quot;regulatory requirements.&quot; The company continues to sell paid accounts in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go deeper:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-content-click&quot; data-vars-link-text=&quot;China’s spy agencies are coming to Hong Kong&quot; data-vars-click-url=&quot;https://www.axios.com/china-hong-kong-intelligence-1cf65913-ccca-4279-994e-929c31eb3209.html&quot; data-vars-content-id=&quot;f218fed1-69af-4bdd-aac4-7eaf67f34084&quot; data-vars-headline=&quot;Zoom closed account of U.S.-based Chinese activist “to comply with local law”&quot; data-vars-event-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-sub-category=&quot;story&quot; data-vars-item=&quot;in_content_link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/china-hong-kong-intelligence-1cf65913-ccca-4279-994e-929c31eb3209.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;China’s spy agencies are coming to Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to include a response from Zoom and to clarify that Zoom does encrypt free calls, but not end-to-end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>You can bypass YouTube ads by adding a dot after the domain</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;Obviously this is the least popular route for blocking ads, but i just pay for youtube premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;A portion of my monthly fee is supposed to be distributed to content creators to offset their ad revenue, i havent seen an ad regardless of my blocker in years on any platform, 6 accounts is cheap af (i give the extras to friends), and they have a spotify alternative that can just aggregate youtube videos (meaning basically every song ever made is on it, and playlists just play on youtube, making sharing them mad easy). Plus screen off audio and offline play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM&quot;&gt;People dunk on youtube premium, but it makes more sense than ad block avenues for me.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intel Discloses Lakefield CPUs Specifications</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/15841/intel-discloses-lakefield-cpus-specifications-64-execution-units-up-to-30-ghz-7-w</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/15841/intel-discloses-lakefield-cpus-specifications-64-execution-units-up-to-30-ghz-7-w</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months, Intel has slowly started to disclose information about its first hybrid x86 platform, Lakefield. This new processor combines one ‘big’ CPU core with four ‘small’ CPU cores, along with a hefty chunk of graphics, with Intel setting out to deliver a new computing form factor. Highlights for this processor include its small footprint, due to new 3D stacking ‘Foveros’ technology, as well as its low standby SoC power, as low as 2.5 mW, which Intel states is 91% lower than previous low power Intel processors. Today’s announcement comes in two parts: first, the specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/Lake_678x452.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/Lake_678x452_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel will debut these two SKUs in its first generation of Lakefield. These CPUs will find homes in premium, always-connected laptops, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/15819/samsung-unveils-intel-galaxy-book-s-intels-lakefield-inbound&quot;&gt;Samsung Galaxy Book S&lt;/a&gt; expected in markets this month, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/15280/lenovos-thinkpad-x1-fold-combining-foldable-displays-5g-and-lakefield-into-a-laptop&quot;&gt;Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;, coming later this year, and in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/15223/intel-lakefield-today-lakefield-refresh-by-holiday-2020-possible-5g-on-foveros&quot;&gt;Microsoft Surface Book Neo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both SKUs will feature one big ‘Sunny Cove’ CPU core, along with four little ‘Tremont’ Atom CPU cores. Both sets of cores will have access to a 4 MB last level cache, although Intel has not yet disclosed what sort of cache this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile on the graphics front, Intel is integrating a Gen11 GPU with 64 execution units, the same number of EUs as on Intel's Ice Lake processors. Interestingly, the iGPU is clocked about half as high as usual for an Intel GPU, with clockspeeds peaking at just 500 MHz – suggesting that Intel is going wide and slow to increase graphics performance. Both CPUs will be rated for a TDP of 7 W.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;48 EUs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4267&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7 W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel confirmed to us that the base frequency is the unified frequency across all five cores, and the single core turbo frequency applies only to the big Sunny Cove core. Support for LPDDR4X-4266 is a notch above the memory controller in Ice Lake, which only runs at LPDDR4X-3733, and the memory speed will likely be a big boost to performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/Foveros%20%281%29.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/Foveros%20%281%29_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to enable these processors in a small 12mm x 12mm footprint, Intel is using its 3D stacking technology, called Foveros. This means that the logic areas of the chip, such as the cores and the graphics, sit on a 10+ nm die, while the IO parts of the chip are on a 22nm silicon die, and they are stacked together. In order to make the connections work, Intel has enabled 50 micron connection pads between the two silicon halves, along with power-focused TSVs (through silicon vias) in order to power the cores on the top layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/HC31_2.10_LKF_HC_2019_Final_v7-page-015.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/HC31_2.10_LKF_HC_2019_Final_v7-page-015_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel lists the TDP for these chips at 7 W, although the company has not disclosed the turbo power limits for the chip. As mentioned above, Intel hasn’t disclosed how the cache works. In the initial diagrams, we were shown that PoP memory would be added on top, and while Intel hasn't offered further details there, we know from last month's Samsung Galaxy Book S reveal that there will be (at least) 8GB SKUs using LPDDR4X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have big questions as to how each of the cores will work, given that by default they support different instruction sets – Intel hasn’t provided information on this at this time. Intel has stated that the scheduling of the threads on the different parts of the CPU will occur based on hardware-guided OS scheduling, although again Intel hasn’t gone into the details of its hardware tracking and enablement on how this is done. In the demos we have seen, Lakefield will use the Tremont cores for almost everything, and only call on the Sunny Cove core for user-experience type of interactions, such as typing or interacting with the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/06_TP_X1_Fold_Hero_Front_Clamsell_Pen.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15841/06_TP_X1_Fold_Hero_Front_Clamsell_Pen_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel is planning a post-announcement briefing for press to ask questions, which means that this announcement is coming in two parts. This is the information we’re being given beforehand, and we will update you with the details from the post-announcement briefing. As part of this process, we’ve exclaimed to Intel how this way around of presenting details to the press is frustrating – firstly for readers, as you all will have to come back if you want to find out what more Intel tells us later today, but secondly for us, as press, who will have to scramble to jump on the details and decide whether to write fast and miss details, or write slow and miss the wave of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we can confirm in advance – the Sunny Cove does not appear to be AVX-512 enabled. Intel’s initial press release states that AI workloads occur on the CPU; given the extra power draw required for AVX-512, this is probably a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information out of Intel’s post-announcement press-briefing will come later today.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YOLOv5: State-of-the-art object detection at 140 FPS</title>
<link>https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov5-is-here/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov5-is-here/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;less-than-50-days-after-the-release-yolov4-yolov5-improves-state-of-the-art-for-realtime-object-detection-&quot;&gt;Less than 50 days after the release YOLOv4, YOLOv5 improves state-of-the-art for realtime object detection.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Realtime object detection is improving quickly. The &lt;em&gt;rate of improvement&lt;/em&gt; is improving even more quickly. The results are stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 18, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/18/google-ai-open-sources-efficientdet-for-state-of-the-art-object-detection/&quot;&gt;open sourced&lt;/a&gt; their implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/efficientdet&quot;&gt;EfficientDet&lt;/a&gt;, a fast-training model with various sizes, one of which offers realtime output. On April 23, Alexey Bochoviskiy et al. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934&quot;&gt;open sourced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov4&quot;&gt;YOLOv4&lt;/a&gt;. On June 9, Glenn Jocher &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5&quot;&gt;open sourced&lt;/a&gt; an implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5&quot;&gt;YOLOv5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-yolo-models&quot;&gt;The Evolution of YOLO Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of models that PJ Reddie originally coined with a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf&quot;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;. YOLO models are infamous for being highly performant yet incredibly small – making them ideal candidates for realtime conditions and on-device deployment environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PJ Reddie's research team is responsible for subsequently introducing YOLOv2 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolo-v3-pytorch&quot;&gt;YOLOv3&lt;/a&gt;, both of which made continued improvement in both model performance and model speed. In February 2020, PJ Reddie noted he would discontinue research in computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2020, Alexey Bochkovskiy, Chien-Yao Wang, and Hong-Yuan Mark Liao introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov4&quot;&gt;YOLOv4&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating impressive gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/yolov4-results.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Image via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934.pdf&quot;&gt;YOLOv4 paper&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Notably, many of YOLOv4's improvements came from improved &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov4-data-augmentation/&quot;&gt;data augmentation&lt;/a&gt; as much as model architecture. (We've written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.roboflow.ai/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/&quot;&gt;breakdown on YOLOv4&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.roboflow.ai/training-yolov4-on-a-custom-dataset/&quot;&gt;how to train a YOLOv4 model on custom objects&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yolov5-the-leader-in-realtime-object-detection&quot;&gt;YOLOv5: The Leader in Realtime Object Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn Jocher released &lt;a href=&quot;https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5&quot;&gt;YOLOv5&lt;/a&gt; with a number of differences and improvements. (Notably, Glenn is the creator of mosaic augmentation, which is an included technique in what improved YOLOv4.) The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5&quot;&gt;release of YOLOv5&lt;/a&gt; includes five different models sizes: YOLOv5s (smallest), YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x (largest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's breakdown YOLOv5. How does YOLOv5 compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this is the first native release of models in the YOLO family to be written in PyTorch first rather than PJ Reddie's Darknet. Darknet is an incredibly flexible research framework, but it is not built with production environments in mind. It has a smaller community of users. Taken together, this results in Darknet being more challenging to configure and less production-ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because YOLOv5 is implemented in PyTorch initially, it benefits from the established PyTorch ecosystem: support is simpler, and deployment is easier. Moreover as a more widely known research framework, iterating on YOLOv5 may be easier for the broader research community. This also makes deploying to mobile devices simpler as the model can be compiled to ONNX and CoreML with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, YOLOv5 is fast – blazingly fast. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gDZ2xcTOgR39tGGs-EZ6i3RTs16wmzZQ#scrollTo=GD9gUQpaBxNa&quot;&gt;YOLOv5 Colab notebook&lt;/a&gt;, running a Tesla P100, we saw inference times up to 0.007 seconds per image, meaning &lt;strong&gt;140 frames per second (FPS)&lt;/strong&gt;! By contrast, YOLOv4 achieved 50 FPS after having been converted to the same Ultralytics PyTorch library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, YOLOv5 is accurate. In our tests on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd&quot;&gt;blood cell count and detection (BCCD) dataset&lt;/a&gt;, we achieved roughly 0.895 mean average precision (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/&quot;&gt;mAP&lt;/a&gt;) after training for just 100 epochs. Admittedly, we saw comparable performance from EfficientDet and YOLOv4, but it is rare to see such across-the-board performance improvements without any loss in accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, YOLOv5 is small. Specifically, a weights file for YOLOv5 is 27 megabytes. Our weights file for YOLOv4 (with Darknet architecture) is 244 megabytes. &lt;strong&gt;YOLOv5 is nearly 90 percent smaller&lt;/strong&gt; than YOLOv4. This means YOLOv5 can be deployed to embedded devices much more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these changes are well-summarized in YOLOv5's graphic measuring performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/yolov5-performance.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;YOLO is more accurate and faster than EfficientDet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5&quot;&gt;Credit: Glenn Jocher&lt;/a&gt;

<title>AWS Ruins Own Attempt at Sabotage</title>
<link>https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-ruins-own-attempt-at-sabotage/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-ruins-own-attempt-at-sabotage/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s analysis on multi-cloud being a bad idea is once &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; pushed back by breaking news. In this case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-sues-former-aws-marketing-vp-brian-hall-accepts-google-cloud-job/&quot;&gt;AWS is suing&lt;/a&gt; a former executive, Brian Hall, under his non-compete agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve covered my thoughts on non-compete agreements in the past—it was the driver behind my decision &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/why-i-turned-down-an-aws-job-offer/&quot;&gt;to decline an AWS job offer several years ago&lt;/a&gt;—but I wanted to revisit them in light of this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with covering what the current situation is. Brian (I know him, so I can’t really refer to him as “schmoo” the way I referenced the defendant in my previous article on non-competes) was AWS’s VP of Product Marketing. He resigned from AWS and accepted a job as the VP of Product Marketing at Google Cloud. This is not in dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic example of the distributed nature of Amazon getting in its own way. Sending the person who runs AWS Product Marketing to fill the same role at a competing company is a breathtakingly beautiful act of corporate sabotage. I mean, think about it: What’s the secret sauce he’s going to take with him? “Release a bunch of things with terrible names then market them incredibly poorly to infrastructure engineers?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is, to be direct, not an AWS core strength. Having someone high up within that organization leaving for a competitor is a terrific way to ensure that they don’t get leapfrogged by that competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, AWS Legal missed a memo and has filed a lawsuit—which is the exact wrong move here. The right move would have been to give him a glowing recommendation and send him a fruit basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, AWS has now found themselves in the headlines again for an unforced error that makes anyone with other job options reconsider accepting an offer—or even interviewing at AWS at all. The damage that this blunder is doing on multiple fronts is incalculable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, my commentary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Brian was AWS’s VP of Product Marketing. If you take a look at the scattershot marketing message around the plethora of AWS service offerings, the executive ultimately responsible for it all should, rather than being poached by a competitor, be immediately placed on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themuse.com/advice/every-question-about-being-on-performance-improvement-plan&quot;&gt;PIP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, what Brian was reportedly told when accepting the job by Ariel Kelman (at the time, AWS’s VP of Global Marketing) was to the effect of “oh, don’t worry; AWS has never enforced that non-compete clause against someone at your level/in your role/in this department.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I encountered the same responses from AWS during my job offer situation, the attorney I spoke with laughed at that. “Of course they’re going to say that; it’s not legally binding and they want you to say &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;. If they’re serious about that, they can put it in writing. If they don’t, you don’t want to sign it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS’s response was, unsurprisingly, “take it or leave it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I point out further that the non-compete is still scoped to all of Amazon rather than just AWS. It’s overbroad and could conceivably apply against Brian in virtually any job he were to reasonably accept for the remainder of the 18-month period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen some objections to my position in the past couple of days; allow me to turn them into strawmen and summarily dismiss them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brian is taking the exact same job at Google! This is what non-competes are for!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. It’s a perfect test case for whether King County wants to see non-competes as congruent with public policy. It’s also a useful public datapoint as to why second guessing a role at AWS that isn’t in California might be in any given candidate’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it’s worth noting that, rather than scoping their non-compete agreements narrowly, AWS leaves them as broad as possible. It’s up to the judge in any given case to determine potential restrictions, ultimately leaving the taxpayers of King County responsible for the costs of arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s only for 18 months!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a long time in cloud. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/google-reportedly-wants-to-be-top-two-player-in-cloud-by-2023.html&quot;&gt;GCP may well be deprecated&lt;/a&gt; before then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, I’d be in favor of a model wherein if AWS chose to enforce the non-compete, they’d be required to pay the former employee their full compensation for the duration of the restriction. That’s how it works in Europe, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AWS didn’t enforce the agreement against Ariel Kelman when he went to Oracle as their Chief Marketing Officer!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariel also lives in California, where non-compete agreements are almost universally considered unenforceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Cloud isn’t a serious competitor to AWS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this lawsuit, I would have agreed with you! AWS’s consideration of GCP as “a competitive cloud business” is the sort of admission that GCP should put up as a testimonial on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, I think that AWS may not have thought “filing a lawsuit against one of the best marketers they were able to hire” all the way through. I’ll be disappointed if this quietly drifts away without doing serious damage to AWS’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;At the VP level, the risk of not having to work is baked into the high salary they pay you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s AWS. They embrace “frugality” as a leadership principle. To that end, arguably the most surprising line in the complaint was this: “In 2019, Hall earned well in excess of one hundred thousand dollars per year, annualized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with Google, whose compensation for VPs is astronomical even before you factor in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/25/google-andy-rubin-android-creator-payoff-sexual-misconduct-report&quot;&gt;the monstrous severance pay&lt;/a&gt; they receive before leaving under credible allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Without this agreement, what’s to stop Brian from taking Amazon’s confidential information to Google?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NDA that’s enforceable in every jurisdiction, for one. A “functioning set of ethics” for another. Or is Amazon saying here that they don’t have a high ethical bar for its executive hires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon certainly hires people for strategic roles from competing companies. Nobody is suggesting that Amazon is leveraging trade secrets when they do this because it’s understood in business that this happens, and that people comport themselves ethically. When they don’t, it makes headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further note that Ariel, the person who Brian reported to, was based in California. If this were as big of an issue as is suggested, AWS would never have agreed to have such a strategic role filled by someone in a jurisdiction where the non-compete couldn’t be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pains me to say it, as I genuinely like most of what AWS does. But the takeaway here for anyone considering a role at AWS is this: &lt;strong&gt;No one is safe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other takeaways to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re never nicer to you then when they’re trying to hire you. If they mock your concerns about the non-compete? RUN. Amazon is apparently incredibly easily scorned. They will hurl fire after departed employees and use their own reputation as kindling. Brian Hall is the greatest cloud marketer in the world. He hasn’t even started yet, and he’s already made a Google job offer more compelling than its equivalent at AWS by a landslide. He’s gotten me saying nice things about Google—and that shouldn’t be possible! Non-competes are clearly being used to provide a chilling effect for their existing employees. Very few companies will go up against Amazon in a courtroom; it’s far easier for most to simply withdraw the offer and select another candidate. I can’t abide a bully. If, after losing your job, you can’t afford to weather an 18-month period in which your ability to work for any company Amazon deems to be a competitor, you should probably look into working elsewhere. There’s absolutely nothing in the non-compete that says your departure must be voluntary. If AWS had decided to fire Brian for any reason, they could just have easily have brought this same suit against him. Both Brian and I are the very whitest of guys, steeped in the purest expression possible of techbro privilege. If this is how it plays out when someone with that overwhelming accelerator pushes back, imagine how it might impact people of color, women, and other folks who aren’t dramatically overrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-competes are bad news for everyone. The incredibly talented folks at AWS deserve better, massive amounts of goodwill among AWS’s candidate pool are being torched by moves like this, and I fail to see any way that this situation benefits customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think I’ve gotten it wrong, okay: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/&quot;&gt;make your case on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>AWS Ruins Own Attempt at Sabotage - Last Week in AWS</og:title>
<og:description>This week’s analysis on multi-cloud being a bad idea is once again pushed back by breaking news. In this case, AWS is suing a former executive, Brian Hall, under his non-compete agreement. I’ve covered my thoughts on non-compete agreements in the past—it was the driver behind my decision to decline an AWS job offer several …</og:description>

<title>Advice to new managers: don&amp;#039;t joke about firing people</title>
<link>https://staysaasy.com/engineering/2020/06/09/Don%27t-Joke.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://staysaasy.com/engineering/2020/06/09/Don%27t-Joke.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most narrow pieces of feedback I give to people being promoted to manager is simple - don’t joke about firing people. When I deliver this feedback people will often respond with some form of befuddlement: “I wasn’t planning to”, “Ummm….OK”, “Obviously”. However, this feedback is driven by knowledge of mistakes made by a number of new managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people get promoted to manager their former peers become direct reports. It’s awkward. They try to break the tension with self deprecation and poking fun at the newfound responsibility. That “haha I’m the bureaucrat now what a joke this is” attitude carries through each new day and eventually some situation arises where a report makes some sort of gaffe. They spill their coffee. They accidentally let a door close in your face. Their computer runs out of battery in a meeting. And then it happens: “that’s it, pack your things and go, you’re out of here buddy”. Or some other joke about their termination from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it’s innocuous, but it’s not. The second you became their manager you forfeited the right to joke around in any capacity about their employment at the company. Even though you still feel like a pal joking around, even though the fact that you’d make the joke at all is a testament to your discomfort with having to make firing decisions, it’s not something you can ever joke about. People don’t find it funny because it’s not funny. The ability to terminate someone’s employment is a big deal. Treat it that way, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this sort of break-the-awkwardness mistake can be made at other, even more inappropriate times. Anything causing discomfort in the air - from COVID-19 to police brutality and beyond - is an opportunity for a manager to try and break the discomfort where it’s not appropriate. The advice is simple: don’t kid about serious things. Even if you think the spirit of the comment is clearly in support of your team or well meaning. Don’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wikipedia Lost 3B Organic Search Visits to Google in 2019</title>
<link>https://hackernoon.com/how-wikipedia-lost-3-billion-organic-search-visits-to-google-in-2019-qz6630u6</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;sc-fzoyAV jxhexg&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 10th 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sc-fzqBZW cIcUqZ profile&quot; readability=&quot;5.175&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/u/SimilarWeb&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/avatars/TFC246SKw3g7mrEtXNAerToq9dx2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Author profile picture&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;6.0375&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/u/SimilarWeb&quot; class=&quot;sc-fznyAO hVtsuD&quot;&gt;@SimilarWeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;SimilarWeb&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry standard for measuring the digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Wikipedia was founded in 2001, people worldwide rely on the online encyclopedia to expand their horizons and read information on just about anything. As true as that is today, however, the site’s traffic trends tell a very different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, its traffic has been decreasing, a pattern that swiftly accelerated in 2019. We'll look into how, and why, Wikipedia is experiencing such a decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Numbers Behind the Traffic Loss: Wikipedia Desktop Traffic Explored&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;12.247588424437&quot;&gt;Over the past 24 months, Wikipedia has lost billions of monthly organic visitors to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/how-zero-click-searches-are-impacting-your-seo-strategy/?ref=hackernoon.com&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;zero-click results&lt;/a&gt;. What are zero-click results? It's when a user searched in Google, and found a direct answer to his or her search (often at the top of the first search results page) without needing to visit any actual site.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at its desktop traffic alone we see that in January 2019, the site won 2.2 billion visits, a number that dropped dramatically to 1.9 billion by January 2020 (a decrease of -14%). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the site still has billions of monthly visitors, those visits are becoming increasingly more difficult to win as evidenced by the decline. While zero-click search results are primarily responsible for this trend, they aren’t completely to blame for the site’s traffic drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube videos rank at the top of Google’s knowledge graph, and are often also among the top organic search results, making it Wikipedia’s fiercest competitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Zero-Click Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;10.876254180602&quot;&gt;Google introduced &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Graphs&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Direct Answers&lt;/strong&gt; in 2015, which is when the decline in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/wikipedia-google-penalty/?ref=hackernoon.com&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;organic traffic to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; was first noticed. This change took away any need to click on a specific link to see the desired results; therefore, &lt;em&gt;search queries began ending with “zero-click” results&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this has been very convenient for searchers, as traffic to Wikipedia shows, it has been less than ideal for businesses. Out of nearly 890,000 monthly searches worldwide, only 30,000 actually become search visits to a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick look at a basic search of the weather forecast in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Googling &quot;weather in Los Angeles&quot;, the data above was provided by weather.com. However, it's obvious that any searcher is able to get the answer to the question without clicking through to the actual site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact on traffic is staggering – only 15% of weather in Los Angeles searches actually result in a click and a consequent visit to weather.com.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that 85% of people see this weather forecast display at the top of the page, and never follow through to click on any search results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Freddie Mercury: Wikipedia’s Best Keyword Analyzed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I won’t be a rockstar. I will be a legend.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand this declining trend, let's look at Wikipedia’s top 20 organic keywords. Wikipedia’s most valuable search keywords are for celebrities, movies, and TV series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural next step is to dive into its top-performing keyword, &quot;Freddie Mercury&quot;, to see what traffic patterns show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Freddie Mercury died in 1991, long before Wikipedia was founded, his name has become the site’s top-performing keyword in 2020. A quick Google query of his name pulls up a plethora of information about him, including his Wiki page, YouTube videos, and loads of news articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, 71% of those searches end there, without a click to a specific site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the organic mobile traffic for the search reveals zero-click results have cost Wikipedia’s English language subdomain tens of millions of organic visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whopping decline has been more apparent on mobile devices when Google shows an answer. This is because on mobile the search results don't often show any other results, whereas on desktop, other results are displayed below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, Where Has Wikipedia’s Traffic Gone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;paragraph&quot; readability=&quot;8.7398843930636&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/google-steals-over-550-million-clicks-from-wikipedia-in-6-months/?ref=hackernoon.com&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored&quot;&gt;2015,&lt;/a&gt; Google was able to steal over 550 million clicks from Wikipedia in six months, and here we are five years later watching that trend accelerate at breakneck speed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many factors are contributing to that decrease, the vast majority of Wikipedia’s traffic has been lost to Google’s zero click results, emphasizing just how much power Google has over search traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
