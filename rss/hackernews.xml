<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLbiwZi1t7w&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;earnest&lt;/a&gt; public-information campaigns, Americans are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;finally recycling&lt;/a&gt;. Airports, malls, schools, and office buildings across the country have bins for plastic bottles and aluminum cans and newspapers. In some cities, you can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/recycling-enforcement/396734/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;fined&lt;/a&gt; if inspectors discover that you haven’t recycled appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now much of that carefully sorted recycling is ending up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, we were sending the bulk of our recycling to China—tons and tons of it, sent over on ships to be made into goods such as shoes and bags and new plastic products. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/impl_03oct17_e.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;But last year, the country restricted&lt;/a&gt; imports of certain recyclables, including mixed paper—magazines, office paper, junk mail—and most plastics. Waste-management companies across the country are telling towns, cities, and counties that there is no longer a market for their recycling. These municipalities have two choices: pay much higher rates to get rid of recycling, or throw it all away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most are choosing the latter. “We are doing our best to be environmentally responsible, but we can’t afford it,” said Judie Milner, the city manager of Franklin, New Hampshire. Since 2010, Franklin has offered curbside recycling and encouraged residents to put paper, metal, and plastic in their green bins. When the program launched, Franklin could break even on recycling by selling it for $6 a ton. Now, Milner told me, the transfer station is charging the town $125 a ton to recycle, or $68 a ton to incinerate. One-fifth of Franklin’s residents live &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhes.nh.gov/elmi/products/cp/profiles-htm/franklin.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;below the poverty line&lt;/a&gt;, and the city government didn’t want to ask them to pay more to recycle, so all those carefully sorted bottles and cans are being burned. Milner hates knowing that Franklin is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.no-burn.org/burning-plastic-incineration-causes-air-pollution-dioxin-emissions-cost-overruns/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;releasing toxins&lt;/a&gt; into the environment, but there’s not much she can do. “Plastic is just not one of the things we have a market for,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is happening across the country. Broadway, Virginia, had a recycling program for 22 years, but recently suspended it after Waste Management told the town that prices would increase by 63 percent, and then stopped offering recycling pickup as a service. “It almost feels illegal, to throw plastic bottles away,” the town manager, Kyle O’Brien, told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a market for mixed paper, bales of the stuff started to pile up in Blaine County, Idaho; the county eventually stopped collecting it and took the 35 bales it had hoped to recycle to a landfill. The town of Fort Edward, New York, &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststar.com/news/local/after-town-s-halt-of-recycling-services-fort-edward-village/article_f6b3d677-baaf-53bb-a7de-3dac622e5534.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; its recycling program in July and admitted it had actually been taking recycling to an incinerator for months. Determined to hold out until the market turns around, the nonprofit Keep Northern Illinois Beautiful has collected 400,000 tons of plastic. But for now, it is piling the bales behind the facility where it collects plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This end of recycling comes at a time when the United States is creating more waste than ever. In 2015, the most recent year for which national data are available, America generated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/2015_smm_msw_factsheet_07242018_fnl_508_002.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;262.4 million&lt;/a&gt; tons of waste, up 4.5 percent from 2010 and 60 percent from 1985. That amounts to nearly five pounds per person a day. New York City &lt;a href=&quot;https://dsny.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/about_dsny-curbside-collections-FY2018-1.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;collected&lt;/a&gt; 934 tons of metal, plastic, and glass a day from residents last year, a 33 percent increase from 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/online-shopping-and-accumulation-of-junk/567985/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: ‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/online-shopping-and-accumulation-of-junk/567985/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are all accumulating mountains of things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/online-shopping-and-accumulation-of-junk/567985/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Americans have had little incentive to consume less. It’s inexpensive to buy products, and it’s even cheaper to throw them away at the end of their short lives. But the costs of all this garbage are growing, especially now that bottles and papers that were once recycled are now ending up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those costs is environmental: When organic waste sits in a landfill, it decomposes, emitting methane, which is bad for the climate—landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions in the country. Burning plastic may create some energy, but it also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43120041&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;produces&lt;/a&gt; carbon emissions. And while many incineration facilities bill themselves as “waste to energy” plants, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grid.unep.ch/waste/html_file/42-43_climate_change.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that they release more harmful chemicals, such as mercury and lead, into the air per unit of energy than do coal plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as cities are now learning, the other cost is financial. The United States still has a fair amount of landfill space left, but it’s getting expensive to ship waste hundreds of miles to those landfills. Some dumps are raising costs to deal with all this extra waste; according to one estimate, along the West Coast, landfill fees increased by $8 a ton from 2017 to 2018. Some of these costs are already being passed on to consumers, but most haven’t—yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are going to have to come to terms with a new reality: All those toothpaste tubes and shopping bags and water bottles that didn’t exist 50 years ago need to go somewhere, and creating this much waste has a price we haven’t had to pay so far. “We’ve had an ostrich-in-the-sand approach to the entire system,” said Jeremy O’Brien, director of applied research at the Solid Waste Association of North America, a trade association. “We’re producing a lot of waste ourselves, and we should take care of it ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;c-section-divider&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the trash piles up, American cities are scrambling to figure out what to do with everything they had previously sent to China. But few businesses want it domestically, for one very big reason: Despite all those advertising campaigns, Americans are &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; at recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 25 percent of what ends up in the blue bins is contaminated, according to the National Waste &amp;amp; Recycling Association. For decades, we’ve been throwing just about whatever we wanted—wire hangers and pizza boxes and ketchup bottles and yogurt containers—into the bin and sending it to China, where low-paid workers sorted through it and cleaned it up. That’s no longer an option. And in the United States, at least, it rarely makes sense to employ people to sort through our recycling so that it can be made into new material, because virgin plastics and paper are still cheaper in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in San Francisco, often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/how-san-francisco-became-a-global-leader-in-waste-management.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;lauded&lt;/a&gt; for its environmentalism, waste-management companies struggle to keep recycling uncontaminated. I visited a state-of-the-art facility operated by San Francisco’s recycling provider, Recology, where million-dollar machines separate aluminum from paper from plastic from garbage. But as the Recology spokesman Robert Reed walked me through the plant, he kept pointing out nonrecyclables gumming up the works. Workers wearing masks and helmets grabbed laundry baskets off a fast-moving conveyor belt of cardboard as some non-cardboard items escaped their gloved hands. Recology has to stop another machine twice a day so a technician can pry plastic bags from where they’ve clogged up the gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/03/IMG_7772/8bea8d007.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Bales of plastic are piled at a Recology facility in San Francisco. (Alana Semuels / The Atlantic)
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning up recycling means employing people to slowly go through materials, which is expensive. Jacob Greenberg, a commissioner in Blaine County, Idaho, told me that the county’s mixed-paper recycling was about 90 percent clean. But its paper broker said the mixed paper needed to be 99 percent clean for anyone to buy it, and elected officials didn’t want to hike fees to get there. “At what point do you feel like you’re spending more money than what it takes for people to feel good about recycling?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the challenge of educating people about what can and can’t be recycled, even as the number of items they touch on a daily basis grows. Americans tend to be “aspirational” about their recycling, tossing an item in the blue bin because it makes them feel less guilty about consuming it and throwing it away. Even in San Francisco, Reed kept pointing out items that aren’t easily recyclable but that keep showing up at the Recology plant: soy-sauce packets and pizza boxes, candy-bar wrappers and dry-cleaner bags, the lids of to-go coffee cups and plastic take-out containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can somehow figure out how to better sort recycling, some U.S. markets for plastics and paper may emerge. But selling it domestically will still be harder than it would be in a place such as China, where a booming manufacturing sector has constant demand for materials. The viability of recycling varies tremendously by locale; San Francisco can recycle its glass back into bottles in six weeks, according to Recology, while many other cities are finding that glass is so heavy and breaks so easily that it is nearly impossible to truck it to a place that will recycle it. Akron, Ohio, is just one of many cities that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cleveland.com/akron/2018/12/akrons-ban-on-recycling-glass-based-on-faulty-information.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;have ended&lt;/a&gt; glass recycling since the China policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it’s still often cheaper for companies to manufacture using new materials than recycled ones. Michael Rohwer, a director at Business for Social Responsibility, works with companies that try to be more environmentally friendly. He told me that recycled plastic costs pennies more than new plastic, and those pennies add up when you’re manufacturing millions of items. Items made of different types of plastic nearly always end up in the trash, because recyclers can’t separate the plastics from one another—Reed equates it with trying to get the sugar and eggs out of a cake after you’ve baked it. But because companies don’t bear the costs of disposal, they have no incentive to manufacture products out of material that will be easier to recycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to fix recycling is probably persuading people to buy less stuff, which would also have the benefit of reducing some of the upstream waste created when products are made. But that’s a hard sell in the United States, where consumer spending accounts for 68 percent of the GDP. The strong economy means more people have more spending money, too, and often the things they buy, such as new phones, and the places they shop, such as Amazon, are designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/amazon-selling-machine/574045/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;sell them&lt;/a&gt; even more things. The average American spent 7 percent more on food and 8 percent more on personal-care products and services in 2017 than in 2016, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cesan.nr0.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;government data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/amazon-selling-machine/574045/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: The Amazon selling machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some places are still trying to get people to buy less. The city of San Francisco, for instance, is trying to get residents to think of a fourth &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; beyond “reduce, reuse, and recycle”—“refuse.” It wants people to be smarter about what they purchase, avoiding plastic bottles and straws and other disposable goods. But it’s been tough in a place centered on acquiring the newest technology. “This is our big challenge: How do you take a culture like San Francisco and get people excited about less?” Debbie Raphael, the director of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, told me. The city passed an ordinance that required that 10 percent of beverages sold be available in reusable containers, and it is trying to make reuse “hip” through an online campaign and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recology.com/better-at-the-bin/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'None'&quot;&gt;dedicated website&lt;/a&gt;, Raphael said. San Francisco and other Bay Area cities have banned plastic bags and plastic straws, but that option isn’t available in many other parts of the country, where recently passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/01/29/banning-the-bans-state-and-local-officials-clash-over-plastic-bags&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'20',r'None'&quot;&gt;state laws&lt;/a&gt; prevent cities from banning products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even in San Francisco, the most careful consumers still generate a lot of waste. Plastic clamshell containers are difficult to recycle because the material they’re made of is so flimsy—but it’s hard to find berries not sold in those containers, even at most farmers’ markets. Go into a Best Buy or Target in San Francisco to buy headphones or a charger, and you’ll still end up with plastic packaging to throw away. Amazon has tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/sustainability/packaging&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'21',r'None'&quot;&gt;reduce waste&lt;/a&gt; by sending products in white and blue plastic envelopes, but when I visited the Recology plant, they littered the floor because they’re very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/11/why-amazons-new-streamlined-packaging-is-jamming-up-recycling-centers/?utm_term=.508cb51285ba&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'22',r'None'&quot;&gt;hard to recycle&lt;/a&gt;. Even at Recology, an employee-owned company that benefits when people recycle well, the hurdles to getting rid of plastics were evident. Reed chided me for eating my daily Chobani yogurt out of small, five-ounce containers rather than out of big, 32-ounce tubs, but I saw a five-ounce Yoplait container in a trash can of the control room of the Recology plant. While there, Reed handed me a pair of small orange earplugs meant to protect my ears from the noise of the plant. They were wrapped in a type of flimsy plastic that is nearly impossible to recycle. When I left the plant, I kept the earplugs and the plastic in my bag, not sure what to do with them. Eventually, I threw them in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>US citizens will need a visa to visit Europe starting in 2021</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;Paragraph__cite&quot;&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;span&gt;US citizens visiting parts of Europe will need authorization from the European Union come 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Paragraph__component&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EU &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4367_en.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt; it was creating a European Travel Information and Authorization System, or ETIAS, that will require &quot;pre-travel screening for security and migration risks of travellers benefiting from visa-free access to the Schengen area.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Schengen Area is a zone of 26 European countries that do not have internal borders and allow people to move between them freely, including countries such as Spain, France, Greece, Germany, Italy and Poland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, US citizens can travel to Europe for up to 90 days without any sort of travel authorization. ETIAS will change that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Visa-free travelers, including US citizens, will need to request ETIAS authorization before visiting the Schengen Area. They can complete an application and pay a service fee of 7 euros (about $8) online. The authorization is valid for three years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Completing the online application should not take more than 10 minutes with automatic approval being given in over 95% of cases,&quot; the European Commission said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We are aware of the European Union's plan to implement its own travel information and authorization system, similar to the U.S. ESTA, to contribute to a more efficient management of the EU's external borders and improve internal security,&quot; a US State Department official said in a statement. &quot;Each country has the right to determine its standards for entry.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The official added that the &quot;ETIAS authorization is not a visa.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States won't be the only country affected by the changes. From 2021, citizens from 60 countries will be required to apply for the ETIAS before entering the Schengen Area. Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Israel and Mauritius are among those countries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The European Parliament agreed to establish ETIAS in July. At the time, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship, indicated that the requirement was put in place for security reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Paragraph__component&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The new ETIAS will ensure that we no longer have an information gap on visa-free travelers,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4367_en.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he said in a statement.&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Anyone who poses a migratory or security risk will be identified before they even travel to EU borders.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) as a visa. It is an authorization system. The story also incorrectly stated that this announcement was made on Friday. The headline and story have been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;dek&quot;&gt;Mechanical engineers have developed an “acoustic metamaterial” that can cancel 94 percent of sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bannerContainer bannerContainer-contentWidth&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.bu.edu/research/files/2019/02/resized-19-1023-SOUND-025.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boston University Ph. D. candidate Reza Ghaffarivardavagh poses with his research team.

&lt;h3 class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;byline-label&quot;&gt;By &lt;span class=&quot;byline-authors&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;byline-author vcard&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;Kat J. McAlpine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sounds would you mute if you could? A pair of Boston University mechanical engineers are asking that question, with the ever-increasing din of drone propellers, airplane turbines, MRI machines, and urban noise pollution blaring in the mind’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s sound barriers are literally thick heavy walls,” says Reza Ghaffarivardavagh. Although noise-mitigating barricades, called sound baffles, can help drown out the whoosh of rush hour traffic or contain the symphony of music within concert hall walls, they are a clunky approach not well suited to situations where airflow is also critical. Imagine barricading a jet engine’s exhaust vent—the plane would never leave the ground. Instead, workers on the tarmac wear earplugs to protect their hearing from the deafening roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xin Zhang and Ghaffarivardavagh were enticed by an alluring question: “Can we design a structure that can block noise but preserve air passage?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaning on their mathematical prowess and the technology of 3D printing, it turns out they can. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.024302&quot;&gt;January 2019 &lt;em&gt;Physical Review&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers argue that it’s quite possible to silence noise using an open, ringlike structure, created to mathematically perfect specifications, for cutting out sounds while maintaining airflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Numbers and noise control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always been interested in acoustics,” says Ghaffarivardavagh, who finished his BSc in mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, before coming to Boston University for graduate school. Now, in Zhang’s lab, he’s close to finishing his PhD. “I like to work on something that I can hear or see the result. Something that I can have an impact on with issues we are facing nowadays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lived in other major cities before coming to Boston, Zhang and Ghaffarivardavagh have always marveled at the layered urban soundscape enveloping them. In Boston, the cacophony of the city is garbled together from airplanes flying overhead, the engines and horns of cars, trucks, and buses on the street, the rumble and screech of MBTA trolleys, and the hum of building appliances and power sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City life is so noisy, you have to find a way to create quiet moments, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got them dreaming up a sound baffle that wasn’t a barrier at all, but instead an open conduit. Such a feat could only be possible by developing a material with unusual and unnatural properties (known as a metamaterial), in this case with the ability to exert an isolated influence on sounds—an acoustic metamaterial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been working on metamaterials for more than a decade,” says Zhang, a multidisciplinary professor at the College of Engineering and the Photonics Center. “But it was Reza that gradually got me more excited about the fundamental idea of a marriage between acoustics and metamaterials. If you ask me and my colleagues, acoustic metamaterials is a relatively young direction…. It’s the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mute button, incarnated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang let mathematics—a shared passion that has buoyed both of their engineering careers and made them well-suited research partners—guide them toward a workable design for what the acoustic metamaterial would look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sound is made by very tiny disturbances in the air. So, our goal is to silence those tiny vibrations,” Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang say. “If we want the inside of a structure to be open air, then we have to keep in mind that this will be the pathway through which sound travels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They calculated the dimensions and specifications that the metamaterial would need to have in order to interfere with the transmitted sound waves, preventing sound—but not air—from being radiated through the open structure. The basic premise is that the metamaterial needs to be shaped in such a way that it sends incoming sounds back to where they came from, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video-right&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;responsiveVideo-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;On one end of the pipe, a loudspeaker blasts a noise. On the other end, the open acoustic silencing metamaterial redirects the sound as long as it's fitted in place. Video courtesy of the Zhang lab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a test case, they decided to create a structure that could silence sound from a loudspeaker. Based on their calculations, they modeled the physical dimensions that would most effectively silence noises. Bringing those models to life, they used 3D printing to materialize an open, noise-canceling structure made of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying it out in the lab, the researchers sealed the loudspeaker into one end of a PVC pipe. On the other end, the tailor-made acoustic metamaterial was fastened into the opening. With the hit of the play button, the experimental loudspeaker set-up came oh-so-quietly to life in the lab. Standing in the room, based on your sense of hearing alone, you’d never know that the loudspeaker was blasting an irritatingly high-pitched note. If, however, you peered into the PVC pipe, you would see the loudspeaker’s subwoofers thrumming away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metamaterial, ringing around the internal perimeter of the pipe’s mouth, worked like a mute button incarnate until the moment when Ghaffarivardavagh reached down and pulled it free. The lab suddenly echoed with the screeching of the loudspeaker’s tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The moment we first placed and removed the silencer…was literally night and day,” says Jacob Nikolajczyk, who in addition to being a study coauthor and former undergraduate researcher in Zhang’s lab is a passionate vocal performer. “We had been seeing these sorts of results in our computer modeling for months—but it is one thing to see modeled sound pressure levels on a computer, and another to hear its impact yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing sound levels with and without the metamaterial fastened in place, the team found that they could silence nearly all—94 percent to be exact—of the noise, making the sounds emanating from the loudspeaker imperceptible to the human ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A quieter world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that their prototype has proved so effective, the researchers have some big ideas about how their acoustic-silencing metamaterial could go to work making the real world quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drones are a very hot topic,” Zhang says. Companies like Amazon are interested in using drones to deliver goods, she says, and “people are complaining about the potential noise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The culprit is the upward-moving fan motion,” Ghaffarivardavagh says. “If we can put sound-silencing open structures beneath the drone fans, we can cancel out the sound radiating toward the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;

Inside the outer ring, a helical pattern interferes with sounds, blocking them from transmitting through the open center while preserving air’s ability to flow through. Photo by Cydney Scott&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to home—or the office—fans and HVAC systems could benefit from acoustic metamaterials that render them silent yet still enable hot or cold air to be circulated unencumbered throughout a building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghaffarivardavagh and Zhang also point to the unsightliness of the sound barriers used today to reduce noise pollution from traffic and see room for an aesthetic upgrade. “Our structure is super lightweight, open, and beautiful. Each piece could be used as a tile or brick to scale up and build a sound-canceling, permeable wall,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape of acoustic-silencing metamaterials, based on their method, is also completely customizable, Ghaffarivardavagh says. The outer part doesn’t need to be a round ring shape in order to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can design the outer shape as a cube or hexagon, anything really,” he says. “When we want to create a wall, we will go to a hexagonal shape” that can fit together like an open-air honeycomb structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such walls could help contain many types of noises. Even those from the intense vibrations of an MRI machine, Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Stephan Anderson, a professor of radiology at BU School of Medicine and a coauthor of the study, the acoustic metamaterial could potentially be scaled “to fit inside the central bore of an MRI machine,” shielding patients from the sound during the imaging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhang says the possibilities are endless, since the noise mitigation method can be customized to suit nearly any environment: “The idea is that we can now mathematically design an object that can block the sounds of anything,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This work was supported by a Boston University Materials Innovation Grant and Dean’s Catalyst Award.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: My CV is also a bootloader</title>
<link>https://github.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader#</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader/master/demo.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjimenezmateo/curriculum-bootloader/master/demo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ScreenShot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PDF attached in this repository is both a working PDF of my CV and a custom bootloader created by me to impress technical recruiters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19344146&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Check the discussion in HN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a tiny bootloader of 1018 bytes. Then I just copy the first bytes of my bootloader at the beginning of my CV and that is it, a working PDF and bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I try it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! You can do so by two means, in real hardware (I spend a lot of time making it compatible) or in an emulated environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Real hardware&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; All the data on the USB will be lost, please make sure you have a backup before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Win32 Disk Imager&lt;/a&gt; and use the PDF as the input image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recover your USB just right click on it and format normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Linux&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Please be very careful with this command. If you select the wrong drive &lt;strong&gt;you will lose data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a USB, check the device name (you can use df -h) and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dd if=cv.pdf of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=2880
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where X is your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recover your USB just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://gparted.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gparted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Emulated environment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Qemu&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=cv.pdf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Bochs:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a bochsrc.txt file with this contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;megs: 32
romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xfffe0000
vgaromimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest
floppya: 1_44=cv.pdf, status=inserted
boot: a
log: bochsout.txt
mouse: enabled=0
display_library: x, options=&quot;gui_debug&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then execute bochs as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
bochs -f bochsrc.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compiling from source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
nasm boot.asm -o boot.bin
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your vanilla PDF, CV_english.pdf in this example, and do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
qpdf --stream-data=uncompress CV_english.pdf uncompressed.pdf
cat boot.bin uncompressed.pdf &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; cv.pdf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a learning experience. I realized that I had no practical knowledge on how the booting process works, and also my assembly was a little bit rusty. This is a project I really enjoyed, although it was a little bit overwhelming at some points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you explain how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried my best to comment the code thoroughly, including my optimization decisions as well as the encoding of the sprites. I have also linked to a couple of Stackoverflow answers for deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now your PDF is bigger!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, but 1018 bytes bigger or 0.01% bigger. For comparison, the gif in this readme is 2778093 bytes or 2728,97 times bigger! The Firefox icon is 8532 bytes, 8.38 times bigger!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A generalised solution to distributed consensus</title>
<link>https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/08/a-generalised-solution-to-distributed-consensus/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/08/a-generalised-solution-to-distributed-consensus/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06776&quot;&gt;A generalised solution to distributed consensus&lt;/a&gt; Howard &amp;amp; Mortier, &lt;em&gt;arXiv’19&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a draft paper that Heidi Howard recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1098167557792718849?s=21&quot;&gt;shared with the world via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hh360.user.srcf.net/blog/2019/02/towards-an-intuitive-high-performance-consensus-algorithm/&quot;&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;. It caught my eye for promising a generalised solution to the consensus problem, and also for using reasoning over immutable state to get there. The state maintained at each server is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/06/keeping-calm-when-distributed-consistency-is-easy/&quot;&gt;monotonic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consensus is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/03/01/cant-we-all-just-agree/&quot;&gt;notoriously hard problem&lt;/a&gt;, and Howard has been deep in the space for several years now. See for example the 2016 paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/27/flexible-paxos-quorum-intersection-revisited/&quot;&gt;Flexible Paxos&lt;/a&gt;. The quest for the holy grail here is to find a unifying and easily understandable protocol that can be instantiated in different configurations allowing different trade-offs to be made according to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper re-examines the problem of distributed consensus with the aim of improving performance and understanding. We proceed as follows. Once we have defined the problem of consensus, we propose a generalised solution to consensus that uses only immutable state to enable more intuitive reasoning about correctness. We subsequently prove that both Paxos and Fast Paxos are instances of our generalised consensus algorithm and thus show that both algorithms are conservative in their approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The distributed consensus problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a set of servers (at least two) that need to agree upon a value. Clients take as input a value to be written, and produce as output the value agreed by the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The output value must have been the input value of a client (ruling out simple solutions that always output a fixed value for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All clients that produce an output must output the same value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All clients must eventually produce an output if the system is reliable and synchronous for a sufficient period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we’re talking here about the ‘inner game’ – this is just to agree upon a single value, whereas in a real deployment we’ll probably run multiple rounds of the protocol to agree upon a series of values. Moreover, we’re assuming here that the set of clients and servers is fixed and known to the clients. The ‘clients’ are probably not end-user clients, but more likely to be system processes making using of a consensus service. Configuration changes and membership epochs is another layer we’ll probably add-on in real deployments, but is also out of scope here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building blocks: immutable registers and quorums&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a fixed set of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; servers, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_0%2C+S_1%2C+...%2C+S_n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_0, S_1, ..., S_n&quot; title=&quot;S_0, S_1, ..., S_n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;. Each server has a tape it can write to, aka, an infinite array of &lt;strong&gt;write-once&lt;/strong&gt; persistent registers, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_0%2C+R_1%2C+...&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;R_0, R_1, ...&quot; title=&quot;R_0, R_1, ...&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the tape is blank – all registers are &lt;em&gt;unwritten&lt;/em&gt;. Once we write a value in a register slot it can never be changed. In addition to values provided by clients the system has one special value, denoted &lt;em&gt;nil&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbot&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\bot&quot; title=&quot;\bot&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be interested in sets of values from the same register slot across all servers. A &lt;em&gt;register set&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; title=&quot;i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is the set of all registers &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;R_i&quot; title=&quot;R_i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; across all servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If enough of the registers in a register set have the same (non- &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbot&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\bot&quot; title=&quot;\bot&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;) value, then we will say that the servers have &lt;em&gt;decided&lt;/em&gt; upon that value. How many registers in a register set is &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; though? That’s something we get to decide as part of the configuration of the protocol. In fact, we specify more than just the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of register values that must be in agreement, we also specify which servers they belong to. A (non-empty) subset of servers that can decide a value between them is called a &lt;em&gt;quorum&lt;/em&gt;. More precisely, “&lt;em&gt;a quorum, Q, is a (non-empty) subset of servers, such that if all servers have the same (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; in the same register then &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is said to be decided.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word ‘quorum’ is often strongly associated with ‘majority,’ but note that this doesn’t have to be the case. The specification allows us to declare a quorum containing just a single server if we want to. The dictionary definition of quorum is “the minimum number of members of an assembly or society that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid.” Note that there is also no requirement here for overlapping quorum memberships (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each register set is associated with a set of quorums. That is, on a register-set by register-set basis, we can specify exactly which subsets of servers are allowed to decide a value. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-1.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why on earth we would want to have different quorum sets for different register sets— since we’re only agreeing on a single value at the end of the day!— will become more apparent when we look at how to layer a consensus protocol on top of the registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given quorum configurations and register values for register sets, we can see if any quorum is satisfied and a decision reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of all registers can be represented in a table, known as a &lt;em&gt;state table&lt;/em&gt;, where each column represents the state of one server and each row represents a register set. By combining a configuration with a state table, we can determine whether any decision(s) have been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-2.jpeg?w=520&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we have to be a little careful here and remember that the state table is a logical construct. Each server knows the values of its own registers, and clients can maintain their own view of the global state table as they receive information from servers. Given the immutable constructs though, we know that once a client has assembled enough information to call a value decided, it is finally decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Four rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some rules that need to be followed for this to work as a consensus system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quorum agreement&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only output a (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; if it has read &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; from a quorum of servers in the same register set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New value&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only write a (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; provided that &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is the client’s input value or that the client has read &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; from a register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current decision&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only write a (non-nil) value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; to register &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; on server &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;s&quot; title=&quot;s&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; provided that if &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; is decided in register set &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; by a quorum &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q+%5Cin+Q_r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;Q \in Q_r&quot; title=&quot;Q \in Q_r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; where &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s+%5Cin+Q&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;s \in Q&quot; title=&quot;s \in Q&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; then no value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v'&quot; title=&quot;v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; where &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cneq+v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; title=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; can also be decided in register set &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. A client may only write a (non-nil) value to register &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r&quot; title=&quot;r&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; provided no value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v'&quot; title=&quot;v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; where &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cneq+v%27&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; title=&quot;v \neq v'&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; can be decided by the quorums in registers sets 0 to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+-+1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;r - 1&quot; title=&quot;r - 1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two rules are pretty straightforward. Rule 3 ensures that all decisions made by a register set will be for the same value, while rule 4 ensures that all decisions made by different register sets are for the same value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeying these rules places some further constraints on the system configuration. Say we have two quorums for register set &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BS_0%5C%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\{S_0\}&quot; title=&quot;\{S_0\}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BS_1%5C%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\{S_1\}&quot; title=&quot;\{S_1\}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;. A client writing to the register on &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_0&quot; title=&quot;S_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; has no way of knowing whether or not some other client might be writing a different value to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;S_1&quot; title=&quot;S_1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;, hence we couldn’t uphold rule 3. There are three ways we can handle this situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trivial solution is to allow only one quorum per register set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With multiple quorums, we can require that all quorums for a register set intersect (i.e., any two quorums will have at least one overlapping member)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can use &lt;em&gt;client restricted configurations&lt;/em&gt;. Here ownership of a given register set is assigned to a given client, such that only that client can write values in that register set. Assuming the client is consistent with the values it writes, all will be well. One such strategy would be a round-robin ownership of register sets:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-4.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To comply with rule 4, clients need to consult their emerging view of the global state table, aka their &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; state table, and figure out whether any decision has been or could be reached by earlier register sets. The client maintains a decision table with one entry for each quorum of each register set. This table tracks what the client knows about the decisions made by the quorum. Possible values for a quorum are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ANY – any value could yet be decided. (All quorums for all register sets start out in this state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAYBE &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; – if this quorum reaches a decision, then the value will be &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DECIDED &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; – the value &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;v&quot; title=&quot;v&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot; /&gt; has been decided by the quorum (a final state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NONE – the quorum will not decide a value; a final state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the client receives information from servers, it updates the decision table according to the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients use the decision table to implement the four rules for correctness as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-5.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to make reasoning about correctness sufficiently intuitive that proofs are not necessary to make a convincing case for the safety…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be pleased to know however that proofs &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; included, and you’ll find them in Appendix A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Paxos over immutable registers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a paper summary, I guess this write-up so far has been a spectacular fail! I’m already over my target length, and have probably taken more words to explain the core ideas than the original paper does!! The only defence I can offer is that there are no short-cuts when it comes to thinking about consensus 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of the paper is to show that the register-based scheme just outlined can be instantiated to realise a number of consensus schemes from the literature, including Paxos and Fast Paxos. I’m out of space to do that proper justice, but here’s a sneak-peek at the core Paxos algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that Paxos is a conservative instance of our generalised solution to consensus. The configuration used by Paxos is majorities for all register sets.. Paxos also uses client restricted for all register sets. The purpose of phase one is to implement rule 4, and the purpose of phase two is to implement rule 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/generalised-consensus-fig-8.jpeg?w=640&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you differentiate between the quorums used for each register set and which phase of Paxos the quorum is used for, you can arrive at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/27/flexible-paxos-quorum-intersection-revisited/&quot;&gt;Flexible Paxos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mixing it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 5 of the paper shows how to derive Fast Paxos, and in section six you’ll find a brief sketch of three other points in the configuration space named co-located consensus, fixed-majority consensus, and reconfigurable consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we have reframed the problem of distributed consensus in terms of write-once registers and thus proposed a generalised solution to distributed consensus. We have demonstrated that this solution not only uniﬁes existing algorithms including Paxos and Fast Paxos but also demonstrates that such algorithms are conservative as their quorum intersection requirements and quorum agreement rules can be substantially weakened. We have illustrated the power of our generalised consensus algorithm by proposing three novel algorithms for consensus, demonstrating a few interesting points on the diverse array of algorithms made possible by our abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to pass a programming interview (2016)</title>
<link>https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-pass-a-programming-interview</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-pass-a-programming-interview</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post started as the preparation material we send to our candidates, but we decided to post it publicly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a good programmer has a surprisingly small role in passing programming interviews. To be a productive programmer, you need to be able to solve large, sprawling problems over weeks and months. Each question in an interview, in contrast, lasts less than one hour. To do well in an interview, then, you need to be able to solve small problems quickly, under duress, while explaining your thoughts clearly. This is a different skill &lt;sup id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-pass-a-programming-interview#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. On top of this, interviewers are often poorly trained and inattentive (they would rather be programming), and ask questions far removed from actual work. They bring bias, pattern matching, and a lack of standardization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running Triplebyte, I see this clearly. We interview engineers without looking at resumes, and fast-track them to on-sites at top tech companies. We’ve interviewed over 1000 programmers in the last nine months. We focus heavily on practical programming, and let candidates pick one of several ways to be evaluated. This means we work with many (very talented) programmers without formal CS training. Many of these people do poorly on interviews. They eat large sprawling problems for breakfast, but they balk at 45-min algorithm challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that interviewing is a skill that can be learned. We’ve had success teaching candidates to do better on interviews. Indeed, the quality that most correlates with a Triplebyte candidate passing interviews at companies is not raw talent, but rather diligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I fundamentally do not believe that good programmers should have to learn special interviewing skills to do well on interviews.&lt;/strong&gt; But the status quo is what it is. We’re working at Triplebyte to change this. If you’re interested in what we’re doing, we’d love you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com&quot;&gt;check out our process&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, if you do want to get better at interviewing, this blog post describes how we think you can most effectively do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Be enthusiastic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm has a huge impact on interview results. About 50% of the Triplebyte candidates who fail interviews at companies fail for non-technical reasons. This is usually described by the company as a “poor culture fit”. Nine times out of ten, however, culture fit just means enthusiasm for what a company does. Companies want candidates who are excited about their mission. This carries as much weight at many companies as technical skill. This makes sense. Excited employees will be happier and work harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this can be faked. Some candidates manage to convince every company they talk to that it’s their dream job, while others (who are genuinely excited) fail to convince anyone. We’ve seen this again and again. The solution is for everyone to get better at showing their enthusiasm. This is not permission to lie. But interviewing is like dating. No one wants to be told on a first date that they are one option among many, even though this is usually the case. Similarly, most programmers just want a good job with a good paycheck. But stating this in an interview is a mistake. The best approach is to prepare notes before an interview about what you find exciting about the company, and bring this up with each interviewer when they ask if you have any questions. A good source of ideas is to read the company’s recent blog posts and press releases and note the ones you find exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea seems facile. I imagine you are nodding along as you read this. But (as anyone who has ever interviewed can tell you) a surprisingly small percentage of applicants do this. Carefully preparing notes on why you find a company exciting really will increase your pass rate. You can even reference the notes during the interview. Bringing prepared notes shows preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Study common interview concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large percentage of interview questions feature data structures and algorithms. For better or worse, this is the truth. We gather question details from our candidates who interview at companies (we’ll be doing a in-depth analysis of this data in a future article), and algorithm questions make up over 70% of the questions that are asked. You do not need to be an expert, but knowing the following list of algorithms and data structures will help at most companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hash tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linked lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadth-first search, depth-first search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quicksort, merge sort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2D arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary search trees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big-O analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on your background, this list may look trivial, or may look totally intimidating. That’s exactly the point. These are concepts that are far more common in interviews than they are in production web programming. If you’re self-taught or years out of school and these concepts are not familiar to you, you will do better in interviews if you study them. Even if you do know these things, refreshing your knowledge will help. &lt;strong&gt;A startlingly high percentage of interview questions reduce to breadth-first search or the use of a hash table to count uniques.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to be able to write a BFS cold, and you need to understand how a hash table is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning these things is not as hard as many of the people we talk to fear. Algorithms are usually described in academic language, and this can be off-putting. But at its core, nothing on this list is more complicated than the architecture of a modern web app. If you can build a web app (well), you can learn these things. The resource that I recommend is the book &lt;em&gt;The Algorithm Design Manual&lt;/em&gt; by Steven Skiena. Chapters 3 through 5 do a great job of going over this material, in a straightforward way. It does use C and some math syntax, but it explains the material well. Coursera also has several good algorithms courses. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/course/algo&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, focuses on the concepts that are important in interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying algorithms and data structures helps not only because the material comes up in interviews, but also because the approach to problems taken in an algorithm course is the same approach that works best in interviews. Studying algorithms will get you in an interview mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Get help from your interviewer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewers help candidates. They give hints, they respond to ideas, and they generally guide the process. But they don’t help all candidates equally. &lt;strong&gt;Some programmers are able to extract significant help, without the interviewer holding it against them.&lt;/strong&gt; Others are judged harshly for any hints they are given. You want to be helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes down to process and communication. If the interviewer likes your process and you communicate well with them, they will not mind helping. You can make this more likely by following a careful process. The steps I recommend are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk through a brute-force solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk through an optimized solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you are asked an interview question, start by clarifying what was asked. This is the time to be pedantic. Clarify every ambiguity you can think of. Ask about edge cases. Bring up specific examples of input, and make sure you are correct about the expected output. Ask questions even if you’re almost sure you know the answers. This is useful because it gives you a chance to come up with edge cases and fully spec the problem (seeing how you handle edge-cases is one of the main things that interviewers look for when evaluating an interview), and also because it gives you a minute to collect your thoughts before you need to start solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you should talk through the simplest brute-force solution to the problem that you can think of. You should talk, rather than jump right into coding, because you can move faster when talking, and it’s more engaging for the interviewer. &lt;strong&gt;If the interviewer is engaged, they will step in and offer pointers. &lt;/strong&gt;If you retreat into writing code, however, you'll miss this opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates often skip the brute-force step, assuming that the brute-force solution to the problem is too obvious, or wrong. This is a mistake. Make sure that you always give a solution to the problem you’ve been asked (even if it takes exponential time, or an NSA super computer). When you’ve described a brute-force solution, ask the interviewer if they would like you to implement it, or come up with more efficient solution. Normally they will tell you to come up with a more efficient solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for the more efficient solution is the same as for the brute force. Again talk, don’t write code, and bounce ideas off of the interviewer. Hopefully, the question will be similar to something you’ve seen, and you’ll know the answer. If that is not the case, it’s useful to think of what problems you’ve seen that are most similar, and bring these up with the interviewer. Most interview questions are slightly-obscured applications of classic CS algorithms. The interviewer will often guide you to this algorithm, but only if you begin the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after both you and your interviewer agree that you have a good solution, you should write your code. Depending on the company, this may be on a computer or a whiteboard. But because you’ve already come up with the solution, this should be fairly straightforward. For extra points, ask your interviewer if they would like you to write tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Talk about trade-offs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming interviews are primarily made up of programming questions, and that is what I have talked about so far. However, you may also encounter system design questions. Companies seem to like these especially for more experienced candidates. In a system design question, the candidate is asked how he or she would design a complex real-world system. Examples include designing Google Maps, designing a social network, or designing an API for a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first observation is that answering system design questions requires some specific knowledge. Obviously no one actually expects you to design Google Maps (that took a lot of people a long time). But they do expect you to have some insight into aspects of such a design. The good news is that these questions usually focus on web backends, so you can make a lot of progress by reading about this area. An incomplete list of things to understand is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HTTP (at the protocol level)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Databases (indexes, query planning)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CDNs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching (LRU cache, memcached, redis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load balancers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed worker systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to understand these concepts. But more importantly, you need to understand how they fit together to form real systems. The best way to learn this is to read about how other engineers have used the concepts. The blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://highscalability.com/&quot;&gt;High Scalability&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource for this. It publishes detailed write-ups of the back-end architecture at real companies. You can read about how every concept on the list above is used in real systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done this reading, answering system design questions is a matter of process. Start at the highest level, and move downward. At each level, ask your interviewer for specifications (should you suggest a simple starting point, or talk about what a mature system might look like?) and talk about several options (applying the ideas from your reading). Discussing tradeoffs in your design is key. Your interviewer cares less about whether your design is good in itself, and more about whether you are able to talk about the trade-offs (positives and negatives) of your decisions. Practice this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Highlight results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third type of question you may encounter is the experience question. This is where the interviewer asks you to talk about a programming project that you completed in the past. The mistake that many engineers make on this question is to talk about a technically interesting side-project. Many programmers choose to talk about implementing a neural network classifier, or writing a Twitter grammar bot. These are bad choices because it’s very hard for the interviewer to judge their scope. Many candidates exaggerate simple side projects (sometimes that never actually worked), and the interviewer has no way to tell if you are doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to choose a project that produced results, and highlight the results. This often involves picking a less technically interesting project, but it’s worth it. Think (ahead of time) of the programming you’ve done that had the largest real-world impact. If you’ve written a iOS game, and 50k people have downloaded it, the download number makes it a good option. If you’ve written an admin interface during an internship that was deployed to the entire admin staff, the deployment makes it a good thing to talk about. Selecting a practical project will also communicate to the company that you focus on actual work. Programmer too focused on interesting tech is an anti-pattern that companies screen against (these programmers are sometimes not productive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Use a dynamic language, but mention C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend that you use a dynamic language like Python, Ruby or JavaScript during interviews. Of course, you should use whatever language you know best. But we find that many people try interviewing in C , C++ or Java, under the impression these are the “real’ programming languages. Several classic books on interviewing recommend that programmers choose Java or C++. At startups at least, we’ve found that this is bad advice. Candidates do better when using dynamic languages. This is true, I think, because of dynamic languages’ compact syntax, flexible typing, and list and hash literals. They are permissive languages. This can be a liability when writing complex systems (a highly debatable point), but it’s great when trying to cram binary search onto a whiteboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what language you use, it’s helpful to mention work in other languages. An anti-pattern that companies screen against is people who only know one language. If you do only know one language, you have to rely on your strength in that language. But if you’ve done work or side-projects in multiple languages, be sure to bring this up when talking to your interviewers. If you have worked in lower-level languages like C, C++, Go, or Rust, talking about this will particularly help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java, C# and PHP are a problematic case. As we described in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog/who-y-combinator-companies-want&quot;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve uncovered bias against these languages in startups. We have data showing that programmers using these languages in the interview pass at a lower rate. This is not fair, but it is the truth. If you have other options, I recommend against using these languages in interviews with startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Practice, practice, practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get much better at interviewing by practicing answering questions. This is true because interviews are stressful, but stress harms performance. The solution is practice. Interviewing becomes less stressful with exposure. This happens naturally with experience. Even within a single job search, we find that candidates often fail their initial interviews, and then pass more as their confidence builds. If stress is something you struggle with, I recommend that you jumpstart this process by &lt;strong&gt;practicing interview stress.&lt;/strong&gt; Get a list of interview questions (the book &lt;em&gt;Cracking the Coding Interview&lt;/em&gt; is one good source) and solve them. Set a 20-minute timer on each question, and race to answer. Practice writing the answers on a whiteboard (not all companies require this, but it’s the worst case, so you should practice it). A pen on paper is a pretty good simulation of a whiteboard. If you have friends who can help you prepare, taking turns interviewing each other is great. Reading a lot of interview questions has the added benefit of providing you ideas to use when in actual interviews. A surprising number of questions are re-used (in full or in part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even experienced (and stress-free) candidates will benefit from this. Interviewing is a fundamentally different skill from working as a programmer, and it can atrophy. But experienced programers often (reasonably) feel that they should not have to prepare for interviews. They study less. This is why junior candidates often actually do better on interview questions than experienced candidates. Companies know this, and, paradoxically, some tell us they set lower bars on the programming questions for experienced candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Mention credentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credentials bias interviewers. Triplebyte candidates who have worked at a top company or studied at a top school go on to pass interviews at a 30% higher rate than programmers who don’t have these credentials (for a given level of performance on our credential-blind screen). I don’t like this. It’s not meritocratic and it sucks, but if you have these credentials, it’s in your interest to make sure that your interviewers know this. You can’t trust that they’ll read your resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Line up offers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever read fund-raising advice for founders, you’ll know that getting the 1st VC to make an investment offer is the hardest part. Once you have one offer, more come pouring in. The same is true of job offers. If you already have an offer, be sure to mention this in interviews. Mentioning other offers in an interview heavily biases the interviewer in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up the strategy of making a list of the companies you’re interested in, and setting up interviews in &lt;strong&gt;reverse order of interest.&lt;/strong&gt; Doing well earlier in the process will increase your probability of getting an offer from you number one choice. You should do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing interviews is a skill. Being a great programmer helps, but it’s only part of the picture. Everyone fails some of their interviews, and preparing properly can help everyone pass more. Enthusiasm is paramount, and research helps with this. As many programmers fail for lacking enthusiasm as fail for technical reasons. Interviewers help candidates during interviews, and if you follow a good process and communicate clearly, they will help you. Practice always helps. Reading lots of interview questions and inuring yourself to interview stress will lead to more offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation is not ideal. Preparing for interviews is work, and forcing programmers to learn skills other than building great software wastes everyone’s time. Companies should improve their interview processes to be less biased by academic CS, memorized facts, and rehearsed interview processes. This is what we’re doing at Triplebyte. We help programmers get jobs without looking at resumes. We let programmers pick one of several areas in which to be evaluated, and we study and improve our process over time. We’d love to help you get a job at a startup, without jumping through these hoops. You can get started &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But the status quo is what it is. Until this changes, programmers should know how to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Jared Friedman, Emmett Shear, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian and Daniel Gackle for reading drafts of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; This is not to say that interview performance does not correlate with programing skill. It does. But the correlation is far weaker than most companies assume, and factors other than programing skill explain a large part of interview variance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-to-pass-a-programming-interview#ref1&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>How to pass a programming interview</og:title>
<og:description>Being a good programmer has a surprisingly small role in passing programming interviews. To be a productive programmer, you need to be able to solve large, sprawling problems over weeks and months. Each question in an interview, in contrast, lasts less than one hour. To do well in an interview, then, you need to be able to solve small problems quickly, under duress, while explaining your thoughts clearly. This is a different skill. On top of this, interviewers are often poorly trained and inattentive (they would rather be programming), and ask questions far removed from actual work. They bring bias, pattern matching, and a lack of standardization.</og:description>

<title>SpaceX Crew Dragon Splashes Down After Historic Test Flight</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mission of SpaceX’s new astronaut taxi is in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Crew Dragon capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast today (March 8) at 8:45 a.m. EST (1345 GMT), wrapping up a &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;1&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-demo-1-test-flight-photos.html&quot;&gt;historic mission to the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no astronauts aboard this flight, &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;2&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-dummy-called-ripley.html&quot;&gt;only the sensor-packed dummy Ripley&lt;/a&gt; named after a character from the “Alien” films. But the success of the test flight, known as Demo-1, helps paves the way for a crewed mission of the SpaceX vehicle, perhaps as early as this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be a huge milestone when it comes; astronauts haven’t launched to orbit from American soil since NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fifty years after humans landed on the moon for the first time, America has driven a golden spike on the trail to new space exploration feats through the work of our commercial partner&lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;6&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/18853-spacex.html&quot;&gt; SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; and all of the dedicated and talented flight controllers at NASA and our international partners,” NASA astronaut Anne McClain radioed Mission Control from the ISS when Crew Dragon undocked from the orbiting lab earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a new era in human spaceflight,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said Wednesday (March 6) during a webcast event with Vice President Mike Pence, who spoke to McClain and Canadian Space Agency’s David Saint-Jacques from NASA’s Mission Control center in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA officials said there was a bit of Apollo history involved in today’s Crew Dragon splashdown: It came  nearly 50 years to the day after the Apollo 9 spacecraft returned to Earth in the same area on March 13, 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A pioneering flight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA is currently dependent on Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft to ferry its astronauts to and from the ISS. And this service isn’t cheap; each seat on the three-person Soyuz currently sells for about $80 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in 2014, NASA signed commercial-crew contracts with SpaceX and Boeing—worth $2.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively—to foster the development of homegrown American spaceships. Like SpaceX, Boeing is building a capsule, called &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;8&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/19367-boeing-cst-100.html&quot;&gt;CST-100 Starliner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when the contracts were signed, NASA officials said they hoped these private spaceships would be up and running by the end of 2017. That didn’t happen, of course. But both companies are now getting pretty close, as Demo-1 shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission began Saturday morning (March 2) with a &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;9&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-crew-dragon-test-flight.html&quot;&gt;liftoff atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket&lt;/a&gt; from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Crew Dragon carried Ripley and about 450 lbs. (200 kilograms) of supplies for the ISS crew. Also aboard was the adorable “Little Earth” Celestial Buddies plush toy as a “zero-g” indicator. That toy will remain aboard the station—it will be retrieved by SpaceX’s first astroanut crew later this year—but Crew Dragon did return about 330 lbs. (150 kg) of experiment results and other gear to Earth on this flight, NASA officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of Demo-1 was to test the capsule’s many systems in flight, to make sure Crew Dragon is ready to carry astronauts. And the private spacecraft seems to have hit all its marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crew Dragon docked autonomously at the ISS Sunday morning (March 3) and then stayed attached to the orbiting lab for five days. The capsule departed at 2:32 a.m. EST (0732 GMT) today, survived the fiery descent through Earth’s atmosphere, deployed its parachutes and splashed down gently into the Atlantic’s rolling waves, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) off the Florida coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this was routine. Crew Dragon is based on SpaceX’s &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;10&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/12033-spacex-dragon-space-capsule-infographic.html&quot;&gt;robotic Dragon freighter&lt;/a&gt;, which has been flying resupply missions to the ISS under a separate NASA contract since 2012. But the two capsules are very different, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dragon 2, or Crew Dragon, is a fundamental redesign,” Musk said during a postlaunch news conference Saturday. There’s “hardly a part in common with Dragon 1,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Crew Dragon has seats, windows, a life-support system, touch-screen controls, emergency-escape thrusters and other astronaut-related accoutrements that the cargo version lacks. Crew Dragon also docks directly with the ISS, whereas its older cousin must be grappled by the orbiting lab’s huge robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the crew-carrying capsule has a different parachute system and back-shell shape, neither of which had shown its mettle during an orbital mission. So, a successful return to Earth today was &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;11&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-earth-return-challenging.html&quot;&gt;far from guaranteed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I see hypersonic re-entry as probably my greatest concern,” Musk said during Saturday’s news conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crewed flight coming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coming months will be packed with big milestones for both SpaceX and Boeing, if all goes according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next for SpaceX is a test of Crew Dragon’s emergency-escape system, which is designed to get the capsule to safety if a serious problem were to occur during launch. This uncrewed flight, which is currently &lt;a data-component=&quot;Inline links&quot; data-count=&quot;24&quot; data-index=&quot;12&quot; data-track-type=&quot;click&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2019/02/06/nasa-partners-update-commercial-crew-launch-dates/&quot;&gt;targeted for June&lt;/a&gt;, will employ the same capsule that just came back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that—possibly as early as July—will come Demo-2, Crew Dragon’s astronaut-carrying debut. This landmark test flight will tote NASA’s Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to and from the ISS. Operational, contracted missions, each of which will ferry four astronauts, will commence sometime thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Starliner’s first uncrewed test mission to the ISS could launch as soon as next month. The Boeing capsule’s emergency-escape test and first crewed demonstration flight to the orbiting lab will occur no earlier than May and August, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It won’t be long before our astronaut colleagues are aboard Crew Dragon and Boeing Starliner vehicles,” McClain said. “And we can’t wait.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Updates from YC</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/updates-from-yc/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/updates-from-yc/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We have a few updates about YC to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam is transitioning to Chairman of YC and has shifted his operational responsibilities at YC to other partners. This change will allow Sam to spend more time focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/&quot;&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; while still being responsible, along with the rest of the partnership, for the long-term social and economic success of YC. Because YC is run as a partnership, there will be no significant operational change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are going well — in the past two years, we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupschool.org/&quot;&gt;Startup School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/introducing-yc-series-a-batches/&quot;&gt;the Series A program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-stage-program/&quot;&gt;the YC Growth program&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workatastartup.com/&quot;&gt;Work at a Startup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-china-qi-lu/&quot;&gt;YC China&lt;/a&gt;. The current total market capitalization of YC companies is around $150 billion. The YC network now has over 4,000 alumni and 1,900 companies, and it has become a reliable source of advice, customers, friendship, and support for YC founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had over 12,000 applicants for the Winter 2019 batch. This was a 30% increase compared to the Summer 2018 batch. We had two choices—either we reject a lot of great founders, or we figure out how to grow the batch. We decided to grow. We funded over 200 companies this batch, an increase of 25% compared to S18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That necessitated some changes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ycombinator.com/demoday/faq/&quot;&gt;Demo Day&lt;/a&gt;. We will now have two stages running in parallel over two days, allowing more time for investors to interact with founders off-stage. With a larger space, we’ve been able to invite many more investors so that investment firms can send more people. (For those investors who want to watch every pitch, we record the presentations and make them available to watch on our Demo Day website.) Because of these changes, we had to move to a new venue. We had been talking for some time about moving to San Francisco, and this seemed like the natural time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of San Francisco, we are considering moving YC to the city and are currently looking for space. The center of gravity for new startups has clearly shifted over the past five years, and although we love our space in Mountain View, we are rethinking whether the logistical tradeoff is worth it, especially given how difficult the commute has become. We also want to be closer to our Bay Area alumni, who disproportionately live and work in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we’ve gotten better at serving and being more accessible to founders who live around the world. Startup School is our free online program to teach people how to start a startup and to provide advice and community. Last year we had 10,500 companies participate. We’re particularly proud that 30% of the companies in this current batch came from Startup School! Our mission with this program is to bring the cost of knowledge, community, and tools to start a startup way down. Going forward, everyone who wants to do Startup School will be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we continue to scale up our Series A program, which helps our companies raise an A round when they’re ready. In the last twelve months, there were 96 Series As across the YC portfolio, and the Series A program helped 67 of those companies raise their rounds. We also started running Series A batches, modeled after the classic YC batches, and have created an investor portal to help more investors to get access to YC Series As.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Animals are no less emotional than we are</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/sunday/emotions-animals-humans.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/sunday/emotions-animals-humans.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Uniquely human emotions don’t exist. More and more, I believe that we share all emotions with other species in the same way that we share virtually every organ in our bodies with them. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Like organs, the emotions evolved over millions of years to serve essential functions. Their usefulness has been tested again and again, giving them the wisdom of ages. They nudge us to do what is best for us. Some emotions may be more developed in humans, or apply to a wider range of circumstances, but none is fundamentally new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is not the prevailing view in science, though. The most popular theory proposes only six “primary” or “basic” emotions, which are universally recognized by their facial expressions, like anger (frowning stare), happiness (laugh and smile), and fear (eyes wide open, lips stretched horizontally). All other emotions are “secondary,” which means that they are cultural constructs that make us human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But does anyone truly believe that just because an emotion lacks a specific face, we can claim it for ourselves? Open your front door and tell your dog that you are going out for a walk, then close the door and return to your seat. Your dog, who had been barking and wriggling with excitement, now slinks back to his basket and puts his head down on his paws. You have just witnessed both hope and disappointment in another species, even though neither counts as a basic emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;You may say that it is impossible to know what a dog feels. True, yet his behavior clearly reflects an abrupt change in his emotional state. Expressed in the body, these states are perfectly observable and measurable even if the associated private experiences are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In fact, the possibility of animal hope was experimented upon nearly a century ago by the psychologist Otto Tinklepaugh. He first let a monkey watch a banana being hidden under a cup, then allowed her into the room where this had been done. If she found the banana, everything proceeded smoothly. But if the experimenter had surreptitiously replaced the banana with a piece of lettuce, the monkey would frantically look around, lifting up the cup, while shrieking at the experimenter. Her expectations had been violated, for which she rightly blamed the sneaky experimenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;We share so many so-called secondary emotions with other species that the whole concept is questionable. There is one exception, though, which keeps being proposed as definitely cultural: guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This is despite the many dog owners who seem to recognize it in their pets when they hide under the table after a transgression. One expert in animal cognition at Barnard, Alexandra Horowitz, tested this out by having dogs meet an angry owner both when they had not broken any rules and when they had; she also had them meet a relaxed owner in the same two situations. Dr. Horowitz concluded that whether dogs take on a guilty look — lowered gaze, ears pressed back, tail rapidly beating between the legs — is unrelated to whether or not they followed orders. If the owner scolds them, they look extremely guilty. If the owner doesn’t, they still sometimes look like this, but less often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;One problem, however, is that our rules are of our own making, such as “Don’t jump on that couch!” or “Keep your nails off my leather chair!” It must be as tough for our pets to grasp these prohibitions as it was for me to understand why I couldn’t chew gum in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;It would be better to test behavior that is wrong by almost any standard, including that of their own species. The Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz gave one of my favorite examples, about his dog, Bully, who broke the fundamental rule never to bite your superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Humans don’t need to teach this rule, and indeed Bully had never been punished for it. The dog bit his master’s hand when Dr. Lorenz tried to break up a dogfight. Even though Dr. Lorenz petted him right away, Bully suffered a complete nervous breakdown. For days, he was virtually paralyzed and ignored his food. He would lie on the rug breathing shallowly, occasionally interrupted by a deep sigh. He had violated a natural taboo, which among ancestral canines could have had the worst imaginable consequences, such as expulsion from the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Among the primates, the most suggestive cases of remorse concern bonobos. These apes are as close to us as chimpanzees, but far more peaceful and gentle, which means that they almost never hurt one another. Whereas in most primates reconciliation after a fight is typically sought by the subordinate party, in bonobos it is the dominant animal that seeks to make amends, especially if he has inflicted an injury. He may return to his victim and unerringly reach for the exact same toe that he has bitten and carefully inspect the damage. He obviously knows precisely what he has done and where. Then he spends half an hour or more licking and cleaning the wound that he himself inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Another human emotion that has been elevated to a special status is disgust. In his book “Human: The Science Behind What Makes Us Unique,” the neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga views disgust as one of the five emotional modules that set us apart from all other animals. Here, too, dogs are a prime example, given that they eat feces and lick their testicles. This is taken as proof that dogs must lack disgust. But give your dog a cut lemon (not recommended) and you will see a full-blown yuck! response with curled-up lips, drooling and withdrawal from the sour smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Disgust is an incredibly adaptive response. Every organism needs to avoid parasites and prevent the ingestion of harmful foods (citrus fruits can be poisonous to canines). Ignoring this mundane origin, however, psychologists have fallen in love with the moral connotations of this emotion. We are disgusted, for example, by someone who fakes a racist attack on himself to gain positive media attention. We “turn up our noses” at such people, showing our typical disgust face with wrinkled nose and narrowed eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But even if moral disgust is special, it is no accident that our facial expression also blocks wafts of foul air from getting into our eyes and nostrils. This hints at the emotion’s origin. Chimpanzees show the same expression when it rains, something they hate. As soon as a downpour starts, young and old pull an ugly face known as the “rain face,” in which they bring their upper lip close to their nose and stick out their lower lip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Having grown up in the Netherlands, I know this expression firsthand from watching the throngs of cyclists in Dutch cities. Whenever it pours, they show rain faces inside their plastic ponchos, evidence of their dismay over the prospect of wet clothes for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Disgust is in fact so predictable in apes that an adolescent chimp I saw regularly at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, in Georgia, turned it into a game. The chimp, Tara, would occasionally find a dead rat in the outdoor enclosure and carry it around by its tail, careful to keep it away from her own body, then stealthily lay it on the back or head of a sleeping group mate. Her victim would startle as soon as she felt (or smelled) the dead animal, loudly screaming and wildly shaking her body to get this foul thing off her. She might even rub the spot on her body with a fistful of grass, to make sure the smell was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Tara, for her part, would simply pick up the rat and move on to her next target. Apart from the question of why she considered this game fun, and why we humans immediately see its humor value, it would obviously never have worked in a species that lacked disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But that is not all. We also have experimental studies, such as those by the primatologists Cécile Sarabian and Andrew MacIntosh at Kyoto University, who explore the yuck! factor in wild macaques on a Japanese beach. They place small food items, like grains or peanuts, on top of a variety of objects. Some of these objects are piles of plastic made to look like feces; some are actual piles of fresh feces. Most of the monkeys are disgusted enough by the latter to forgo the food. And if they do pick up food from the feces, they frantically rub their hands afterward. Tested in the same way, bonobos refuse to touch banana slices contaminated by feces. Given how much apes love bananas, this attests to their deep revulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For the longest time, science has depicted animals as stimulus-response machines while declaring their inner lives barren. This has helped us sustain our customary “anthropodenial”: the denial that we are animals. We like to see ourselves as special, but whatever the difference between humans and animals may be, it is unlikely to be found in the emotional domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
