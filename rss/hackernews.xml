<title>Learning KVM – implement your own kernel</title>
<link>https://david942j.blogspot.com/2018/10/note-learning-kvm-implement-your-own.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://david942j.blogspot.com/2018/10/note-learning-kvm-implement-your-own.html</guid>
<description>Few weeks ago I solved a great KVM escaping challenge from TWCTF hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TokyoWesterns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@TokyoWesterns&lt;/a&gt;. I have given a writeup on my blog: &lt;a href=&quot;https://david942j.blogspot.com/2018/09/write-up-tokyowesterns-ctf-2018.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Write-up] TokyoWesterns CTF 2018 - pwn240+300+300 EscapeMe&lt;/a&gt;, but it mentions nothing about KVM because there's no bug (at least I didn't find) around it.&lt;p&gt;Most introduction of KVM I found are actually introducing either libvirt or qemu, lack of how to utilize KVM by hand, that's why I have this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/658511/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; is a good start to implement a simple KVM program. Some projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dpw/kvm-hello-world&quot;&gt;kvm-hello-world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kvmtool/kvmtoo&quot;&gt;kvmtool&lt;/a&gt; are worthy to take a look as well. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page&quot;&gt;OSDev.org&lt;/a&gt; has great resources to learn system architecture knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post I will introduce how to use KVM directly and how it works, wish this article can be a quick start for beginners learning KVM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've created a public repository for the source code of KVM-based hypervisor and the kernel: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/david942j/kvm-kernel-example&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;david942j/kvm-kernel-example&lt;/a&gt;. You can clone and try it after reading this article.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning&lt;/em&gt;: all code in this post may be simplified to clearly show its function, if you want to write some code, I highly recommend you read examples in the repository instead of copy-paste code from here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kernel I implemented is able to execute an ELF in user-space, this is the screenshot of execution result:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--7vsSQoMFw8/W7OZ3zPoETI/AAAAAAAAApI/M9JC3Fgbxb864DKaxb2hcKqTw1wUOkFMwCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/%25E8%259E%25A2%25E5%25B9%2595%25E5%25BF%25AB%25E7%2585%25A7%2B2018-10-03%2B00.15.07.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--7vsSQoMFw8/W7OZ3zPoETI/AAAAAAAAApI/M9JC3Fgbxb864DKaxb2hcKqTw1wUOkFMwCK4BGAYYCw/s640/%25E8%259E%25A2%25E5%25B9%2595%25E5%25BF%25AB%25E7%2585%25A7%2B2018-10-03%2B00.15.07.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KVM (Kernel-base Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that implemented native in Linux kernel. As you know, VM usually used for creating a separated and independent environment. As the official site described, each virtual machine created by KVM has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First I'll introduce how to use KVM to execute simple assembled code, and then describe some key points to implement a Linux kernel. The Linux kernel we will implement is extremely simple, but more features might be added after this post released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All communication with KVM is done by the &lt;span&gt;ioctl&lt;/span&gt; syscall, which is usually used for getting and setting device status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a KVM-based VM basically needs 7 steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open the KVM device, &lt;span&gt;kvmfd=open(&quot;/dev/kvm&quot;, O_RDWR|O_CLOEXEC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do create a VM,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;vmfd=ioctl(kvmfd, KVM_CREATE_VM, 0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up memory for VM guest, &lt;span&gt;ioctl(vmfd, KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION, &amp;amp;region)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Create a virtual CPU for the VM, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;vcpufd=ioctl(vmfd, KVM_CREATE_VCPU, 0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up memory for the vCPU
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;vcpu_size=ioctl(kvmfd, KVM_GET_VCPU_MMAP_SIZE, NULL)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;run=(struct kvm_run*)mmap(NULL, mmap_size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, vcpufd, 0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put assembled code on user memory region, set up vCPU's registers such as &lt;span&gt;rip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run and handle exit reason. &lt;span&gt;while(1) { ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_RUN, 0); ... }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Too complicated!? See this figure&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JAMnkb_Wrf4/W5EfEu4By_I/AAAAAAAAAoY/GLwczGKZgmE9T57Y390gLjPhkr_Sf11BQCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/kvm.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;308&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JAMnkb_Wrf4/W5EfEu4By_I/AAAAAAAAAoY/GLwczGKZgmE9T57Y390gLjPhkr_Sf11BQCK4BGAYYCw/s320/kvm.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A VM needs &lt;strong&gt;user memory region&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;virtual CPU(s)&lt;/strong&gt;, so all we need is to create VM, set up user memory region, create vCPU(s) and its working space then execute it!&lt;p&gt;Code is better than plaintext for hackers. &lt;em&gt;Warning&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;code posted here has no error handling&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Step 1 - 3, set up a new VM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/* step 1~3, create VM and set up user memory region */
void kvm(uint8_t code[], size_t code_len) {
  // step 1, open /dev/kvm
  int kvmfd = open(&quot;/dev/kvm&quot;, O_RDWR|O_CLOEXEC);
  if(kvmfd == -1) errx(1, &quot;failed to open /dev/kvm&quot;);

  // step 2, create VM
  int vmfd = ioctl(kvmfd, KVM_CREATE_VM, 0);

  // step 3, set up user memory region
  size_t mem_size = 0x40000000; // size of user memory you want to assign
  void *mem = mmap(0, mem_size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                   MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
  int user_entry = 0x0;
  memcpy((void*)((size_t)mem + user_entry), code, code_len);
  struct kvm_userspace_memory_region region = {
    .slot = 0,
    .flags = 0,
    .guest_phys_addr = 0,
    .memory_size = mem_size,
    .userspace_addr = (size_t)mem
  };
  ioctl(vmfd, KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION, &amp;amp;region);
  /* end of step 3 */
  // not finished ...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
In above code fragment I assign 1GB memory (&lt;span&gt;mem_size&lt;/span&gt;) to the guest, and put assembled code on the first page. Later we will set the instruction pointer to 0x0 (&lt;span&gt;user_entry&lt;/span&gt;), where the guest should start to execute.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4 - 6, set up a new vCPU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/* step 4~6, create and set up vCPU */
void kvm(uint8_t code[], size_t code_len) {
  /* ... step 1~3 omitted */

  // step 4, create vCPU
  int vcpufd = ioctl(vmfd, KVM_CREATE_VCPU, 0);

  // step 5, set up memory for vCPU
  size_t vcpu_mmap_size = ioctl(kvmfd, KVM_GET_VCPU_MMAP_SIZE, NULL);
  struct kvm_run* run = (struct kvm_run*) mmap(0, vcpu_mmap_size,
                                               PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED,
                                               vcpufd, 0);

  // step 6, set up vCPU's registers
  /* standard registers include general-purpose registers and flags */
  struct kvm_regs regs;
  ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_GET_REGS, &amp;amp;regs);
  regs.rip = user_entry;
  regs.rsp = 0x200000; // stack address
  regs.rflags = 0x2; // in x86 the 0x2 bit should always be set
  ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_SET_REGS, &amp;amp;regs); // set registers

  /* special registers include segment registers */
  struct kvm_sregs sregs;
  ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_GET_SREGS, &amp;amp;sregs);
  sregs.cs.base = sregs.cs.selector = 0; // let base of code segment equal to zero
  ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_SET_SREGS, &amp;amp;sregs);
  // not finished ...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we create a vCPU and set up its registers include standard registers and &quot;special&quot; registers. Each &lt;span&gt;kvm_run&lt;/span&gt; structure corresponds to one vCPU, and we will use it to get the CPU status after execution. Notice that we can create multiple vCPUs under one VM, then with multithread we can emulate a VM with multiple CPUs. Note: by default, the vCPU runs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which only executes &lt;strong&gt;16-bit assembled code&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;To run 32 or 64-bit, the page table must be set up&lt;/strong&gt;, which we'll describe later.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7, execute!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/* last step, run it! */
void kvm(uint8_t code[], size_t code_len) {
  /* ... step 1~6 omitted */
  // step 7, execute vm and handle exit reason
  while (1) {
    ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_RUN, NULL);
    switch (run-&amp;gt;exit_reason) {
    case KVM_EXIT_HLT:
      fputs(&quot;KVM_EXIT_HLT&quot;, stderr);
      return 0;
    case KVM_EXIT_IO:
      /* TODO: check port and direction here */
      putchar(*(((char *)run) + run-&amp;gt;io.data_offset));
      break;
    case KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY:
      errx(1, &quot;KVM_EXIT_FAIL_ENTRY: hardware_entry_failure_reason = 0x%llx&quot;,
        run-&amp;gt;fail_entry.hardware_entry_failure_reason);
    case KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR:
      errx(1, &quot;KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR: suberror = 0x%x&quot;,
        run-&amp;gt;internal.suberror);
    case KVM_EXIT_SHUTDOWN:
      errx(1, &quot;KVM_EXIT_SHUTDOWN&quot;);
    default:
      errx(1, &quot;Unhandled reason: %d&quot;, run-&amp;gt;exit_reason);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Typically we only care about the first two cases, &lt;span&gt;KVM_EXIT_HLT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;KVM_EXIT_IO&lt;/span&gt;. With instruction &lt;span&gt;hlt&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span&gt;KVM_EXIT_HLT&lt;/span&gt; is triggered. Instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_139.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_222.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; trigger &lt;span&gt;KVM_EXIT_IO&lt;/span&gt;. And not only for I/O, we can also use this as hypercall, i.e. to &lt;strong&gt;communicate with the host&lt;/strong&gt;. Here we only print one character sent to device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;ioctl(vcpufd, KVM_RUN, NULL)&lt;/span&gt; will run until an exit-like instruction occurred (such as &lt;span&gt;hlt&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;, or an error). You can also enable the single-step mode (not demonstrated here), then it will stop on every instructions.&lt;p&gt;Let's try our first KVM-based VM:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
int main() {
  /*
  .code16
  mov al, 0x61
  mov dx, 0x217
  out dx, al
  mov al, 10
  out dx, al
  hlt
  */
  uint8_t code[] = &quot;\xB0\x61\xBA\x17\x02\xEE\xB0\n\xEE\xF4&quot;;
  kvm(code, sizeof(code));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
And the execution result is:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
$ ./kvm
a
KVM_EXIT_HLT
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;64-bit World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To execute 64-bit assembled code, we need to set vCPU into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_mode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;long mode&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this wiki page&lt;/a&gt; describes how to switch from real mode to long mode, I highly recommend you read it as well. The most complicated part of switching into long mode is to set up the page tables for mapping virtual address into physical address. x86-64 processor uses a memory management feature named &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PAE (Physical Address Extension)&lt;/a&gt;, contains of four kinds of tables: PML4T, PDPT, PDT, and PT. The way these tables work is that each entry in the PML4T points to a PDPT, each entry in a PDPT to a PDT and each entry in a PDT to a PT. Each entry in a PT then points to the physical address.&lt;br/&gt;

The figure above is called 4K paging. There's another paging method named 2M paging, with the PT (page table) removed. In this method the PDT entries point to physical address.&lt;p&gt;The control registers (&lt;span&gt;cr*&lt;/span&gt;) are used for setting paging attributes. For example, &lt;span&gt;cr3&lt;/span&gt; should point to physical address of &lt;span&gt;pml4&lt;/span&gt;. More information about control registers can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_register&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;This code set up the tables, using the &lt;strong&gt;2M paging&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/* Maps: 0 ~ 0x200000 -&amp;gt; 0 ~ 0x200000 */
void setup_page_tables(void *mem, struct kvm_sregs *sregs){
  uint64_t pml4_addr = 0x1000;
  uint64_t *pml4 = (void *)(mem + pml4_addr);

  uint64_t pdpt_addr = 0x2000;
  uint64_t *pdpt = (void *)(mem + pdpt_addr);

  uint64_t pd_addr = 0x3000;
  uint64_t *pd = (void *)(mem + pd_addr);

  pml4[0] = 3 | pdpt_addr; // PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | pdpt_addr
  pdpt[0] = 3 | pd_addr; // PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | pd_addr
  pd[0] = 3 | 0x80; // PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | PDE64_PS

  sregs-&amp;gt;cr3 = pml4_addr;
  sregs-&amp;gt;cr4 = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5; // CR4_PAE;
  sregs-&amp;gt;cr4 |= 0x600; // CR4_OSFXSR | CR4_OSXMMEXCPT; /* enable SSE instruction */
  sregs-&amp;gt;cr0 = 0x80050033; // CR0_PE | CR0_MP | CR0_ET | CR0_NE | CR0_WP | CR0_AM | CR0_PG
  sregs-&amp;gt;efer = 0x500; // EFER_LME | EFER_LMA
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
There're some control bits record in the tables, include if the page is mapped, is writable, and can be accessed in user-mode. e.g. 3 (&lt;span&gt;PDE64_PRESENT|PDE64_RW&lt;/span&gt;) stands for the memory is mapped and writable, and 0x80 (&lt;span&gt;PDE64_PS&lt;/span&gt;) stands for it's 2M paging instead of 4K. As a result, these page tables can map address below 0x200000 to itself (i.e. virtual address equals to physical address).&lt;p&gt;Remaining is setting segment registers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
void setup_segment_registers(struct kvm_sregs *sregs) {
  struct kvm_segment seg = {
    .base = 0,
    .limit = 0xffffffff,
    .selector = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3,
    .present = 1,
    .type = 11, /* execute, read, accessed */
    .dpl = 0, /* privilege level 0 */
    .db = 0,
    .s = 1,
    .l = 1,
    .g = 1,
  };
  sregs-&amp;gt;cs = seg;
  seg.type = 3; /* read/write, accessed */
  seg.selector = 2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3;
  sregs-&amp;gt;ds = sregs-&amp;gt;es = sregs-&amp;gt;fs = sregs-&amp;gt;gs = sregs-&amp;gt;ss = seg;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We only need to modify VM setup in step 6 to support 64-bit instructions, change code from&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
  sregs.cs.base = sregs.cs.selector = 0; // let base of code segment equal to zero
&lt;/pre&gt;
to&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
  setup_page_tables(mem, &amp;amp;sregs);
  setup_segment_registers(&amp;amp;sregs);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Now we can execute 64-bit assembled code.&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
int main() {
  /*
  movabs rax, 0x0a33323144434241
  push 8
  pop rcx
  mov edx, 0x217
OUT:
  out dx, al
  shr rax, 8
  loop OUT
  hlt
  */
  uint8_t code[] = &quot;H\xB8\x41\x42\x43\x44\x31\x32\x33\nj\bY\xBA\x17\x02\x00\x00\xEEH\xC1\xE8\b\xE2\xF9\xF4&quot;;
  kvm(code, sizeof(code));
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
And the execution result is:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
$ ./kvm64
ABCD123
KVM_EXIT_HLT
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The source code of hypervisor can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/david942j/kvm-kernel-example/tree/master/hypervisor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repository/hypervisor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;So far you are already able to run x86-64 assembled code under KVM, so our &lt;strong&gt;introduction to KVM is almost finished&lt;/strong&gt; (except handling hypercalls). In the next section I will describe how to implement a simple kernel, which contains some OS knowledge. If you are interesting in how kernel works, go ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kernel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before implementing a kernel, some questions need to be dealt with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How CPU distinguishes between kernel-mode and user-mode?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could CPU transfer control to kernel when user invokes &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How kernel switches between kernel and user?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kernel-mode v.s. user-mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;An important difference between kernel-mode and user-mode is some instructions can only be executed under kernel-mode, such as &lt;span&gt;hlt&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;wrmsr&lt;/span&gt;. The two modes are distinguish by the &lt;span&gt;dpl&lt;/span&gt; (descriptor privilege level) field in segment register &lt;span&gt;cs&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;dpl=3&lt;/span&gt;  in &lt;span&gt;cs&lt;/span&gt; for user-mode, and zero for kernel-mode (not sure if this &quot;level&quot; equivalent to so-called ring3 and ring0).&lt;br/&gt;In real mode kernel should handle the segment registers carefully, while in x86-64, instructions &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;sysret&lt;/span&gt; will properly set segment registers automatically, so we don't need to maintain segment registers manually.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;And another difference is the permission setting in page tables. In the above example I set all entries as non-user-accessible:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
  pml4[0] = 3 | pdpt_addr; // PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | pdpt_addr
  pdpt[0] = 3 | pd_addr; // PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | pd_addr
  pd[0] = 3 | 0x80; // PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | PDE64_PS
&lt;/pre&gt;
If kernel wants to create virtual memory for user-space, such as handling &lt;span&gt;mmap&lt;/span&gt; syscall from user, the page tables must set the 3rd bit, i.e. have bit (&lt;span&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2&lt;/span&gt;) set, then the page can be accessed in user-space. For example,&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
  pml4[0] = 7 | pdpt_addr; // PDE64_USER | PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | pdpt_addr
  pdpt[0] = 7 | pd_addr; // PDE64_USER | PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | pd_addr
  pd[0] = 7 | 0x80; // PDE64_USER | PDE64_PRESENT | PDE64_RW | PDE64_PS
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This is just an example, we should &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; set user-accessible pages in hypervisor, user-accessible pages should be handled by our kernel.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syscall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a special register can enable &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;sysenter&lt;/span&gt; instruction: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osdev.org/CPU_Registers_x86-64#IA32_EFER&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EFER (Extended Feature Enable Register)&lt;/a&gt;. We have used it for entering long mode before:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
sregs-&amp;gt;efer = 0x500; // EFER_LME | EFER_LMA
&lt;/pre&gt;
LME and LMA stand for Long Mode Enable and Long Mode Active, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;To enable &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt; as well, we should do&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
sregs-&amp;gt;efer |= 0x1; // EFER_SCE
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;We also need to register syscall handler so that CPU knows where to jump when user invokes syscalls. And of course, this registration should be done in kernel instead of hypervisor. Registration of syscall handler can be achieved via setting special registers named &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osdev.org/Model_Specific_Registers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MSR (Model Specific Registers)&lt;/a&gt;. We can get/set MSR in hypervisor through &lt;span&gt;ioctl&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span&gt;vcpufd&lt;/span&gt;, or in kernel using instructions &lt;span&gt;rdmsr&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;wrmsr&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;To register a syscall handler:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
  lea rdi, [rip+syscall_handler]
  call set_handler
syscall_handler:
  // handle syscalls!
set_handler:
  mov eax, edi
  mov rdx, rdi
  shr rdx, 32
  /* input of msr is edx:eax */
  mov ecx, 0xc0000082 /* MSR_LSTAR, Long Syscall TARget */
  wrmsr
  ret
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The magic number 0xc0000082 is the index for MSR, you can find the definitions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.woboq.org/linux/linux/arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h.html#12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Linux source code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;After setup, we can invoke &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt; instruction and the program will jump to the handler we registered. &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt; instruction not only changes &lt;span&gt;rip&lt;/span&gt;, but also sets &lt;span&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt; as return address so that kernel knows where to go back after handling syscall, and sets &lt;span&gt;r11&lt;/span&gt; as rflags. It will change two segment registers &lt;span&gt;cs&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ss&lt;/span&gt; as well, which we will describe in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching between kernel and user&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also need to register the &lt;span&gt;cs&lt;/span&gt;'s selector for both kernel and user, via the register MSR we have used before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/SYSCALL.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/SYSRET.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; describe what does &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;sysret&lt;/span&gt; do in details, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;From the pseudo code of &lt;span&gt;sysret&lt;/span&gt; you can see it sets attributes of &lt;span&gt;cs&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ss&lt;/span&gt; explicitly:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
CS.Selector ← IA32_STAR[63:48]+16;
CS.Selector ← CS.Selector OR 3; /* RPL forced to 3 */
/* Set rest of CS to a fixed value */
CS.Base ← 0; /* Flat segment */
CS.Limit ← FFFFFH; /* With 4-KByte granularity, implies a 4-GByte limit */
CS.Type ← 11; /* Execute/read code, accessed */
CS.S ← 1;
CS.DPL ← 3;
CS.P ← 1;
CS.L ← 1;
CS.G ← 1; /* 4-KByte granularity */
CPL ← 3;
SS.Selector ← (IA32_STAR[63:48]+8) OR 3; /* RPL forced to 3 */
/* Set rest of SS to a fixed value */
SS.Base ← 0; /* Flat segment */
SS.Limit ← FFFFFH; /* With 4-KByte granularity, implies a 4-GByte limit */
SS.Type ← 3; /* Read/write data, accessed */
SS.S ← 1;
SS.DPL ← 3;
SS.P ← 1;
SS.B ← 1; /* 32-bit stack segment*/
SS.G ← 1; /* 4-KByte granularity */
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We have to register the value of &lt;span&gt;cs&lt;/span&gt; for both kernel and user through MSR:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
  xor rax, rax
  mov rdx, 0x00200008
  mov ecx, 0xc0000081 /* MSR_STAR */
  wrmsr
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The last is set flags mask:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
  mov eax, 0x3f7fd5
  xor rdx, rdx
  mov ecx, 0xc0000084 /* MSR_SYSCALL_MASK */
  wrmsr
&lt;/pre&gt;
The mask is important, when &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt; instruction is invoked, CPU will do:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
rcx = rip;
r11 = rflags;
rflags &amp;amp;= ~SYSCALL_MASK;
&lt;/pre&gt;
If the mask is not set properly, kernel will inherit the &lt;span&gt;rflags&lt;/span&gt; set in user mode, which can cause severely security issues.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The full code of registration is:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
register_syscall:
  xor rax, rax
  mov rdx, 0x00200008
  mov ecx, 0xc0000081 /* MSR_STAR */
  wrmsr

  mov eax, 0x3f7fd5
  xor rdx, rdx
  mov ecx, 0xc0000084 /* MSR_SYSCALL_MASK */
  wrmsr

  lea rdi, [rip + syscall_handler]
  mov eax, edi
  mov rdx, rdi
  shr rdx, 32
  mov ecx, 0xc0000082 /* MSR_LSTAR */
  wrmsr
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Then we can safely use the &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt; instruction in user-mode. Now let's implement the &lt;span&gt;syscall_handler&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
.globl syscall_handler, kernel_stack
.extern do_handle_syscall
.intel_syntax noprefix

kernel_stack: .quad 0 /* initialize it before the first time switching into user-mode */
user_stack: .quad 0

syscall_handler:
  mov [rip + user_stack], rsp
  mov rsp, [rip + kernel_stack]
  /* save non-callee-saved registers */
  push rdi
  push rsi
  push rdx
  push rcx
  push r8
  push r9
  push r10
  push r11

  /* the forth argument */
  mov rcx, r10
  call do_handle_syscall

  pop r11
  pop r10
  pop r9
  pop r8
  pop rcx
  pop rdx
  pop rsi
  pop rdi

  mov rsp, [rip + user_stack]
  .byte 0x48 /* REX.W prefix, to indicate sysret is a 64-bit instruction */
  sysret
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice that we have to properly push-and-pop not callee-saved registers. The &lt;span&gt;syscall&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;sysret&lt;/span&gt; will not modify the stack pointer &lt;span&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;, so we have to handle it manually.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypercall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes our kernel needs to communicate with the hypervisor, this can be done in many ways, in my kernel I use the &lt;span&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; instructions for hypercalls. We have used the &lt;span&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; instruction to simply print a byte to stdout, now we extend it to do more fun things.&lt;br/&gt;An &lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; instruction contains two arguments, 16-bit &lt;span&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt; and 32-bit &lt;span&gt;eax&lt;/span&gt;. I use the value of &lt;span&gt;dx&lt;/span&gt; for indicating what kind of hypercalls is intended to call, and &lt;span&gt;eax&lt;/span&gt; as its argument. I defined these hypercalls:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
#define HP_NR_MARK 0x8000

#define NR_HP_open  (HP_NR_MARK | 0)
#define NR_HP_read  (HP_NR_MARK | 1)
#define NR_HP_write  (HP_NR_MARK | 2)
#define NR_HP_close  (HP_NR_MARK | 3)
#define NR_HP_lseek  (HP_NR_MARK | 4)
#define NR_HP_exit  (HP_NR_MARK | 5)

#define NR_HP_panic (HP_NR_MARK | 0x7fff)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Then modify the hypervisor to not only print bytes when encountering &lt;span&gt;KVM_EXIT_IO&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
while (1) {
  ioctl(vm-&amp;gt;vcpufd, KVM_RUN, NULL);
  switch (vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;exit_reason) {
  /* other cases omitted */
  case KVM_EXIT_IO:
    // putchar(*(((char *)vm-&amp;gt;run) + vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;io.data_offset));
    if(vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;io.port &amp;amp; HP_NR_MARK) {
      switch(vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;io.port) {
      case NR_HP_open: hp_handle_open(vm); break;
      /* other cases omitted */
      default: errx(1, &quot;Invalid hypercall&quot;);
    }
    else errx(1, &quot;Unhandled I/O port: 0x%x&quot;, vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;io.port);
    break;
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Take &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; as example, I implemented the handler of &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; hypercall in hypervisor as: (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;warning&lt;/em&gt;: this code lacks security checks&lt;/strong&gt;):&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/* hypervisor/hypercall.c */
static void hp_handle_open(VM *vm) {
  static int ret = 0;
  if(vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;io.direction == KVM_EXIT_IO_OUT) { // out instruction
    uint32_t offset = *(uint32_t*)((uint8_t*)vm-&amp;gt;run + vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;io.data_offset);
    const char *filename = (char*) vm-&amp;gt;mem + offset;

    MAY_INIT_FD_MAP(); // initialize fd_map if it's not initialized
    int min_fd;
    for(min_fd = 0; min_fd &amp;lt;= MAX_FD; min_fd++)
      if(fd_map[min_fd].opening == 0) break;
    if(min_fd &amp;gt; MAX_FD) ret = -ENFILE;
    else {
      int fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY, 0);
      if(fd &amp;lt; 0) ret = -errno;
      else {
        fd_map[min_fd].real_fd = fd;
        fd_map[min_fd].opening = 1;
        ret = min_fd;
      }
    }
  } else { // in instruction
    *(uint32_t*)((uint8_t*)vm-&amp;gt;run + vm-&amp;gt;run-&amp;gt;io.data_offset) = ret;
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
In kernel we invoke the &lt;span&gt;open&lt;/span&gt; hypercall with:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/* kernel/hypercalls/hp_open.c */
int hp_open(uint32_t filename_paddr) {
  int ret = 0;
  asm(
    &quot;mov dx, %[port];&quot; /* hypercall number */
    &quot;mov eax, %[data];&quot;
    &quot;out dx, eax;&quot; /* trigger hypervisor to handle the hypercall */
    &quot;in eax, dx;&quot;  /* get return value of the hypercall */
    &quot;mov %[ret], eax;&quot;
    : [ret] &quot;=r&quot;(ret)
    : [port] &quot;r&quot;(NR_HP_open), [data] &quot;r&quot;(filename_paddr)
    : &quot;rax&quot;, &quot;rdx&quot;
  );
  return ret;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you should know all things to implement a simple Linux kernel running under KVM. Some details are worthy to be mentioned during the implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;execve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My kernel is able to execute a simple ELF, to do this you will need knowledge with structure of ELF, which is too complicated to introduce here. You can refer to the source code of Linux for details: &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.woboq.org/linux/linux/fs/binfmt_elf.c.html#load_elf_binary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;linux/fs/binfmt_elf.c#load_elf_binary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;memory allocator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need &lt;span&gt;malloc&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;free&lt;/span&gt; for kernel, try to implement a memory allocator by yourself!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;paging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kernel has to handle the &lt;span&gt;mmap&lt;/span&gt; request from user mode, so you will need to modify the page tables during runtime. Be care of NOT mixing kernel-only addresses with user-accessible addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;permission checking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All arguments passed from user-mode most be carefully checked. I've implemented checking methods in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/david942j/kvm-kernel-example/blob/master/kernel/mm/uaccess.c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kernel/mm/uaccess.c&lt;/a&gt;. Without properly checking, user-mode may be able to do arbitrary read/write on kernel-space, which is a severe security issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This post introduces how to implement a KVM-based hypervisor and a simple Linux kernel, wish it can help you know about KVM and Linux more clearly.&lt;br/&gt;I know I've omitted many details here, especially for the kernel part. Since this post is intended to be an introduction of KVM, I think this arrangement is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or find bugs in my code, leave comments here or file an issue on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/david942j/kvm-kernel-example&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;If this post is helpful to you, I'll be very grateful to see 'thanks' on twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/david942j&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@david942j&lt;/a&gt; :D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Federal judge finds state law governing who is an engineer violates free speech</title>
<link>https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2018/12/federal-judge-finds-state-law-governing-who-is-an-engineer-violates-free-speech.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2018/12/federal-judge-finds-state-law-governing-who-is-an-engineer-violates-free-speech.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A federal magistrate judge has declared that certain parts of state law and its administrative rules that govern engineering practices in Oregon violate the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Stacie F. Beckerman made the ruling Friday in a case filed by a Beaverton man, Mats Järlström , against the Oregon Board of Examiners for Engineering and Land Surveying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Beckerman, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5671551-jarlstrom1.html&quot;&gt;the 25-page written ruling&lt;/a&gt;, declared that Järlström may study and, communicate publicly or privately about his theories relating to traffic lights, as long as his remarks occur outside the context of any employment or contractual relationship with a governmental or other group that regulates traffic light-timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jarlstrom also may describe himself publicly and privately, using the word “engineer,’’ the judge ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The ruling is a win for Jarlstrom, who has been challenging state law for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jarlstrom, who holds a bachelors of science degree in engineering from Sweden, has repeatedly challenged Oregon’s timing of yellow traffic lights as too short. He was investigated by the Oregon Board of Examiners for Engineering and Land Surveying for the “unlicensed practice of engineering,’’ after he sent his traffic light calculations to the state board, and identified himself as an engineer to local media and the “60 Minutes” TV news program, and in discussions with the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Jarlstrom’s interest stemmed from a red-light-running ticket his wife received in 2013. He spent three years analyzing the method for calculating the duration of a yellow light and found that the formula failed to account for drivers who must slow down to make a legal turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The state fined him $500 for violating a state law that governs who may call themselves an engineer, finding he wasn’t an Oregon-registered professional engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2017/12/state_board_concedes_it_violat.html&quot; data-enhanced=&quot;small&quot;&gt;State board concedes it violated free speech rights of red-light camera critic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Last year, the state board conceded in court it violated Jarlstrom’s free speech rights and pledged it would not pursue the Beaverton man any further when he's not acting in a commercial or professional manner and urged a federal judge to dismiss the case. The state also refunded its $500 fine against Jarlstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Beaverton man and his lawyer countered that the state's proposed settlement didn’t go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Järlström, backed by a lawyer from the national Institute for Justice, asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.oregonlive.com/portland_impact/other/jarlstromproposedjudgement.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the court to take a broader look at the state law and its administrative rules and declare them unconstitutional&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the alternative, the state law should be restricted to only regulating engineering communications that are made as part of paid employment or a contractual agreement, his lawyers argued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Beckerman ruled that the state’s definition of an “engineer’’ is overbroad, and cited the state board’s “history of overzealous enforcement actions.’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;She directed the state to remove the definition of &quot;engineer,'' from its state law and administrative rules, and simply restrict who can consider themselves a “professional engineer,” or a “registered professional engineer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The state’s limits that bar anyone who is not registered as a professional engineer in Oregon from describing themselves as an engineer violate the First Amendment, the judge ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“First, the statutes prohibit truthfully describing oneself as an ‘engineer,’ in any context,’’ the judge wrote. “This restriction clearly controls and suppresses protected speech, and enforcement of the statute against protected speech is not a hypothetical threat. The record before this Court demonstrates that the Board has repeatedly targeted individuals for using the title ‘engineer’ in non-commercial contexts, including core political speech such as campaigning for public office and advocacy against a local ballot initiative.’’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Unlike an “M.D.” or “certified public accountant,” there is no fixed meaning to the title “engineer,” but many different types of engineers, the judge found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The judge also ruled that Järlström may describe himself publicly and privately using the word “engineer,’’ and the state board can’t enforce the Professional Engineer Registration Act, or any of its regulations against Järlström for what he did regarding the traffic-light timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The court noted the state has since adopted new regulations that will prevent the board from taking similar regulatory actions against Järlström or others like him who engage in engineering outside of a commercial or professional context.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Netflix stops paying the ‘Apple tax’ on its $853M in annual iOS revenue</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, Netflix was seen testing &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/netflix-itunes-2/&quot;&gt;a bypass of iTunes billing&lt;/a&gt; across dozens of markets worldwide. As 2018 draws to a close, Netflix — &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/16/top-grossing-ios-apps-in-2018-list/&quot;&gt;the App Store’s top grossing app&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/28/netflix-permanently-pulls-itunes-billing-for-new-users/&quot;&gt;has ditched the ability&lt;/a&gt; for new users to sign up and subscribe to the streaming service within its iOS app across all global markets. The change means Apple will miss out on hundreds of millions in App Store revenue per year — money it would have otherwise received by way of its standard cut of in-app transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to new data compiled by Sensor Tower, Netflix grossed $853 million in 2018 on the iOS App Store. Based on that figure, Apple’s take would have been around $256 million, the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the Netflix iOS app has generated more than $1.5 billion through its in-app subscriptions, with Apple’s cut coming in around $450 million-plus, Sensor Tower estimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the change, Netflix on iOS was grossing an average of $2.4 million per day in 2018 — meaning Apple was making around $700,000 by doing nothing other than allowing Netflix to offer subscriptions in its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note, however, that Sensor Tower’s figures are based on the App Store’s 30 percent cut of transactions. After the first year, Apple’s cut on subscription renewals is &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/apple-to-introduce-search-ads-on-app-store-along-with-changes-to-app-review-discovery-and-splits/?_ga=2.247083970.715518535.1546268315-65650910.1541640065&quot;&gt;lowered to 15 percent&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not being factored in. But it gives you a rough idea of Apple’s losses here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix’s iOS revenue has been climbing steadily over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, its gross subscriber revenue was $510 million — up from $215 million users spent in the app in 2016 — which earned it &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/12/netflix-was-2017s-top-non-game-app-by-revenue/&quot;&gt;the No. 1 spot&lt;/a&gt; on the Top Grossing Chart for non-game apps. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/app-downloads-across-ios-google-play-up-10-to-113b-in-2018-consumer-spend-tops-76b/&quot;&gt;snagged that position&lt;/a&gt; again this year, trailed by Tinder and Tencent Video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Netflix has earned the bragging rights for being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/these-are-the-top-iphone-apps-of-all-time/&quot;&gt;top-grossing iOS App of all time&lt;/a&gt;, App Annie reported this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streaming service’s decision to bypass the App Store isn’t a first. Many companies today direct their users to the web or other platforms in order to avoid marketplace fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Amazon has historically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201422920&quot;&gt;restricted&lt;/a&gt; movie and TV rentals and purchases to its own website or other “compatible” apps, instead of allowing them to take place through its Prime Video app. The same goes for Kindle e-books, which also aren’t offered in the Kindle mobile app. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.spotify.com/us/account_payment_help/subscription_information/spotify-through-the-app-store/&quot;&gt;Spotify also discontinued&lt;/a&gt; the option to pay for its Premium service using Apple’s in-app payment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Epic Games this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/03/epic-games-sidesteps-the-play-store-with-fortnite-for-android-launch/&quot;&gt;bypassed Google’s Play Store altogether&lt;/a&gt; — as well as its 30 percent cut — when it launched Fortnite for Android as a sideloaded app. That decision &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/google-will-lose-50-million-or-more-from-fortnite-bypassing-the-play-store/&quot;&gt;resulted&lt;/a&gt; in Google’s loss of $50 million+ in marketplaces fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.netflix.com/en/node/42851&quot;&gt;earlier this year had dropped&lt;/a&gt; in-app subscription sign-ups in its Android app on Google Play. That signaled its intentions to later take back the so-called “Apple tax” for itself, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Netflix still earns money on Google Play through existing subscribers. That totaled around $105 million in 2018, with Google earning close to $32 million of that. But the number has been declining consistently, Sensor Tower said. Apple could soon be in the same boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/28/netflix-permanently-pulls-itunes-billing-for-new-users/&quot;&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt; was the first to notice the change to the Netflix iOS app. It would be surprising if Apple took action against Netflix, given it has not done so with other major tech companies that made similar moves.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let&amp;#039;s Encrypt: Looking Forward to 2019</title>
<link>https://letsencrypt.org/2018/12/31/looking-forward-to-2019.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://letsencrypt.org/2018/12/31/looking-forward-to-2019.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s Encrypt had a great year in 2018. We’re now serving more than 150 million websites while maintaining a stellar security and compliance track record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly though, the Web went from 67% encrypted page loads to 77% in 2018, according to statistics from Mozilla. This is an incredible rate of change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank all of the people and organizations who worked hard to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we created a new website for the legal entity behind Let’s Encrypt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abetterinternet.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)&lt;/a&gt;, because we believe there will be other instances beyond Let’s Encrypt in which ISRG might be able to help to build, or improve access to, a better Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re proud of what we accomplished in 2018, we spend most of our time looking forward rather than back. As we wrap up our own planning process for 2019, I’d like to share some of our plans with you, including both the things we’re excited about and the challenges we’ll face. We’ll cover service growth, new features, infrastructure, and finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-growth&quot;&gt;Service Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s Encrypt helps to drive HTTPS adoption by offering a free, easy to use, and globally available option for obtaining the certificates required to enable HTTPS. HTTPS adoption on the Web took off at an unprecedented rate from the day Let’s Encrypt launched to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of certificates and unique domains we support continues to grow rapidly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect strong growth again in 2019, likely up to 120M active certificates and 215M fully qualified domains. You can view our recently revamped &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/stats/&quot;&gt;stats page&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Let’s Encrypt is so easy to use is that our community has done great work making client software that works well for a wide variety of platforms. We’d like to thank everyone involved in the development of more than 85 &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/&quot;&gt;client software options&lt;/a&gt; for Let’s Encrypt. Support for our protocol, ACME, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2017/10/17/acme-support-in-apache-httpd.html&quot;&gt;built in to Apache&lt;/a&gt; and we’re hoping 2019 will be the year that it comes to Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other organizations and communities are also doing great work to promote HTTPS adoption, and thus stimulate demand for our services. For example, browsers are starting to make their users more aware of the risks associated with unencrypted HTTP (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/15/secure-contexts-everywhere/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/milestone-chrome-security-marking-http-not-secure/&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;). Many hosting providers and CDNs are making it easier than ever for all of their customers to use HTTPS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://https.cio.gov/&quot;&gt;Government agencies&lt;/a&gt; are waking up to the need for stronger security to protect constituents. The media community is working to &lt;a href=&quot;https://securethe.news/&quot;&gt;Secure the News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 we introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/upcoming-features/&quot;&gt;several new features&lt;/a&gt;, including ACMEv2 support and wildcard certificates. We’ve got some exciting features planned for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature we’re most excited about is multi-perspective validation. Currently, when a subscriber requests a certificate, we validate domain control from a single network perspective. This is standard practice for CAs. If an attacker along the network path for the validation check can interfere with traffic they can potentially cause certificates to be issued that should not be issued. We’re most concerned about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/publications/bgp-tls-usenix18.pdf&quot;&gt;happening via BGP hijacking&lt;/a&gt;, and since BGP is not going to be secured any time soon, we needed to find another mitigation. The solution we intend to deploy in 2019 is multi-perspective validation, in which we will check from multiple network perspectives (distinct Autonomous Systems). This means that potential BGP hijackers would need to hijack multiple routes at the same time in order to pull off a successful attack, which is significantly more difficult than hijacking a single route. We are working with a talented research team at Princeton to design the most effective multi-perspective validation system we can, and have already turned parts of this feature on in our staging environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also planning to introduce a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.certificate-transparency.org/&quot;&gt;Certificate Transparency (CT) log&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. All certificate authorities like Let’s Encrypt are required to submit certificates to CT logs but there are not enough stable logs in the ecosystem. As such, we are moving forward with plans to run a log which all CAs will be able to submit to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had planned to add ECDSA root and intermediate certificates in 2018 but other priorities ultimately took precedence. We hope to do this in 2019. ECDSA is generally considered to be the future of digital signature algorithms on the Web due to the fact that it is more efficient than RSA. Let’s Encrypt will currently sign ECDSA keys from subscribers, but we sign with the RSA key from one of our intermediate certificates. Once we have an ECDSA root and intermediates, our subscribers will be able to deploy certificate chains which are entirely ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our CA infrastructure is capable of issuing millions of certificates per day with redundancy for stability and a wide variety of security safeguards, both physical and logical. Our infrastructure also generates and signs around 40 million OCSP responses daily, and serves those responses approximately 5.5 billion times per day. We expect these numbers to grow approximately 40% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our physical CA infrastructure currently occupies approximately 55 units of rack space, split between two datacenters, consisting primarily of compute servers, storage, HSMs, switches, and firewalls. When we issue more certificates it puts the most stress on storage for our databases. We regularly invest in more and faster storage for our database servers, and that will continue in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our infrastructure is managed by our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, which is comprised of six people. SRE staff are responsible for building and maintaining all physical and logical CA infrastructure. These staff are largely responsible for our high standards for security and compliance. The team also manages a 24/7/365 on-call schedule and they are primary participants in both security and compliance audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finances&quot;&gt;Finances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pride ourselves on being an efficient organization. In 2019 Let’s Encrypt will secure a massive portion of the Web with a budget of only $3.6M. We believe this represents an incredible value and that contributing to Let’s Encrypt is one of the most effective ways to help create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 2019 fundraising efforts are off to a strong start with Platinum sponsorships from Cisco, OVH, Mozilla, Google Chrome, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Internet Society, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/&quot;&gt;many other Gold and Silver sponsors&lt;/a&gt;. The Ford Foundation has renewed their grant to Let’s Encrypt as well. We are seeking additional sponsorship and grant assistance to meet our full needs for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;support-let-s-encrypt&quot;&gt;Support Let’s Encrypt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We depend on contributions from our community of users and supporters in order to provide our services. If your company or organization would like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/become-a-sponsor/&quot;&gt;sponsor&lt;/a&gt; Let’s Encrypt please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sponsor@letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;sponsor@letsencrypt.org&lt;/a&gt;. We ask that you make an &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/donate/&quot;&gt;individual contribution&lt;/a&gt; if it is within your means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re grateful for the industry and community support that we receive, and we look forward to continuing to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holiday season is all about cute. You've got those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvXBbsRU83Q&quot;&gt;ads&lt;/a&gt; with adorable children and those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYsT942vRA4&quot;&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt; about baby animals with big eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when people encounter too much cuteness, the result can be something scientists call &quot;cute aggression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People &quot;just have this flash of thinking: 'I want to crush it' or 'I want to squeeze it until pops' or 'I want to punch it,' &quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/katherst&quot;&gt;Katherine Stavropoulos&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist in the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Riverside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of all adults have those thoughts sometimes, says Stavropoulos, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00300/full&quot;&gt;published a study about the phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; in early December in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. But those people wouldn't really take a swipe at Bambi or Thumper, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When people feel this way, it's with no desire to cause harm,&quot; Stavropoulos says. The thoughts appear to be an involuntary response to being overwhelmed by a positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cute aggression is often baffling and embarrassing to the people who experience it. Stavropoulos says they think, &quot;This is weird; I'm probably the only one who feels this way. I don't want to hurt it. I just want to eat it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cute aggression was first described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://clarkrelationshiplab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Psychological%20Science-2015-Arag%C3%B3n-259-73.pdf&quot;&gt;researchers at Yale University&lt;/a&gt; several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Stavropoulos, a cute aggressor herself, wanted to know what it looked like in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she and a colleague recorded the electrical activity in the brains of 54 young adults as they looked at images of animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images included both grown-ups and babies. Some had been manipulated to look less appealing. Others were made extra adorable, meaning &quot;big cheeks, big eyes, small noses — all these features we associate with cuteness,&quot; Stavropoulos says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that for the entire group of participants, cuter creatures were associated with greater activity in brain areas involved in emotion. But the more cute aggression a person felt, the more activity the scientists saw in the brain's reward system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suggests people who think about squishing puppies appear to be driven by two powerful forces in the brain. &quot;It's not just reward and it's not just emotion,&quot; Stavropoulos says. &quot;Both systems in the brain are involved in this experience of cute aggression.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination can be overwhelming. And scientists suspect that's why the brain starts producing aggressive thoughts. The idea is that the appearance of these negative emotions helps people get control of the positive ones running amok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It could possibly be that somehow these expressions help us to just sort of get it out and come down off that baby high a little faster,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clemson.edu/business/about/profiles/OARAGON&quot;&gt;Oriana Aragón&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at Clemson University who was part of the Yale team that gave cute aggression its name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressive thoughts in response to adorable creatures are just one example of &quot;dimorphous expressions of positive emotion,&quot; Aragón says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So people who, you know, want to pinch the babies cheeks and growl at the baby are also people who are more likely to cry at the wedding or cry when the baby's born or have nervous laughter,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aragon says she's one of these people: &quot;For me, puppies are just amazing and adorable and cute and I cannot resist them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Long Life Vehicle</title>

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://postalmuseum.si.edu/collections/images/1d_LLV-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Long Life Vehicle approaching man-made pot hole during endurance tests&quot;/&gt;  Long Life Vehicle approaching man-made pot hole during endurance tests.
&lt;p&gt;Until the 1980s, when postal officials looked to buy new vehicles for the service, they combed through existing models for one that best fit their needs. That decade, when the time came to select a new vehicle for the nation’s city letter carriers, officials decided to do things differently. They created a set of criteria for the perfect letter carrier vehicle. Armed with this list of needs, they challenged commercial vehicle industries to create the perfect vehicle from scratch. Officials believed that this method would assure the creation of a vehicle that could last more than twenty years on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three finalists, vehicles produced by Grumman and General Motors, Poveco (Fruehauf &amp;amp; General Automotive Corp), and American Motors, competed in Laredo, Texas, in 1985 over rugged, pothole-filled streets, moving from stops and starts dozens of times an hour to speeding up in order to match freeway traffic. During these tests, which totaled 24,000 miles in all, officials challenged each vehicle’s endurance and maneuverability. A series of drills was created to replicate the demands of city letter carriers on their vehicles. Each vehicle was required to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive 5,760 miles on a closed loop 5-mile-long paved road at 50 to 55 mph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive 11,520 miles over a gravel road at 30 to 45 mph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive 2,880 miles over a road with a shoulder, stopping every 250 feet and accelerating to 15 mph in between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive 960 miles over cobblestones that ranged from 3 to 4 inches high at 10 to 14 mph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive 960 miles over potholes at 10 to 14 mph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haul a 1 -ton pound load during one half of the road test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haul a man and a 400 pound load during one half of the road test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive over potholes ensuring that each wheel hits a pothole 35,000 times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make one hundred consecutive stops from 15 mph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials required that the manufacturers produce a vehicle with a weather-tight aluminum alloy body. The body had to be easy to enter and exit for carriers ranging from 4’11” tall to those standing at 6’2” and 210 pounds. Finally, and most importantly, the vehicle had to be able to run twenty hours a day, seven days a week, month after month, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://postalmuseum.si.edu/collections/images/1d_LLV-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Long Life Vehicle on exhibit at the National Postal Museum&quot;/&gt; Long Life Vehicle on exhibit at the National Postal Museum.
&lt;p&gt;When the dust settled, Grumman Corporation’s “Long Life Vehicle,” or LLV, was declared the winner. The first of these boxy, right-hand drive LLVs began service in 1986. The LLV’s body was manufactured by Grumman, the chassis by General Motors. The truck body is made from corrosion-resistant aluminum, weighs 3,000 pounds, can carry 1,000 pounds of mail and has a tight turning radius. The Postal Service ordered 99,150 Long Life Vehicles. At a cost of $11,651 per vehicle, the USPS contract with Grumman totaled over $1.1 billion ad was the largest vehicle order ever placed by the postal service. The Long Life Vehicles were produced in Grumman’s Montgomery, Pennsylvania plant. During the height of production, the company was producing 100 postal trucks per day. The 1 1/2-ton Long Life Vehicle in the museum’s collections is numbered 7200001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last LLV was built in 1994. Even though the vehicles were designed to meet a number of challenges, at least two design imperfections began to appear once the vehicles were put to their paces in working conditions. The windowless cargo area restricted carrier visibility and the vehicles were too low in the front, making navigation through deep snow problematic. While LLVs are still moving carriers and their mail along city streets across the United States, they are slowly being replaced, many having served steadily for over 20 years. Among the vehicle types replacing LLVs is the Flexible Fuel Vehicle, or FFV. As its name suggests, the FFV is a more fuel efficient vehicle, operating on a combination of unleaded gas and ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;

During the tests, which totaled 24,000 miles in all, officials challenged the endurance and maneuverability of three vehicles produced by Grumman and General Motors, Poveco (Fruehauf &amp;amp; General Automotive Corp), and American Motors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;“Inescapable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;“It's a constant stressor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;“I see no way out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;What do professors, real estate agents, farmers, business executives, computer programmers and store clerks have in common?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;They’re not immune to the harsh reality of living paycheck to paycheck, according to dozens of people who responded to a Washington Post inquiry on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;They’re millennials, Gen Xers and baby boomers. They work in big cities and rural towns. They’ve tried to save — but rent, child care, student loans and medical bills get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;National data on the paycheck-to-paycheck experience is flimsy, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201805.pdf&quot;&gt;a recent report&lt;/a&gt; from the Federal Reserve spotlights the prevalence of extra-tight budgets: Four in 10 adults say they couldn’t produce $400 in an emergency without sliding into debt or selling something, according to the 2017 figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/12/workers-are-ghosting-their-employers-like-bad-dates/?utm_term=.fe5e0da69c43&quot;&gt;Workers are ghosting their jobs like bad dates&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;The partial government shutdown, which began last Friday and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/21/she-wanted-buy-her-grandkids-bike-christmas-now-shutdown-looms/?utm_term=.e97a42b504a2&quot;&gt;temporarily halting pay&lt;/a&gt; for some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-would-happen-if-the-government-shut-down-late-paychecks-closed-museums-and-more/2018/12/21/79c982a2-053e-11e9-b6a9-0aa5c2fcc9e4_story.html?utm_term=.e6759099178f&quot;&gt;800,000 federal workers,&lt;/a&gt; has touched off a heated discussion on Twitter about what it means to get by in the United States. (President Trump warned this closure could “last a very long time” if Congress doesn’t meet his demands for billions of dollars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-leans-on-mcconnell-to-pass-spending-bill-with-border-funding-in-senate/2018/12/21/31bb453a-0517-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?utm_term=.a807b7326d44&quot;&gt;for a border wall&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Even brief income lapses can spell disaster for some households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;“My husband is a Park Ranger in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and he had to sign his furlough papers,” one woman &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TaylorFutch1/status/1077049606293409792&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. ”We have a 4 yr. old and a 4-month-old, and we don’t know when his next check will come. Mortgage is due, Christmas 2 days away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;“Broke my lease to accept new fed job for which I have to attend 7 months of training in another state,” another Twitter user said. (He later deleted the tweet). “Training canceled with shutdown. Homeless. Can’t afford short(?)-term housing/have to work full-time for no pay/returning Christmas presents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;These and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShutdownStories?src=hash&quot;&gt;#ShutdownStories&lt;/a&gt; took off online after U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) suggested last week that a gap in wages wouldn’t be so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;“Who’s living that they’re not going to make it to the next paycheck?” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pennlive.com/news/2018/12/us-rep-scott-perry-gets-notice-aka-flak-for-comments-on-potential-federal-shutdown.html&quot;&gt;asked reporters&lt;/a&gt;, adding that most of those impacted would qualify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/21/she-wanted-buy-her-grandkids-bike-christmas-now-shutdown-looms/?utm_term=.283fe909fe3f&quot;&gt;for back pay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;According to economists: A lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;“It’s astronomical what people need just to make it month to month,” said Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist at the Department of Labor who now studies how middle-class families spend their wages at the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington think tank that is funded by foundations and unions. “Given the high cost of transportation, housing, health care … There is often no wiggle room.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;About 2,000 custodians, security guards, housekeepers and other federal building workers are losing money this holiday season because of the shutdown, according to 32BJ SEIU, an East Coast labor union — and because such staffers are employed by contractors, they won’t be eligible for makeup checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;“My supervisor told me we won’t be getting paid,” one State Department cleaner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/21/she-wanted-buy-her-grandkids-bike-christmas-now-shutdown-looms/?utm_term=.e97a42b504a2&quot;&gt;told The Post&lt;/a&gt; last week, “so my bills won’t be getting paid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/21/she-wanted-buy-her-grandkids-bike-christmas-now-shutdown-looms/?utm_term=.458aef65dc45&quot;&gt;She wanted to buy her grandkids a bike for Christmas. Then came the shutdown.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;Beyond the federal labor sphere, workers across a variety of professions struggle to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Sol Smith, chair of liberal arts at a Southern California college, said he landed his job after earning three degrees. But with four daughters and mounting health care costs, he said, saving just isn’t possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;“I see no way out,” he wrote in an email to The Post. “I am 40, have built a strong career, have 17 years experience, and if something were to happen to me, my wife and kids would be homeless within a year when my life insurance ran out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot; class=&quot;interstitial-link&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://hosted-washpost.submissionplatform.com/sub/hosted/5c23f49363d665002cf88c34&quot;&gt;Are you living on a tight budget? What questions do you have for The Post?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Lani Harrison, 43, said she and her software engineer husband have trouble buying groceries after paying the $2,249 rent on their two-bedroom Los Angeles apartment. They’re raising three young kids and rely on her husband’s income, she said. Her work as a certified car seat installer earns her $40 per appointment, but the work isn’t steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;“Each month, we have to stretch his paycheck to make things work,” she said. “We really don’t have any savings. Many months we go under.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Sometimes, she confides in trusted friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;“I’m often surprised that their stories are so similar to ours,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Dillon Holt, a housekeeping assistant at a Nashville hotel, said he’s down to one piece of chicken in his freezer. His checking account often hovers around zero, and he is unable to put away any money for the future or an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;“I make $12.50, work 40-50 hours a week,” he said. “I still don’t have a savings account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;Emily Webb, 38, said she works full time as an arts administrator in Columbus, Ohio, and waits tables on the side. Staying afloat each month, she said, is a precarious dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;“It’s a scramble at the end of a paycheck to deposit my tips and make sure none of my automatic payments bounce,” said Webb, who has master’s degree but cannot make her student loan payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;She’s grateful to work in her field, though, and loves her job. One big financial boost, she said, awaits her at the end of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;“I can finally pay off my 9-year-old car,” Webb said. “The plastic part of the back bumper was slowly sliding off the back of it. I got rear-ended by an uninsured driver 2 years ago, so I reattached it with zip ties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;I am a EE, hardware engineer with about a decade of experience in PCB electronics and systems engineering experience which includes a brief stint at a FAANG that also happens to be an E-tailer. I have been &quot;dabbling&quot; in Python for about a year now and just recently started with DL using PyTorch and find it quite interesting. To be clear I don't write code at work, atleast not until now. I intend to utilize any free resources (MOOCs) to teach myself the latest techniques in DL for CV. What I am not clear is the next logical step.A part of me wants to Boostrap a SAAS using Python stack to build something that I can market using the traditional channels(PH,Show HN,Reddit,answer SO questions) and show it to potential employers but am not sure if I will even get to the interview stage with a resume but that doesn't look anything like a programmer with a tradional CS background and work experience to boot. Sorry about the long and winding question, but what should I do to get noticed by recruiters at FAANG and non-FAANG to stand apart from the CS crowd?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td/&gt;

<title>People with Depression Use Language Differently</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theconversation.com/people-with-depression-use-language-differently-heres-how-to-spot-it-90877</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;From the way you move and sleep, to how you interact with people around you, depression changes just about everything. It is even noticeable in the way you speak and express yourself in writing. Sometimes this “language of depression” can have a powerful effect on others. Just consider the impact of the poetry and song lyrics of Sylvia Plath and Kurt Cobain, who both killed themselves after suffering from depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long tried to pin down the exact relationship between depression and language, and technology is helping us get closer to a full picture. Our new study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702617747074&quot;&gt;published in Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;, has now unveiled a class of words that can help accurately predict whether someone is suffering from depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, linguistic analyses in this field have been carried out by researchers reading and taking notes. Nowadays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X09351676&quot;&gt;computerised text analysis methods&lt;/a&gt; allow the processing of extremely large data banks in minutes. This can help spot linguistic features which humans may miss, calculating the percentage prevalence of words and classes of words, lexical diversity, average sentence length, grammatical patterns and many other metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930441000030&quot;&gt;personal essays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00627.x/full&quot;&gt;diary entries&lt;/a&gt; by depressed people have been useful, as has the work of well-known artists such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt0dh4553j/qt0dh4553j.pdf&quot;&gt;Cobain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2001/07000/Word_Use_in_the_Poetry_of_Suicidal_and_Nonsuicidal.1.aspx&quot;&gt;Plath&lt;/a&gt;. For the spoken word, snippets of &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-02410-015&quot;&gt;natural language&lt;/a&gt; of people with depression have also provided insight. Taken together, the findings from such research reveal clear and consistent differences in language between those with and without symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language can be separated into two components: content and style. The content relates to what we express – that is, the meaning or subject matter of statements. It will surprise no one to learn that those with symptoms of depression use an excessive amount of words conveying &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0261927X09351676&quot;&gt;negative emotions&lt;/a&gt;, specifically negative adjectives and adverbs – such as “lonely”, “sad” or “miserable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting is the use of pronouns. Those with symptoms of depression use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930441000030&quot;&gt;significantly more first person singular pronouns&lt;/a&gt; – such as “me”, “myself” and “I” – and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6176285&quot;&gt;significantly fewer&lt;/a&gt; second and third person pronouns – such as “they”, “them” or “she”. This pattern of pronoun use suggests people with depression are more focused on themselves, and less connected with others. Researchers have reported that pronouns are actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237378690_The_Psychological_Functions_of_Function_Words&quot;&gt;more reliable&lt;/a&gt; in identifying depression than negative emotion words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/6/5/548/1656513&quot;&gt;rumination&lt;/a&gt; (dwelling on personal problems) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ageing-and-society/article/preventing-social-isolation-and-loneliness-among-older-people-a-systematic-review-of-health-promotion-interventions/06510CBA74BBCF3FD2821BB96525647C&quot;&gt;social isolation&lt;/a&gt; are common features of depression. However, we don’t know whether these findings reflect differences in attention or thinking style. Does depression cause people to focus on themselves, or do people who focus on themselves get symptoms of depression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style of language relates to how we express ourselves, rather than the content we express. Our lab recently conducted a big data text analysis of 64 different online mental health forums, examining over 6,400 members. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2167702617747074/suppl_file/Table_S2_Supplemental_Material.pdf&quot;&gt;Absolutist words&lt;/a&gt;” – which convey absolute magnitudes or probabilities, such as “always”, “nothing” or “completely” – were found to be better markers for mental health forums than either pronouns or negative emotion words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outset, we predicted that those with depression will have a more black and white view of the world, and that this would manifest in their style of language. Compared to 19 different control forums (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mumsnet.com/&quot;&gt;Mumsnet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/&quot;&gt;StudentRoom&lt;/a&gt;), the prevalence of absolutist words is approximately 50% greater in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/forum365.html&quot;&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/forum366.html&quot;&gt;depression forums&lt;/a&gt;, and approximately 80% greater for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suicideforum.com/&quot;&gt;suicidal ideation forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pronouns produced a similar distributional pattern as absolutist words across the forums, but the effect was smaller. By contrast, negative emotion words were paradoxically less prevalent in suicidal ideation forums than in anxiety and depression forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research also included &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/online-forums/staying-well&quot;&gt;recovery forums&lt;/a&gt;, where members who feel they have recovered from a depressive episode write positive and encouraging posts about their recovery. Here we found that negative emotion words were used at comparable levels to control forums, while positive emotion words were elevated by approximately 70%. Nevertheless, the prevalence of absolutist words remained significantly greater than that of controls, but slightly lower than in anxiety and depression forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, those who have previously had depressive symptoms are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2169519/&quot;&gt;more likely to have them again&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, their greater tendency for absolutist thinking, even when there are currently no symptoms of depression, is a sign that it may play a role in causing depressive episodes. The same effect is seen in use of pronouns, but not for negative emotion words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the language of depression can help us understand the way those with symptoms of depression think, but it also has practical implications. Researchers are combining automated text analysis with &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/deepmind-can-we-ever-trust-a-machine-to-diagnose-cancer-88707&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; (computers that can learn from experience without being programmed) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6784326/&quot;&gt;classify a variety of mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; from natural language text samples such as blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such classification is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223891.1990.9673995&quot;&gt;already outperforming&lt;/a&gt; that made by trained therapists. Importantly, machine learning classification will only improve as more data is provided and more sophisticated algorithms are developed. This goes beyond looking at the broad patterns of absolutism, negativity and pronouns already discussed. Work has begun on using computers to accurately identify increasingly specific subcategories of mental health problems – such as perfectionism, self-esteem problems and social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it is of course possible to use a language associated with depression without actually being depressed. Ultimately, it is how you feel over time that determines whether you are suffering. But as the World Health Organisation estimates that more than 300m people worldwide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mental_health/management/depression/en/&quot;&gt;are now living with depression&lt;/a&gt;, an increase of more than 18% since 2005, having more tools available to spot the condition is certainly important to improve health and prevent tragic suicides such as those of Plath and Cobain.&lt;/p&gt;
