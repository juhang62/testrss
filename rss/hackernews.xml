<description>&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may combine any of the options above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to get a specific image that is grayscale and blurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;break-words&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;no-underline&quot; href=&quot;https://picsum.photos/id/870/200/300?grayscale&amp;amp;blur=2&quot;&gt;https://picsum.photos/id/870/200/300?grayscale&amp;amp;blur=2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To request multiple images of the same size in your browser, you need to add a random parameter to prevent the images from being cached&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;break-words&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=1&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img src=&quot;https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=2&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a file ending, you can add &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the url.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;break-words&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;no-underline&quot; href=&quot;https://picsum.photos/200/300.jpg&quot;&gt;https://picsum.photos/200/300.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

<title>Thousands take to Hong Kong streets to protest new extradition laws</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-politics-extradition-idUSKCN1S405E</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-politics-extradition-idUSKCN1S405E</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, April 28 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people marched on Hong Kong’s parliament on Sunday to demand the scrapping of proposed extradition rules that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial - a move which some fear puts the city’s core freedoms at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents of the proposal fear further erosion of rights and legal protections in the free-wheeling financial hub - freedoms which were guaranteed under the city’s handover from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranks of marchers snaked peacefully for more than three hours through the shopping and business districts of Causeway Bay and Wanchai, with thousands staying on into the evening outside the Legislative Council and government headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police said 22,800 people marched at the peak of the procession, but organizers estimated 130,000 turned out - making it one of the largest street protests in the city for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observers said the turnout dwarved an earlier protest against the plan last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veteran activist and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung said the government’s move risked removing Hong Kongers’ “freedom from fear”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hong Kong people and visitors passing by Hong Kong will lose their right not to be extradited into mainland China,” he said. “They would need to face an unjust legal system on the mainland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some younger marchers said they were worried about traveling to the mainland after the move, which comes just as the government encourages young people to deepen ties with the mainland and promotes Hong Kong’s links with southern China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law clerk Edward Wen, 45, said the difference in human rights standards between Hong Kong and the mainland was too great to bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You will be screwed as long as they put up a crime on your behalf,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marchers’ chanted demands for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to step down echoed through the high-rise streets, with some protesters saying she had “betrayed” Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sported yellow umbrellas - the symbol of the Occupy pro-democracy movement that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for 11 weeks in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed changes have sparked an unusually broad chorus of concern from international business elites to lawyers and rights’ groups and even some pro-establishment figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong who handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997, on Saturday described the move as “an assault on Hong Kong’s values, stability and security”, government-funded broadcaster RTHK reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LOOPHOLES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Lam and other government officials are standing fast by their proposals, calling them vital to plug long-standing loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the changes, the Hong Kong leader would have the right to order the extradition of wanted offenders to China, Macau and Taiwan as well as other countries not covered by Hong Kong’s existing extradition treaties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a safeguard, such orders, to be issued case-by-case, could be challenged and appealed through the city’s vaunted legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government officials have said no one at risk of the death penalty or torture or facing a political charge could be sent from Hong Kong. Under pressure from local business groups, they earlier exempted nine commercial crimes from the new provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals could be passed into law later in the year, with the city’s pro-democratic camp no longer holding enough seats to block the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has justified the swift introduction of the changes by saying they are needed so a young Hong Kong man suspected of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan can be extradited to face charges there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s assurances are not enough for Lam Wing-kee, a former Hong Kong political bookseller who said in 2016 he was abducted by mainland agents in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lam left Hong Kong for Taiwan last week, saying he feared being sent back to the mainland under the new laws and his experience showed he could have no trust in China’s legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of 33 followers of Falun Gong, a religious sect banned in China, flew from Taiwan to Hong Kong on Saturday to join the march but were refused entry to Hong Kong, RTHK reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday’s march comes amid renewed calls for deeper electoral reforms stalled five years ago after Occupy protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four leaders of the movement were last week sentenced to jail terms ranging from eight to 16 months, part of a group of nine activists found guilty after a near month-long trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;descriptor&quot;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/span&gt; A &quot;hero&quot; project is one where 80% or more of the contributions are made by the 20% of the developers. In the literature, such projects are deprecated since they might cause bottlenecks in development and communication. However, there is little empirical evidence on this matter. Further, recent studies show that such hero projects are very prevalent. Accordingly, this paper explores the effect of having heroes in project, from a code quality perspective. We identify the heroes developer communities in 1100+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis, we find that (a) hero projects are majorly all projects; and (b) the commits from &quot;hero developers&quot; (who contribute most to the code) result in far fewer bugs than other developers. That is, contrary to the literature, heroes are standard and very useful part of modern open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The gig economy is quietly undermining a century of worker protections</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;No kid ever dreamed of growing up and driving for Uber or styling for Stitch Fix. In part, that’s because none of those companies existed when most of today’s adults were young. It’s also because, besides its much-touted “flexibility,” the gig economy isn’t much of a place to build a career. Instead, over the course of less than a decade, the self-described “tech companies” that connect people to gig work have managed to erode hard-fought labor protections in place for a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520300569/hustle-and-gig&quot;&gt;Hustle and Gig&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; to be published in March by University of California Press, sociologist Alexandrea Ravenelle interviews 80 gig workers who are struggling, striving, and succeeding. She analyzes their stories in the context of US employment history and concludes that “for all its app-enabled modernity, the gig economy resembles the early industrial age…the sharing economy is truly a movement forward to the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Although gig work was initially seen as a way to maximize worker freedom and create opportunities, it has, in its short history, proven corrosive. Ravenelle notes that a small percentage of people are making lots of money via side hustles, but they tend to be those who need it least. For example, she speaks to independent hoteliers in New York renting out rooms and apartments via AirBnB, including a corporate lawyer and a man with a chain of laundromats. Because they already had capital, have steady sources of income apart from their side gigs, and are willing to skirt rental laws, these two individuals are able to invest heavily in their “gigs” and create lucrative businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Sadly, those who most need to work can find themselves trapped in a cycle of struggle. Ravenelle interviewed men and women signed up to do tasks on Task Rabbit—prior to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/9/28/16377528/ikea-acquisition-taskrabbit-shopping-home-contract-labor&quot;&gt;acquisition by IKEA&lt;/a&gt;—and who drove for Uber, for example. They were not employees and so had no health insurance, workers’ compensation protections, employer contributions to Social Security and payroll taxes, paid time off, family leave protections, discrimination protections, or unemployment insurance benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Sometimes, this gig work also requires an initial outlay of capital. (My own neighbor just traded in her old vehicle for a new car, taking on thousands of dollars in debt so that she can make extra money driving for Lyft.) At the very least, a potential worker needs a smartphone and wi-fi service. Ravanelle’s book boasts an image inside of a young man in a park panhandling for $30 to activate his phone service so that he can start picking up work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Workers take gigs as they come and can’t afford to be too picky, despite the supposed liberty of being your own boss in the sharing economy. Platform algorithms are designed to downgrade those who aren’t always available, making it ever-harder to pick up gigs. All this ends up putting workers in dangerous situations, working for strangers without any protections from their employers. Uber, for example, offers email communications to drivers, a service that is not nearly as responsive as the taxi cab dispatcher, say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;The workers Ravenelle spoke to were hit on at work while in a stranger’s house; injured after taking strenuous moving jobs; found themselves delivering questionable packages containing illegal substances; and drove passengers involved in shady activities, fearing that a protest or refusal would end in violence. In all of these awkward situations, these “independent contractors” were forced to choose between a slew of bad options. They could turn down work when they needed the money and risk finding themselves scrambling more. They could take questionable tasks and hope that it all worked out, which it sometimes did. But that meant exposing themselves to the risk that they would end up hurt and financially responsible for their on-the-job injuries, which would also mean needing unpaid time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;The availability of cheap labor also hasn’t escaped the notice of companies in need of a quick fix. Ravenelle spoke to workers who were doing manual labor, like filling coffee bags for a high-end roaster, that they picked up on an app. In other words,  businesses are also advertising tasks through the supposed peer-to-peer platforms, getting their temps through the new, cheaper system, rather than hiring workers directly. When Ikea acquired TaskRabbit in 2017, it was only making official a relationship that had been developing for years, as furniture buyers hired individuals to put together their Ikea designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7 quartz&quot;&gt;The costs of worker misclassification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Companies can make more money and incur a lot less liability classifying workers as independent contractors, so they do. Technically, by issuing a 1099 to a gig worker instead of a W2 to an employee, the business is financially and socially distanced from the worker. It’s cheaper and easier than employing everyone who works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;But in the long run, Ravenelle argues, we will all lose as a result of this new structure. She notes that the government, and society as a whole, lose billions of dollars annually to worker misclassification, and writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;_9f6a5 quartz&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cruel irony, workers in the sharing economy—hailed as the height of the modern workplace—find themselves without any of the worker protections enjoyed by their great-grandparents. Although workplace protections still exist for full-time and part-time employees, gig workers as independent contractors, are outside the social safety net of basic workplace protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;From California to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/lyft-drivers-sue-argue-that-theyre-employees-rather-than-contractors/&quot;&gt;Massachusetts,&lt;/a&gt; Uber and Lyft drivers, among others, have sued to be classified as employees. A California case was stymied in September when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Lyft drivers had agreed by contract to settle disputes through arbitration, meaning the court didn’t even need to reach the classification question. Worker status was outside the court’s purview, it found, because Uber created a contract that made it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;But some drivers have opted out of the arbitration clause, and their cases may proceed. If they succeed in convincing the court they are employees and not contractors, this may signal the beginning of a much-needed reckoning with tech companies that have used the dated letter of the law to generate great profits at a cost to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_7d6a7 quartz&quot;&gt;How the gig economy creates economic insecurity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;There’s a hidden tax that corporations using contractors are paying for their cheap labor, so some companies see the upside of providing benefits. Ravenelle also speaks to founders who either switched from hiring contractors to employing workers, like the New York cleaning service MyClean, or decided doing so was the right thing to begin with, like the Hello Alfred errand-running service in Manhattan, which attempts to anticipate customer needs and therefore relies on a relationship between workers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;These companies argue that taking care of workers is good for business, although it does mean more administration and initial outlay. Loyal employees are happier, healthier, and do better work. They please customers and don’t need to be replaced or trained as often, which means business improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;But these are rare examples, and their success is threatened by the existence of the many companies who abuse the system. Venture capitalists are more likely to pour money into businesses that can avoid employee liability, which makes it more difficult for responsible employers to compete. As Ravenelle notes, the “gig economy” is profoundly disrupting the deal between workers and businesses in the US, increasing economic insecurity and worker vulnerability and incentivizing investors and businesses to be bad social actors. She calls this “poor quality progress” that hides its regressive tendencies in friendly, unimpeachable language, terms like the “sharing economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;It’s an empty promise, the sociologist argues: “The disruption offered by the sharing economy is simply a hustle.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Machine Learning Books That Helped Me Level Up</title>
<link>http://www.datastuff.tech/data-science/3-machine-learning-books-that-helped-me-level-up-as-a-data-scientist/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.datastuff.tech/data-science/3-machine-learning-books-that-helped-me-level-up-as-a-data-scientist/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a Japanese word, &lt;em&gt;tsundoku&lt;/em&gt; (積ん読), which means buying and keeping a growing collection of books, even though you don’t really read them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we Developers and Data Scientists are particularly prone to falling into this trap. Personally, I even hoard bookmarks: my phone’s Chrome browser has so many open tabs, the counter was replaced with a “:D” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-249&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that zeal for &lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt; most of us experience, we usually end up &lt;strong&gt;lost&lt;/strong&gt;, not sure of &lt;strong&gt;which book to pick up next&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s why today I’ll give you a very &lt;strong&gt;short list&lt;/strong&gt;: just 3 Machine Learning books, so that you won’t just bookmark it and forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these books has &lt;strong&gt;helped me immensely&lt;/strong&gt; in different stages of my &lt;strong&gt;career&lt;/strong&gt; as a Data Scientist, particularly in my role as a Machine Learning Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;O’Reilly: Data Science from Scratch with Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=26ZMGLLYO1JYJ&amp;amp;keywords=data+science+from+scratch&amp;amp;qid=1556431957&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=data+science+from+,aps,284&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;linkCode=li2&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;linkId=607e7dd70b561ca2e59c8cc3c7d9c05c&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=149190142X&amp;amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;l=li2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=149190142X&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll review &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GQ4O7O&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; first, since it’s the most &lt;strong&gt;introductory&lt;/strong&gt; or broad one in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a very personal attachment to this book, since it’s the one that &lt;strong&gt;got me my job&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s right! I knew next to nothing about Data Science, even what Data Science was, before picking up this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have a pretty strong Probability and Statistics background, and knew enough Python to defend myself. However, I was missing the &lt;strong&gt;practical side&lt;/strong&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book did many things for me. It:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showed me how to &lt;strong&gt;process data in Python&lt;/strong&gt; efficiently and elegantly (following Python’s &lt;strong&gt;good practices&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught me how to &lt;strong&gt;implement&lt;/strong&gt; most simple &lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning algorithms&lt;/strong&gt; from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showed me what the &lt;strong&gt;day-to-day job&lt;/strong&gt; of a Data Scientist may look like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught me how to &lt;strong&gt;communicate my results&lt;/strong&gt; to others clearly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly recommend it if you’re &lt;strong&gt;new to the Data Science community&lt;/strong&gt;. It will give you a clear overview of most topics you’ll need in order to start being a productive Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also showcase Python’s most commonly used libraries and expose you to a lot of &lt;strong&gt;idiomatic code&lt;/strong&gt;, which is always a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a link to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DDhIUH&quot;&gt;Data Science from Scratch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Springer: Introduction to Statistical Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=38431H61FET77&amp;amp;keywords=introduction+to+statistical+learning&amp;amp;qid=1556432067&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=introduction+to+stat,aps,318&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;linkCode=li2&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;linkId=0d61569477ce08129f427796f8ef8b3a&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1461471370&amp;amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;l=li2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1461471370&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZP93YS&quot;&gt;This book&lt;/a&gt; is the most comprehensive &lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning book&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve found so far. I learned a lot from it, from &lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt; algorithms like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/k-means-clustering-unsupervised-learning-for-recommender-systems/&quot;&gt;K-Means Clustering&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;strong&gt;Supervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt; ones like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/xgboost-predicting-life-expectancy-with-supervised-learning/&quot;&gt;Boosted Trees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapters may feel a bit too introductory if you’re already working in this field (at least that was my experience). However, they also sum up many things you may not have learned in such an organized way before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later chapters are, however, where I think this book really shines. Its explanation of random forests, boosted trees and support vector machines are spot on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the topics you can learn from &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Statistical Learning&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Supervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt; Algorithms: from &lt;strong&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SVM&lt;/strong&gt;s to &lt;strong&gt;tree-based&lt;/strong&gt; methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Learning&lt;/strong&gt; techniques: especially Clustering, including the K-Means algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sampling methods, and other general Machine Learning &lt;strong&gt;core concepts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meaning, advantages and disadvantages of &lt;strong&gt;metrics&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;accuracy, recall, precision&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this book has been my best read so far this year, and it’s made me into a more round up Data Scientist. I recommend it if you have a bit more experience, but want to &lt;strong&gt;polish your edges.&lt;/strong&gt; It is also a very good &lt;strong&gt;reference&lt;/strong&gt; book to keep on your shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also shows everything’s implementation in R, which I didn’t find particularly useful, but it didn’t hurt. You’ll probably import most of this code from SciKit learn anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, here’s a link to &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZP93YS&quot;&gt;Springer’s Introduction to Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio et al.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=3QTU6Y3VBDH1J&amp;amp;keywords=deep+learning&amp;amp;qid=1556432235&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sprefix=Deep+Learning,aps,288&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;linkCode=li2&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;linkId=3f50a1ee99315e32cc0afcf67d658d91&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=0262035618&amp;amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;l=li2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0262035618&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2J0WjZe&quot;&gt;This book&lt;/a&gt; blows my mind every time I open it. I’ll be the first to admit I haven’t really read it from start to finish. Yet.&lt;br/&gt;The only reason it’s the last one in the list is because of its very &lt;strong&gt;specific scope&lt;/strong&gt;: Artificial &lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However its first chapters, with an overview of Deep Learning’s &lt;strong&gt;precursors&lt;/strong&gt; and what makes it different, and then the explanation of &lt;strong&gt;how Deep Learning works&lt;/strong&gt;, are marvelous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even starts off by explaining everything you need to know &lt;strong&gt;before studying deep learning&lt;/strong&gt;, with whole chapters dedicated to &lt;strong&gt;linear algebra&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;probability&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;information theory&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;numerical computation&lt;/strong&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next chapters, which I’ve only partially read, serve as an awesome &lt;strong&gt;reference&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you need to dive deeper into a particular Neural Network &lt;strong&gt;architecture&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include in-depth explanations of &lt;strong&gt;Convolutional&lt;/strong&gt; Neural Networks and &lt;strong&gt;Recurrent&lt;/strong&gt; Neural Networks, along with many &lt;strong&gt;regularization&lt;/strong&gt; or optimization methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and last section, which revolves around &lt;strong&gt;cutting-edge technology&lt;/strong&gt;, explains &lt;strong&gt;Generative models&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datastuff.tech/machine-learning/autoencoder-deep-learning-tensorflow-eager-api-keras/&quot;&gt;Autoencoders&lt;/a&gt; and many other interesting algorithms. Adding them to your own toolkit will probably give you a great boost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this book are the &lt;strong&gt;rock stars&lt;/strong&gt; of Machine Learning right now. One of them even &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/27/geoffrey-hinton-yann-lecun-and-yoshua-bengio-honored-with-the-turing-award/&quot;&gt;won a Turing award&lt;/a&gt; recently, so I can’t think of better people to teach this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2J0WjZe&quot;&gt;Amazon link&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested in the &lt;em&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/em&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went from a broad, introductory book to an advanced, specific one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these Machine Learning books has had a profound impact in my career and, to some degree, the way I see the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope at least some of them will have the same positive impact on your life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’ve already read, or are reading, any of them, tell me what you think of them in the comments! I’d love to discuss any of them further, especially the Deep Learning book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also discuss them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/strikingloo&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com/@strikingloo&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.to/strikingloo&quot;&gt;dev.to&lt;/a&gt; if you’re interested.&lt;br/&gt;I want to hear your opinions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(small disclaimer: all of these links are Amazon affiliate links, which means I get a small commission if you buy the books. However, I’ll only review books I’ve actually read, and have genuinely recommended to people in real life)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Over 13% of the homes in Japan are abandoned</title>
<link>http://flip.it/XKsblo</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://flip.it/XKsblo</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Japan’s population is shrinking. Last year it fell by nearly 450,000 people. Not &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1507590/japans-population-decline-reached-a-new-record-in-2018/&quot;&gt;since records began&lt;/a&gt; in 1899 had so few babies been born (921,000). Before that, 2017 had also set a record. Meanwhile the number of people passing away last year set a post-war record. The figures are part of a larger pattern in which births have declined and deaths increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1295721/the-japanese-population-is-shrinking-faster-than-every-other-big-country/&quot;&gt;steadily for decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Less noticed is another alarming figure that’s been growing. According to the latest government statistics, the number of abandoned homes in Japan reached a &lt;a href=&quot;https://japantoday.com/category/national/number-of-abandoned-homes-hits-record-high-in-2018&quot;&gt;record high of 8.5 million&lt;/a&gt; as of Oct. 1, 2018, up by 260,000 from five years earlier. As a proportion of total housing stock, abandoned homes reached 13.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Some areas have been hit harder than others. Saitama, north of Tokyo, and tropical Okinawa had the lowest proportions of vacant homes. But the rate topped 20% in the Yamanashi and Wakayama prefectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Japan’s education ministry, meanwhile, has struggled with how to repurpose &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/534715/hot-springs-ham-curing-and-senior-centers-the-new-lives-of-japans-disappearing-schools/&quot;&gt;vacant school buildings&lt;/a&gt;. One became a building for curing meats, another an &lt;em&gt;onsen&lt;/em&gt; (hot springs spa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;a1dbe quartz&quot;&gt;Little wonder Japan, long averse to immigration, is preparing to open its doors wider to foreigners to tackle a worker shortage. But even on that front, the numbers are coming up short: There simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1576719/japans-foreign-worker-boom-depends-on-one-thing-more-japanese-teachers/&quot;&gt;aren’t enough educators&lt;/a&gt; to teach the newcomers Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
