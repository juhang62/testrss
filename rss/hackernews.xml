<title>The Internet Archive is waging war on misinformation</title>
<link>https://www.ft.com/content/5be1f2ee-d60b-11e9-a0bd-ab8ec6435630</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;On a foggy September lunchtime in San Francisco, a group of researchers and data scientists sat around foldable plastic tables in what was once a Christian Science church, evangelising about open-source information and the democratisation of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50-strong party, which had been assembled for a weekly progress discussion, dined downstairs in a pillared building that now houses the Internet Archive, a digital library dedicated to providing “universal access to all knowledge”. As computers hummed on cluttered workstations all around, the employees and a handful of invited guests greeted each update with optimistic applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive, founded in 1996, is a non-profit that collects and digitises information, from films to books. It is best known for the Wayback Machine, a free repository of web pages that allows users to see what a particular URL looked like when it was archived, regardless of whether it has since been changed or taken down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 2016 US election, as fears about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/stream/e26891d0-28f1-44da-ba99-1d148f60335b&quot; data-trackable=&quot;link&quot;&gt;the power of fake news&lt;/a&gt; have intensified, the archive has stepped up its efforts to combat misinformation. At a time when false and ultra-partisan content is rapidly created and spread, and social media pages are constantly updated, the importance of having an unalterable record of who said what, when has been magnified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to put in a layer of accountability,” said founder Brewster Kahle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;n-image-wrapper n-image-wrapper--placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41e66852-d89f-11e9-9c26-419d783e10e8?fit=scale-down&amp;amp;source=next&amp;amp;width=700&quot; data-image-type=&quot;image&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;n-image&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41e66852-d89f-11e9-9c26-419d783e10e8?fit=scale-down&amp;amp;source=next&amp;amp;width=700 700w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41e66852-d89f-11e9-9c26-419d783e10e8?fit=scale-down&amp;amp;source=next&amp;amp;width=500 500w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41e66852-d89f-11e9-9c26-419d783e10e8?fit=scale-down&amp;amp;source=next&amp;amp;width=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 76.25em) 700px, (min-width: 61.25em) 620px, (min-width: 46.25em) 700px, calc(100vw - 20px)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Kahle founded the archive, which now employs more than 100 staff and costs $18m a year to run, because he feared that what was appearing on the internet was not being saved and catalogued in the same way as newspapers and books. The organisation is funded through donations, grants and the fees it charges third parties that request specific digitisation services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the archive has catalogued 330bn web pages, 20m books and texts, 8.5m audio and video recordings, 3m images and 200,000 software programs. The most popular, public websites are prioritised, as are those that are commonly linked to. Some information is free to access, some is loaned out (if copyright laws apply) and some is only available to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curled up in a chair in his office after lunch, Mr Kahle lamented the combined impact of misinformation and how difficult it can be for ordinary people to access reliable sources of facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re bringing up a generation that turns to their screens, without a library of information accessible via screens,” said Mr Kahle. Some have taken advantage of this “new information system”, he argued — and the result is “Trump and Brexit”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a free online library is crucial, said Mr Kahle, since “[the public is] just learning from whatever . . . is easily available”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After President Trump’s election, and as the existence of disinformation campaigns that sought to sway voters came to light, the archive began several new projects. One of these was the Trump Archive, a collection of the US president’s television appearances that now contains more than 6,000 videos, including from before he took office. Separately, as part of the effort to document the 45th president’s often-contradictory statements, the organisation is cataloguing Mr Trump’s tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is “critically important, it’s the communication platform of our time”, said Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine. News feeds on platforms such as Facebook, as well as chat apps, are the “dominant way” many people get information, he said. “That’s how they’re learning about the world” and “who they think their enemy is”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive hopes its repository will help others identify false information and fact-check suspicious content. The emergence of deepfakes — videos that appear to show someone doing or saying something they did not do or say — is a “monster problem”, said Roger Macdonald, director of the organisation’s TV archive. But having a library of videos means experts and algorithms can help spot those that have been tampered with or taken out of context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding what to do about fakes is more difficult, and not part of the archive’s mandate. But Mr Graham argued that simply removing false information or offensive content isn’t necessarily the answer. Hateful material need not remain publicly available, he said, but certain researchers and politicians should be able to study it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, the Wayback Machine does not filter out misinformation. “It’s not about trying to archive the stuff that’s true, but archive the conversation. All of that is what people are experiencing,” said Mr Graham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the internet’s explosive growth in the past two decades — there are currently more than 60tn web pages — the task of archiving it has become increasingly difficult. But Mr Kahle said he is hopeful his organisation is keeping up, at least with cataloguing the most popular, public websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Graham said he was an “optimist”, but conceded that the archive had not yet saved as much as he would like. Take YouTube, for example: the team is only archiving a “small fraction” of all the videos published each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisation currently uses about 3,000 different “crawlers”, algorithms that take regular snapshots of certain public, paywall-free web pages that are stored in the Wayback Machine. Some are very specific, such as political websites from specific geographies, and some are much broader. Organisations can pay the archive to set up a specific crawler, which around 650 have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive itself, this partial copy of the internet, is stored in six 6ft-high servers that sit upstairs in what used to be the nave of the church. There is a full back-up copy elsewhere in California, and partial copies in Canada, the Netherlands and Alexandria, Egypt. This is precautionary, said Mr Kahle: remember the burning of the great Library of Alexandria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the sides of the room stand around 130 3ft porcelain figurines — replicas of every employee who has spent at least three years at the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, said Mr Macdonald, the Internet Archive is only a starting point. It’s “a series of beta tests for what could be done at scale if society really got into it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its San Francisco roots, Mr Kahle said the non-profit has little in common with modern-day Silicon Valley, where the wealth gap is enormous and a few executives control platforms used by billions. He hopes the “legacy of all this technology” is not that “we have fewer winners,” he said. “I like it when lots of people win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9eRLElSW1c&quot;&gt;“The cost of JavaScript”&lt;/a&gt; as presented by Addy Osmani at #PerfMatters Conference 2019.
&lt;p&gt;One large change to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4&quot;&gt;the cost of JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years has been an improvement in how fast browsers can parse and compile script. &lt;strong&gt;In 2019, the dominant costs of processing scripts are now download and CPU execution time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User interaction can be delayed if the browser’s main thread is busy executing JavaScript, so optimizing bottlenecks with script execution time and network can be impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;guidance&quot;&gt;Actionable high-level guidance &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#guidance&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for web developers? Parse &amp;amp; compile costs are &lt;strong&gt;no longer as slow&lt;/strong&gt; as we once thought. The three things to focus on for JavaScript bundles are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve download time&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your JavaScript bundles small, especially for mobile devices. Small bundles improve download speeds, lower memory usage, and reduce CPU costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid having just a single large bundle; if a bundle exceeds ~50–100 kB, split it up into separate smaller bundles. (With HTTP/2 multiplexing, multiple request and response messages can be in flight at the same time, reducing the overhead of additional requests.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On mobile you’ll want to ship much less especially because of network speeds, but also to keep plain memory usage low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve execution time&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/&quot;&gt;Long Tasks&lt;/a&gt; that can keep the main thread busy and can push out how soon pages are interactive. Post-download, script execution time is now a dominant cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid large inline scripts&lt;/strong&gt; (as they’re still parsed and compiled on the main thread). A good rule of thumb is: if the script is over 1 kB, avoid inlining it (also because 1 kB is when &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs&quot;&gt;code caching&lt;/a&gt; kicks in for external scripts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;download-execute&quot;&gt;Why does download and execution time matter? &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#download-execute&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important to optimize download and execution times? Download times are critical for low-end networks. Despite the growth in 4G (and even 5G) across the world, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType&quot;&gt;effective connection types&lt;/a&gt; remain inconsistent with many of us running into speeds that feel like 3G (or worse) when we’re on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript execution time is important for phones with slow CPUs. Due to differences in CPU, GPU, and thermal throttling, there are huge disparities between the performance of high-end and low-end phones. This matters for the performance of JavaScript, as execution is CPU-bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, of the total time a page spends loading in a browser like Chrome, anywhere up to 30% of that time can be spent in JavaScript execution. Below is a page load from a site with a pretty typical workload (Reddit.com) on a high-end desktop machine:&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/reddit-js-processing.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;JavaScript processing represents 10–30% of time spent in V8 during page load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile, it takes 3–4× longer for a median phone (Moto G4) to execute Reddit’s JavaScript compared to a high-end device (Pixel 3), and over 6× as long on a low-end device (the &amp;lt;$100 Alcatel 1X):&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/reddit-js-processing-devices.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;The cost of Reddit’s JavaScript across a few different device classes (low-end, average, and high-end)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Reddit has different experiences for desktop and mobile web, and so the MacBook Pro results cannot be compared to the other results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re trying to optimize JavaScript execution time, keep an eye out for &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/long-tasks-devtools/&quot;&gt;Long Tasks&lt;/a&gt; that might be monopolizing the UI thread for long periods of time. These can block critical tasks from executing even if the page looks visually ready. Break these up into smaller tasks. By splitting up your code and prioritizing the order in which it is loaded, you can get pages interactive faster and hopefully have lower input latency.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/long-tasks.png&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; srcset=&quot;/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/long-tasks@2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;Long tasks monopolize the main thread. You should break them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;v8-improvements&quot;&gt;What has V8 done to improve parse/compile? &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#v8-improvements&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw JavaScript parsing speed in V8 has increased 2× since Chrome 60. At the same time, raw parse (and compile) cost has become less visible/important due to other optimization work in Chrome that parallelizes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V8 has reduced the amount of parsing and compilation work on the main thread by an average of 40% (e.g. 46% on Facebook, 62% on Pinterest) with the highest improvement being 81% (YouTube), by parsing and compiling on a worker thread. This is in addition to the existing off-main-thread streaming parse/compile.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;836&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/chrome-js-parse-times.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;V8 parse times across different versions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also visualize the CPU time impact of these changes across different versions of V8 across Chrome releases. In the same amount of time it took Chrome 61 to parse Facebook’s JS, Chrome 75 can now parse both Facebook’s JS AND 6 times Twitter’s JS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/js-parse-times-websites.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;In the time it took Chrome 61 to parse Facebook’s JS, Chrome 75 can now parse both Facebook’s JS and 6 times Twitter’s JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into how these changes were unlocked. In short, script resources can be streaming-parsed and-compiled on a worker thread, meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;V8 can parse+compile JavaScript without blocking the main thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming starts once the full HTML parser encounters a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. For parser-blocking scripts, the HTML parser yields, while for async scripts it continues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For most real-world connection speeds, V8 parses faster than download, so V8 is done parsing+compiling a few milliseconds after the last script bytes are downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The not-so-short explanation is… Much older versions of Chrome would download a script in full before beginning to parse it, which is a straightforward approach but it doesn’t fully utilize the CPU. Between versions 41 and 68, Chrome started parsing async and deferred scripts on a separate thread as soon as the download begins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/script-streaming-1.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;Scripts arrive in multiple chunks. V8 starts streaming once it’s seen at least 30 kB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chrome 71, we moved to a task-based setup where the scheduler could parse multiple async/deferred scripts at once. The impact of this change was a ~20% reduction in main thread parse time, yielding an overall ~2% improvement in TTI/FID as measured on real-world websites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/script-streaming-2.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;Chrome 71 moved to a task-based setup where the scheduler could parse multiple async/deferred scripts at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chrome 72, we switched to using streaming as the main way to parse: now also regular synchronous scripts are parsed that way (not inline scripts though). We also stopped canceling task-based parsing if the main thread needs it, since that just unnecessarily duplicates any work already done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-75#script-streaming-directly-from-network&quot;&gt;Previous versions of Chrome&lt;/a&gt; supported streaming parsing and compilation where the script source data coming in from the network had to make its way to Chrome’s main thread before it would be forwarded to the streamer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This often resulted in the streaming parser waiting for data that arrived from the network already, but had not yet been forwarded to the streaming task as it was blocked by other work on the main thread (like HTML parsing, layout, or JavaScript execution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now experimenting with starting parsing on preload, and the main-thread-bounce was a blocker for this beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leszek Swirski’s BlinkOn presentation goes into more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video video-16:9&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1UJgiG4_NI&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1UJgiG4_NI&quot;&gt;“Parsing JavaScript in zero* time”&lt;/a&gt; as presented by Leszek Swirski at BlinkOn 10.

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=939275&quot;&gt;an issue in DevTools&lt;/a&gt; that rendered the entire parser task in a way that hints that it’s using CPU (full block). However, the parser blocks whenever it’s starved for data (that needs to go over the main thread). Since we moved from a single streamer thread to streaming tasks, this became really obvious. Here’s what you’d use to see in Chrome 69:&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;98&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/devtools-69.png&quot; width=&quot;931&quot; srcset=&quot;/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/devtools-69@2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;The DevTools issue that rendered the entire parser task in a way that hints that it’s using CPU (full block)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “parse script” task is shown to take 1.08 seconds. However, parsing JavaScript isn’t really that slow! Most of that time is spent doing nothing except waiting for data to go over the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome 76 paints a different picture:&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/devtools-76.png&quot; width=&quot;922&quot; srcset=&quot;/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/devtools-76@2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;In Chrome 76, parsing is broken up into multiple smaller streaming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the DevTools performance pane is great for getting a high-level overview of what’s happening on your page. For detailed V8-specific metrics such as JavaScript parse and compile times, we recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/docs/rcs&quot;&gt;using Chrome Tracing with Runtime Call Stats (RCS)&lt;/a&gt;. In RCS results, &lt;code&gt;Parse-Background&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Compile-Background&lt;/code&gt; tell you how much time was spent parsing and compiling JavaScript off the main thread, whereas &lt;code&gt;Parse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Compile&lt;/code&gt; captures the main thread metrics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;526&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/rcs.png&quot; width=&quot;848&quot; srcset=&quot;/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/rcs@2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;impact&quot;&gt;What is the real-world impact of these changes? &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#impact&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some examples of real-world sites and how script streaming applies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/reddit-main-thread.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;Main thread vs. worker thread time spent parsing and compiling Reddit’s JS on a MacBook Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit.com has several 100 kB+ bundles which are wrapped in outer functions causing lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/preparser&quot;&gt;lazy compilation&lt;/a&gt; on the main thread. In the above chart, the main thread time is all that really matters because keeping the main thread busy can delay interactivity. Reddit spends most of its time on the main thread with minimum usage of the Worker/Background thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d benefit from splitting up some of their larger bundles into smaller ones (e.g 50 kB each) without the wrapping to maximize parallelization — so that each bundle could be streaming-parsed + compiled separately and reduce main thread parse/compile during start-up.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/facebook-main-thread.svg&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot;/&gt;Main thread vs. worker thread time spent parsing and compiling Facebook’s JS on a MacBook Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also look at a site like Facebook.com. Facebook loads ~6MB of compressed JS across ~292 requests, some of it async, some preloaded, and some fetched with a lower priority. A lot of their scripts are very small and granular — this can help with overall parallelization on the Background/Worker thread as these smaller scripts can be streaming-parsed/compiled at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, you’re probably not Facebook and likely don’t have a long-lived app like Facebook or Gmail where this much script may be justifiable on desktop. However, in general, keep your bundles coarse and only load what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most JavaScript parsing and compilation work can happen in a streaming fashion on a background thread, some work still has to happen on the main thread. When the main thread is busy, the page can’t respond to user input. Do keep an eye on the impact both downloading and executing code has on your UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, not all JavaScript engines and browsers implement script streaming as a loading optimization. We still believe the overall guidance here leads to good user experiences across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;json&quot;&gt;The cost of parsing JSON &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#json&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the JSON grammar is much simpler than JavaScript’s grammar, JSON can be parsed more efficiently than JavaScript. This knowledge can be applied to improve start-up performance for web apps that ship large JSON-like configuration object literals (such as inline Redux stores). Instead of inlining the data as a JavaScript object literal, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; foo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; bar&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1337&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 🐌&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…it can be represented in JSON-stringified form, and then JSON-parsed at runtime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight-line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; data &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'{&quot;foo&quot;:42,&quot;bar&quot;:1337}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// 🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the JSON string is only evaluated once, the &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/code&gt; approach is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/json-parse-benchmark&quot;&gt;much faster&lt;/a&gt; compared to the JavaScript object literal, especially for cold loads. A good rule of thumb is to apply this technique for objects of 10 kB or larger — but as always with performance advice, measure the actual impact before making any changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/json.svg&quot; width=&quot;842&quot;/&gt;&lt;code&gt;JSON.parse('…')&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/json-parse-benchmark&quot;&gt;much faster&lt;/a&gt; to parse, compile, and execute compared to an equivalent JavaScript literal — not just in V8 (1.7× as fast), but in all major JavaScript engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/features/subsume-json#embedding-json-parse&quot;&gt;our &lt;em&gt;JSON ⊂ ECMAScript&lt;/em&gt; feature explainer&lt;/a&gt; for an example implementation that, given an arbitrary object, generates a valid JavaScript program that &lt;code&gt;JSON.parse&lt;/code&gt;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an additional risk when using plain object literals for large amounts of data: they could be parsed &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first pass happens when the literal gets preparsed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second pass happens when the literal gets lazy-parsed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first pass can’t be avoided. Luckily, the second pass can be avoided by placing the object literal at the top-level, or within a &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/preparser#pife&quot;&gt;PIFE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;repeat-visits&quot;&gt;What about parse/compile on repeat visits? &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#repeat-visits&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V8’s (byte)code-caching optimization can help. When a script is first requested, Chrome downloads it and gives it to V8 to compile. It also stores the file in the browser’s on-disk cache. When the JS file is requested a second time, Chrome takes the file from the browser cache and once again gives it to V8 to compile. This time, however, the compiled code is serialized, and is attached to the cached script file as metadata.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;774&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://v8.dev/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/code-caching.png&quot; width=&quot;1431&quot; srcset=&quot;/_img/cost-of-javascript-2019/code-caching@2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;Visualization of how code caching works in V8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third time, Chrome takes both the file and the file’s metadata from the cache, and hands both to V8. V8 deserializes the metadata and can skip compilation. Code caching kicks in if the first two visits happen within 72 hours. Chrome also has eager code caching if a service worker is used to cache scripts. You can read more about code caching in &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/code-caching-for-devs&quot;&gt;code caching for web developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions &lt;a href=&quot;https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#conclusions&quot; class=&quot;bookmark&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and execution time are the primary bottlenecks for loading scripts in 2019. Aim for a small bundle of synchronous (inline) scripts for your above-the-fold content with one or more deferred scripts for the rest of the page. Break down your large bundles so you focus on only shipping code the user needs when they need it. This maximizes parallelization in V8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mobile, you’ll want to ship a lot less script because of network, memory consumption and execution time for slower CPUs. Balance latency with cacheability to maximize the amount of parsing and compilation work that can happen off the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AirSim: open-source simulator for autonomous vehicles</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unrealengine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt; (we now also have an experimental &lt;a href=&quot;https://unity3d.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports hardware-in-loop with popular flight controllers such as PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment. Similarly, we have an experimental release for a Unity plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to develop AirSim as a platform for AI research to experiment with deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, AirSim also exposes APIs to retrieve data and control vehicles in a platform independent way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Use It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View our &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;detailed documentation&lt;/a&gt; on all aspects of AirSim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manual drive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have remote control (RC) as shown below, you can manually control the drone in the simulator. For cars, you can use arrow keys to drive manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/remote_control/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/images/AirSimDroneManual.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/raw/master/docs/images/AirSimDroneManual.gif&quot; alt=&quot;record screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/images/AirSimCarManual.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/raw/master/docs/images/AirSimCarManual.gif&quot; alt=&quot;record screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Programmatic control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AirSim exposes APIs so you can interact with the vehicle in the simulation programmatically. You can use these APIs to retrieve images, get state, control the vehicle and so on. The APIs are exposed through the RPC, and are accessible via a variety of languages, including C++, Python, C# and Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These APIs are also available as part of a separate, independent cross-platform library, so you can deploy them on a companion computer on your vehicle. This way you can write and test your code in the simulator, and later execute it on the real vehicles. Transfer learning and related research is one of our focus areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/settings#simmode&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SimMode setting&lt;/a&gt; to specify the default vehicle or the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/image_apis#computer-vision-mode-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ComputerVision mode&lt;/a&gt; so you don't get prompted each time you start AirSim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/apis/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gathering training data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you can generate training data from AirSim for deep learning. The easiest way is to simply press the record button in the lower right corner. This will start writing pose and images for each frame. The data logging code is pretty simple and you can modify it to your heart's content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/images/record_data.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/raw/master/docs/images/record_data.png&quot; alt=&quot;record screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better way to generate training data exactly the way you want is by accessing the APIs. This allows you to be in full control of how, what, where and when you want to log data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Computer Vision mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another way to use AirSim is the so-called &quot;Computer Vision&quot; mode. In this mode, you don't have vehicles or physics. You can use the keyboard to move around the scene, or use APIs to position available cameras in any arbitrary pose, and collect images such as depth, disparity, surface normals or object segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/image_apis/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;More details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Weather Effects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press F10 to see various options available for weather effects. You can also control the weather using &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/apis#weather-apis&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Press F1 to see other options available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body toptext graph2&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, suddenly, the account began posting, in &lt;span class=&quot;cnhighlight&quot;&gt;Chinese&lt;/span&gt;, about a different obsession: politics in Hong Kong and mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body toptext graph3&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;By this summer, it had become a foot soldier in a covert campaign to shape people’s views about one of the world’s biggest political crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;The account, @HKpoliticalnew, and more than 200,000 other Twitter accounts were part of a sprawling Russian-style disinformation offensive from China, Twitter now says, the first time an American technology giant has attributed such a campaign to the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;China has long deployed propaganda and censorship to subject its citizens to government-approved narratives. As the nation’s place in the world grows, Beijing has increasingly turned to internet platforms that it blocks within the country — including Twitter and Facebook — to advance its agenda across the rest of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;It has done so in part by setting up accounts on the platforms for its state-run news outlets, such as China Daily, to make a public case for its views. But that is quite different from using fake accounts to manipulate opinions surreptitiously or simply to sow confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;“The end goal is to control the conversation,” said Matt Schrader, a China analyst with the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Twitter last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/hong-kong-protests-china-disinformation-facebook-twitter.html&quot;&gt;took down nearly 1,000 accounts&lt;/a&gt; that it said were part of a state-directed effort to undermine the antigovernment protests in Hong Kong. It also suspended 200,000 other accounts that it said were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/hong-kong-protests-china-disinformation-facebook-twitter.html&quot;&gt;connected to the Chinese operation&lt;/a&gt; but not yet very active. Facebook and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/technology/youtube-hong-kong-protests-china-disinformation.html&quot;&gt;YouTube quickly followed suit&lt;/a&gt;. All three platforms are blocked in mainland China but not in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 3.6 million tweets that the accounts sent represented a campaign that was less sophisticated and more hastily assembled than the one Russia carried out during the 2016 United States presidential election, researchers at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspi.org.au/report/tweeting-through-great-firewall&quot;&gt;a report published this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead of taking the time to cultivate plausible yet fake online personalities, the campaign’s operators appear to have simply bought accounts in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;shadowy global marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for social media influence, where followers and retweets can be had for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;The accounts posted in Indonesian, Arabic, Portuguese and other languages. They promoted hookup services, posted about Korean boy bands and retweeted messages about pop-punk music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;“As a Hong Kong person who loves Hong Kong, I really miss the Hong Kong of before, which was developed and ruled by law,” @derrickmcnabbx wrote in Chinese on June 15. The account’s location was described as “Georgia, USA.” Before this year, nearly all of its tweets were links to pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;The “blunt-force” approach, the authors of the Australian report wrote, suggested that the operation was likely to have been a “rapid response to the unanticipated size and power of the Hong Kong protests rather than a campaign planned well in advance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said he had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/jzhsl_673025/t1690222.shtml&quot;&gt;no knowledge of the matter&lt;/a&gt; when asked last month whether the government was behind the accounts that Twitter and Facebook took down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;In its announcement, Twitter said little about how it determined that the accounts it removed were state directed. The company said it routinely monitored for such campaigns but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Chinese government blocks Twitter’s service in mainland China, and yet some of the accounts were operated &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information_operations_directed_at_Hong_Kong.html&quot;&gt;from unblocked Chinese internet addresses&lt;/a&gt;, the company said. Some of the activity was traced to addresses in Beijing, according to a person familiar with Twitter’s investigation who feared retaliation from the government and requested anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are already some signs that Twitter has not halted the Chinese campaign entirely. Nick Monaco of Institute for the Future, a think tank in Palo Alto, Calif., identified &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nickmonaco/6d48ee186939&quot;&gt;17 accounts&lt;/a&gt; that had strong similarities to those that Twitter took down but which remained active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some of the accounts tweeted messages that matched, word for word, ones that Twitter had deleted. They used the same third-party software as many of the accounts Twitter had removed to post messages with similar themes, in what seemed to be a coordinated manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;After The New York Times presented Mr. Monaco’s findings to Twitter last week, the company shut the accounts down but declined to say conclusively whether they had been part of the same state-backed network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many of the accounts originally identified by Twitter had spread pro-government messages during other public-relations crises for Beijing. Large numbers of such messages began appearing in 2017, after the exiled businessman Guo Wengui began &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/world/asia/china-guo-wengui.html&quot;&gt;accusing senior Chinese leaders of graft&lt;/a&gt;, which raises the question of why Twitter did not remove the accounts sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-asset g-graphic&quot; id=&quot;bigtimeline&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;g-caption_heading g-has-leadin&quot;&gt;The closed accounts also targeted Chinese dissidents&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;g-asset-leadin g-caption&quot;&gt;Before the accounts focused on the Hong Kong protests, they smeared critics of the Chinese government, according to analyses by The Times and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The favorite target was &lt;span class=&quot;gwg&quot;&gt;Guo Wengui&lt;/span&gt;, a real estate developer who fled to the United States and accused top Chinese officials of corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai4-2&quot; class=&quot;g-dotnotes g-aiAbs&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;yjl&quot;&gt;Yang Jianli&lt;/span&gt;, an outspoken critic of the Chinese government, was accused of being a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gmh&quot;&gt;Gui Minhai&lt;/span&gt;, a Hong Kong bookseller who disappeared then resurfaced in police custody in China, was also targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai4-7&quot; class=&quot;g-dotnotes g-aiAbs&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign targeting Guo Wengui extended into 2018 and 2019, before the focus shifted to Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai4-10&quot; class=&quot;g-dotnotes g-aiAbs&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early tweets related to the ongoing &lt;span class=&quot;hk&quot;&gt;Hong Kong crisis&lt;/span&gt; appeared in February, when the government proposed the extradition bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;g-ai4-12&quot; class=&quot;g-dotnotes g-aiAbs&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweets about the Hong Kong protests and the extradition bill exploded after June 9, the day of the first big demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;During some of their tweet campaigns, the accounts posted primarily during the workweek, a sign that the accounts were run by employees working on the clock. For months, one account posted messages smearing Mr. Guo at 12 and 42 minutes past the hour, suggesting that the activity was automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some of the accounts appear to have been started by genuine users but were later hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first four years of posts on one account, @emiliya_naum, read like those of an ordinary American teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;She tweeted longingly at @justinbieber and said she twerked in her room to celebrate Barack Obama’s 2012 election victory. She cataloged her moods and mused about her crushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;“The guy I like and my best friend hate each other … #ThisIsntGood,” she wrote in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, like many Twitter users, she let her account fall silent — until this summer, when she re-emerged as a cheerleader for Hong Kong law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Hong Kong police, way to go, we support you!” she tweeted, in Chinese. “We understand your hardships!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;It could not be determined whether @emiliya_naum was originally operated by a real person. No accounts with that name were found on Facebook, Instagram or other major social platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;By and large, the accounts that Twitter took down struggled to go viral with their pro-Beijing messages. Many of their most retweeted posts were links to pornography and animal videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Elise Thomas, one of the authors of the Australian report, said that the low level of professionalism suggested that the campaign was not the work of the People’s Liberation Army or the Ministry of State Security, which have previously been linked to Chinese cyberespionage and information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I would be surprised if the P.L.A. was responsible because I would expect they would be more competent than this,” Ms. Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Russia’s social media efforts ahead of the 2016 presidential election were cannier about finding and influencing audiences in the United States. The Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/world/europe/russia-troll-factory.html&quot;&gt;company with Kremlin ties&lt;/a&gt;, tailored its trolling operations to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/us/politics/takeaways-russia-social-media-operations.html&quot;&gt;sow maximum discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Titus C. Chen, a professor who studies Chinese social media at the National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan, said he believed that China had created its own analogues to the Internet Research Agency, though they operated far less openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Turning spam bots into propaganda mouthpieces would represent a natural evolution of techniques that Beijing has long used at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;For years, China has used armies of pseudonymous keyboard warriors to flood domestic social platforms and news sites with pro-government comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 2013, the head of China’s propaganda department said that in Beijing alone, there were &lt;a href=&quot;http://city.sina.com.cn/focus/t/2013-01-23/105735050.html&quot;&gt;more than two million people&lt;/a&gt; working to “strengthen guidance of online opinion,” including by posting comments on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;Samm Sacks, a China expert at New America, a Washington-based think tank, said the clumsiness of the Twitter operations showed that China was still “out of its depth in trying to shape the international narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot; id=&quot;&quot;&gt;“What works inside China doesn’t work internationally,” she said. “I think China is probably working through that now.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New Query Language for Graph Databases to Become International Standard</title>
<link>https://neo4j.com/press-releases/query-language-graph-databases-international-standard/?</link>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Neo4j Backs Launch of GQL Project: First New ISO Database Language Since SQL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN MATEO, Calif. – September 17, 2019  – &lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/?ref=pr-&quot;&gt;Neo4j&lt;/a&gt;, the leader in graph databases, announced today that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iso.org/isoiec-jtc-1.html&quot;&gt;international committees that develop the SQL standard&lt;/a&gt; have voted to initiate GQL (Graph Query Language) as a new database query language. Now to be codified as the international standard declarative query language for property graphs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://neo4j.com/blog/gql-standard-query-language-property-graphs/?ref=pr-&quot;&gt;GQL represents the culmination of years of effort by Neo4j&lt;/a&gt; and the broader database community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20190916143323/GQL-ecosystem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Neo4j News: GQL to incorporate and consider several graph database languages&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-104755&quot; srcset=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20190916143323/GQL-ecosystem.jpg 1001w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20190916143323/GQL-ecosystem-150x90.jpg 150w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20190916143323/GQL-ecosystem-300x180.jpg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20190916143323/GQL-ecosystem-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20190916143323/GQL-ecosystem-600x360.jpg 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;English: GQL to incorporate and consider several graph database languages.&lt;br/&gt;Cypher: &lt;span&gt;(:Neo4j)-[:BACKS]-&amp;gt;(GQL:Project)&amp;lt;-[:STARTED]-(:ISO)-[:STANDARDIZED]-&amp;gt;(SQL:Project)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiative for GQL was first advanced in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gql.today/?ref=pr-&quot;&gt;GQL Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; in May 2018. A year later, the project was considered at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gqlstandards.org/gql-blogs/critical-milestone-for-iso-graph-query-standard-gql?ref=pr-&quot;&gt;an international gathering in June&lt;/a&gt;. Ten countries including the United States, Germany, UK, Korea, and China have now voted in favor, with seven countries promising active participation by national experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been well over 30 years since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iso.org/isoiec-jtc-1.html&quot;&gt;ISO/IEC&lt;/a&gt; began the SQL project. SQL went on to become the dominant language for accessing relational data, achieving wide adoption by vendors and practitioners and dramatically accelerating the growth of the relational database market. The GQL project will initiate development of the next generation of technology standards for accessing data, optimized for today’s world of connected data. Its charter mandates building on core foundations already established by SQL, as well as ongoing collaboration to ensure SQL and GQL compatibility and interoperability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Plantikow, Product Manager and Standards Engineer for Property Graph Querying at Neo4j, serves as a GQL project lead and editor of the planned GQL specification. He has many years of experience developing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencypher.org/?ref=pr-&quot;&gt;Cypher language&lt;/a&gt;, a key source for GQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe now is the perfect time for the industry to come together and define the next generation graph query language standard,” said Plantikow. “It’s great to receive formal recognition of the need for a standard language. Building upon a decade of experience with property graph querying, GQL will support native graph data types and structures, its own graph schema, a pattern-based approach to data querying, insertion and manipulation, and the ability to create new graphs, and graph views, as well as generate tabular and nested data. Our intent is to respect, evolve, and integrate key concepts from several existing languages including graph extensions to SQL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GQL reflects fast growth in the graph database market, demonstrated by increasing adoption of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencypher.org/projects?ref=pr-&quot;&gt;Cypher language&lt;/a&gt;, which has shown potential and powered the demand for a single, standard language to play the role of SQL for graph databases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Neo4j, many companies are already taking part in GQL-related activities including Redis Labs, SAP and IBM. National experts from China, Korea are joining existing participants centred in Europe and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Hare, who has been active in the SQL Standards process since 1988 and has served as the chair of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iso.org/committee/45342.html&quot;&gt;international SQL standards committee for database languages&lt;/a&gt; since 2005, charted the progress toward GQL. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have reached a balance of initiating GQL, the database query language of the future whilst preserving the value and ubiquity of SQL,” said Hare. “Our committee has been heartened to see strong international community participation to usher in the GQL project.  Such support is the mark of an emerging de jure and de facto standard .”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Too Many Video Streaming Choices May Drive Users Back To Piracy</title>
<link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190320/07442041832/ironically-too-many-video-streaming-choices-may-drive-users-back-to-piracy.shtml</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190320/07442041832/ironically-too-many-video-streaming-choices-may-drive-users-back-to-piracy.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;adapt-or-perish&lt;/em&gt; dept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be very clear the rise in streaming video competitors is a very good thing. It's providing users with more choice, lower prices, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180523/11011439893/shockingly-streaming-providers-are-dominating-cable-customer-satisfaction.shtml&quot;&gt;better customer service&lt;/a&gt; than consumers traditionally received from entrenched vanilla cable TV companies. It's the perfect example of how disruption and innovation are supposed to work. And given the abysmal customer satisfaction ratings of most big cable TV providers, this was an industry that's been absolutely begging for a disruptive kick in the ass since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181018/08242940864/streaming-exclusives-will-drive-users-back-to-piracy-industry-is-largely-oblivious.shtml&quot;&gt;also noted&lt;/a&gt; that, ironically, the glut of video choices--more specifically the glut of streaming exclusivity silos--risks driving users back to piracy. Studies predict that every broadcaster and their uncle will have launched their own direct-to-consumer streaming platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Study-Every-Broadcaster-Will-Offer-a-Streaming-Service-by-2022-141445&quot;&gt;by 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these companies are understandably keen on locking their own content behind exclusivity paywalls, whether that's HBO Now's &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, or CBS All Access's &lt;em&gt;Stark Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as consumers are forced to pay for more and more subscriptions to get all of the content they're looking for, they're not only getting frustrated by the growing costs (defeating the whole point of cutting the cord), they're frustrated by the experience of having to hunt and peck through an endlessly shifting sea of exclusivity arrangements and licensing deals that make it difficult to track where your favorite show or film resides this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, there's some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180926/10321340720/thanks-to-streaming-fragmentation-bittorrent-traffic-is-suddenly-rising-traffic-share.shtml&quot;&gt;early anecdotal data&lt;/a&gt; to suggest this is already happening. But because these companies are fixated on building market share, and this will likely be an industry-wide issue, most aren't seeing the problem yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are. The 13th edition of Deloitte’s annual Digital Media Trends survey makes it clear that &lt;em&gt;too many options&lt;/em&gt; and shifting exclusivity arrangements are &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/streaming-subscription-fatigue-us-consumers-deloitte-study-1203166046/&quot;&gt;increasingly annoying paying customers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the plethora of options has a downside: Nearly half (47%) of U.S. consumers say they’re frustrated by the growing number of subscriptions and services required to watch what they want, according to the 13th edition of Deloitte’s annual Digital Media Trends survey. An even bigger pet peeve: 57% said they’re frustrated when content vanishes because rights to their favorite TV shows or movies have expired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Consumers want choice — but only up to a point,” said Kevin Westcott, Deloitte vice chairman and U.S. telecom and media and entertainment leader, who oversees the study. “We may be entering a time of ‘subscription fatigue.'”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, people don't like Comcast, but they do ironically want a little more centralization than they're seeing in the streaming space. What that looks like isn't clear yet, but it's something that will slowly get built as some of the &lt;strong&gt;300&lt;/strong&gt; options (and growing) currently available fail to gain traction in the space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All told, there are more than 300 over-the-top video options in the U.S. With that fragmentation, there’s a clear opportunity for larger platforms to reaggregate these services in a way that can provide access across all sources and make recommendations based on all of someone’s interests, Westcott said. “Consumers are looking for less friction in the consumption process,” he said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variety's otherwise excellent report doesn't mention this, but a lot of these customers are going to revert to piracy. It's not clear why this isn't mentioned, but it's kind of standard practice for larger outlets to avoid mentioning piracy in the odd belief that acknowledging it somehow condones it. But if you don't mention it, you don't learn from it. You don't understand that piracy is best seen as just another competitor, and a useful tool to gain insight into what customers (studies repeatedly show pirates &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evkmz7/study-again-shows-pirates-tend-to-be-the-biggest-buyers-of-legal-content&quot;&gt;buy more content than most anybody else&lt;/a&gt;) really want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to dismiss this as privileged whining (&quot;poor baby is upset because they have &lt;em&gt;too many choices&lt;/em&gt;), and that's certainly what a big segment of the market is going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would be a mistake to ignore consumer frustration and the obviously annoying rise of endless exclusivity silos, given the effort it took to migrate users away from piracy and toward legitimate services in the first place. The primary lesson learned during that experience is you &lt;em&gt;need to compete with piracy&lt;/em&gt;. It's not really a choice. It's real, it's impossible to stop, and the best way to mitigate it is to listen to your customers. Building more walled gardens, raising rates, and ignoring what subscribers want is the precise opposite of that.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Colorado Town Offers 1 Gbps for $60 After Years of Battling Comcast</title>
<link>https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190904/08392642916/colorado-town-offers-1-gbps-60-after-years-battling-comcast.shtml</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190904/08392642916/colorado-town-offers-1-gbps-60-after-years-battling-comcast.shtml</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;build-it-and-they-will-come&lt;/em&gt; dept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new community broadband network went live in Fort Collins, Colorado recently offering locals there gigabit fiber speeds for $60 a month with no caps, restrictions, or hidden fees. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcgov.com/news/index.php?id=7551&quot;&gt;network launch&lt;/a&gt; comes years after telecom giants like Comcast worked tirelessly to crush the effort. Voters approved the effort as part of a November 2017 ballot initiative, despite the telecom industry spending nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180104/09234138930/colorado-cities-keep-voting-to-build-their-own-broadband-networks.shtml&quot;&gt;$1 million on misleading ads&lt;/a&gt; to try and derail the effort. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://muninetworks.org/sites/www.muninetworks.org/files/2017-11-comcast-fort-collins-seattle-competition-policy-brief.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) by the Institute for Local Reliance estimated that actual competition in the town was likely to cost Comcast between $5.4 million and $22.8 million each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike private operations, the Fort Collins Connexion network pledges to adhere to net neutrality. The folks behind the network &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/comcast-beware-new-city-run-broadband-offers-1gbps-for-60-a-month/&quot;&gt;told Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt; the goal is to offer faster broadband to the lion's share of the city within the next few years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The initial number of homes we're targeting this week is 20-30. We will notify new homes weekly, slowly ramping up in volume,&quot; Connexion spokesperson Erin Shanley told Ars. While Connexion's fiber lines currently pass just a small percentage of the city's homes and businesses, Shanley said the city's plan is to build out to the city limits within two or three years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Ideally we will capture more than 50% of the market share, similar to Longmont,&quot; another Colorado city that built its own network, Shanley said. Beta testers at seven homes are already using the Fort Collins service, and the plan is to start notifying potential customers about service availability today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telecom sector simply loves trying to insist that community-run broadband is an inevitable taxpayer boondoggle. But such efforts are just like any other proposal and depend greatly on the quality of the business plan. And the industry likes to ignore the fact that such efforts would not be happening in the first place if American consumers weren't outraged by the high prices, slow speeds, and terrible customer service the industry is known for. All symptoms of the limited competition industry apologists are usually very quick to pretend aren't real problems (because when quarterly returns are all that matter to you, they aren't).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years we've noted how large ISPs like Comcast quite literally write and buy protectionist state laws preventing towns and cities from building their own broadband networks (or striking public/private partnerships). These ISPs don't want to spend money to improve or expand service into lower ROI areas, but they don't want towns and cities to either -- since many of these networks operate on an open access model encouraging a little something known as competition. As such it's much cheaper to buy a state law and a lawmaker who'll support it -- than to actually try and give a damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while roughly nineteen states have passed such laws, Colorado's SB 152, co-crafted by Comcast and Centurylink in 2005, was notably unique in that it let local towns and cities hold local referendums on whether they'd like to ignore it. And over the last few years, an overwhelming number of Colorado towns and cities have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180404/09525339561/more-colorado-towns-vote-down-comcast-state-law-hamstringing-broadband-competition.shtml&quot;&gt;voted to do so&lt;/a&gt;, preferring to decide local infrastructure issues for themselves instead of having lobbyists for Comcast dictate what they can or can't do in their own communities, with their own tax dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's probably not a day that goes by without these companies regretting letting that caveat make it into the final bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 1989 a set of new internet domains was created in Europe, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.pl&quot; title=&quot;.pl&quot;&gt;.pl&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland&quot; title=&quot;Poland&quot;&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.cs&quot; title=&quot;.cs&quot;&gt;.cs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia&quot; title=&quot;Czechoslovakia&quot;&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.yu&quot; title=&quot;.yu&quot;&gt;.yu&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia&quot; title=&quot;Yugoslavia&quot;&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dd&quot; title=&quot;.dd&quot;&gt;.dd&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany&quot; title=&quot;East Germany&quot;&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;). Among them there was also a domain for the USSR – .su.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-rosyjski_3-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-rosyjski-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Initially, before two-letter ccTLDs became standard, the Soviet Union was to receive a .ussr domain. The .su domain was proposed by the then-19-year-old Finnish student Petri Ojala.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-netoscop_4-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-netoscop-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On 26 December 1991 the country &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union&quot; title=&quot;Dissolution of the Soviet Union&quot;&gt;formally ceased to exist&lt;/a&gt; and its constituent republics gained independence, which should have caused the domain to begin a phase-out process, as happened with those of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Until 1993&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-rosyjski_3-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-rosyjski-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; there was no assigned top-level domain name for Russia. For this reason the country continued to use the Soviet domain. In 1993 the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ru&quot; title=&quot;.ru&quot;&gt;.ru&lt;/a&gt; domain was created, which is supposed to eventually replace the .su domain&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-rosyjski_3-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-rosyjski-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (domains for the republics other than Russia were created at different times in the mid-nineties; however, the domain usage outside the Russian region is slim). The domain was supposed to be withdrawn by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN&quot; title=&quot;ICANN&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;, but it was kept at the request of the Russian government and Internet users.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-rosyjski_3-3&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-rosyjski-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, the managers of the domain stated that they would commence accepting new .su registrations, but it is unclear whether this action was compatible with ICANN policies. ICANN has expressed intentions to terminate the .su domain and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority&quot; title=&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority&quot;&gt;IANA&lt;/a&gt; states that the domain is being phased out,&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-5&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but lobbyists stated in September 2007 that they had started negotiations with ICANN on retaining the domain.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-6&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the first quarter of 2008, .su registrations increased by 45%.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-7&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Usage&quot;&gt;Usage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain was intended to be used by Soviet institutions and companies operating in the USSR. Despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the superseding of the TLD by the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_TLDs&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Country TLDs&quot;&gt;country TLDs&lt;/a&gt; of the republics that gained independence, it is still in use as of 2019. Most of the .su domains are registered in Russia and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States&quot; title=&quot;United States&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-gazeta_8-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-gazeta-8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; According to the &lt;i&gt;RU-CENTER&lt;/i&gt; data from May 2010, there were over 93,500 registered domains with the .su TLD (there are over 2.8 million .ru domains).&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-stat.nic_9-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-stat.nic-9&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Among the institutions still using this domain is the Russian pro-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin&quot; title=&quot;Vladimir Putin&quot;&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; youth movement &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashi_(youth_movement)&quot; title=&quot;Nashi (youth movement)&quot;&gt;Nashi&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-nashi_10-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-nashi-10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as well as by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya_(confederation)&quot; title=&quot;Novorossiya (confederation)&quot;&gt;pro-Russian armed insurgency&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Ukraine.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-11&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-11&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Some organizations with roots in the former Soviet Union also still use this TLD.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-12&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-12&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domain has been reported to host many &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime&quot; title=&quot;Cybercrime&quot;&gt;cybercrime&lt;/a&gt; activities due to the lax, outdated terms of use, and staying out of focus (2% usage comparing to the primary .ru zone).&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-13&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-13&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-group-ib.com_14-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-group-ib.com-14&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Rules for timely suspension of malicious domains&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-group-ib.com_14-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-group-ib.com-14&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have been in place since 2013.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-15&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su#cite_note-15&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
