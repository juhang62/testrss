<description>&lt;p&gt;Re: GDPR, I mean creators, not Brave users. If a domain owner, channel owner, or similar sends you a RTBF request, can those assigned donations be reverted and the records of which domain/channel/other personal identifier they were assigned to be removed?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Electron 4.0.0</title>
<link>https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;blog-byline mt-2 mb-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BinaryMuse&quot; class=&quot;author-link ml-3&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/BinaryMuse.png?size=36&quot; alt=&quot;BinaryMuse&quot; class=&quot;avatar mr-2&quot;/&gt;BinaryMuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electron team is excited to announce that the stable release of Electron 4 is now available! You can install it from &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;electronjs.org&lt;/a&gt; or from npm via &lt;code&gt;npm install electron@latest&lt;/code&gt;. The release is packed with upgrades, fixes, and new features, and we can't wait to see what you build with them. Read more for details about this release, and please share any feedback you have as you explore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of Electron's functionality is provided by Chromium, Node.js, and V8, the core components that make up Electron. As such, a key goal for the Electron team is to keep up with changes to these projects as much as possible, providing developers who build Electron apps access to new web and JavaScript features. To this end, Electron 4 features major version bumps to each of these components; Electron v4.0.0 includes Chromium &lt;code&gt;69.0.3497.106&lt;/code&gt;, Node &lt;code&gt;10.11.0&lt;/code&gt;, and V8 &lt;code&gt;6.9.427.24&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Electron 4 includes changes to Electron-specific APIs. You can find a summary of the major changes in Electron 4 below; for the full list of changes, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v4.0.0&quot;&gt;Electron v4.0.0 release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;disabling-the-remote-module&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#disabling-the-remote-module&quot;&gt;Disabling the &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt; Module&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have the ability to disable the &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt; module for security reasons. The module can be disabled for &lt;code&gt;BrowserWindow&lt;/code&gt;s and for &lt;code&gt;webview&lt;/code&gt; tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; BrowserWindow({
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;webPreferences&lt;/span&gt;: {
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;enableRemoteModule&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  }
})


&amp;lt;webview src=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt; enableremotemodule=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;false&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;webview&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window&quot;&gt;BrowserWindow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/webview-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;webview&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Tag&lt;/a&gt; documentation for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;filtering-remoterequire--remotegetglobal-requests&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#filtering-remoterequire--remotegetglobal-requests&quot;&gt;Filtering &lt;code&gt;remote.require()&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;remote.getGlobal()&lt;/code&gt; Requests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature is useful if you don't want to completely disable the &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt; module in your renderer process or &lt;code&gt;webview&lt;/code&gt; but would like additional control over which modules can be required via &lt;code&gt;remote.require&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a module is required via &lt;code&gt;remote.require&lt;/code&gt; in a renderer process, a &lt;code&gt;remote-require&lt;/code&gt; event is raised on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/app&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; module&lt;/a&gt;. You can call &lt;code&gt;event.preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; on the the event (the first argument) to prevent the module from being loaded. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebContents&lt;/code&gt; instance&lt;/a&gt; where the require occurred is passed as the second argument, and the name of the module is passed as the third argument. The same event is also emitted on the &lt;code&gt;WebContents&lt;/code&gt; instance, but in this case the only arguments are the event and the module name. In both cases, you can return a custom value by setting the value of &lt;code&gt;event.returnValue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;
app.on(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'remote-require'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;event, webContents, requestedModuleName&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;{
  
})


browserWin.webContents.on(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'remote-require'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;event, requestedModuleName&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;{
  
})&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion, when &lt;code&gt;remote.getGlobal(name)&lt;/code&gt; is called, a &lt;code&gt;remote-get-global&lt;/code&gt; event is raised. This works the same way as the &lt;code&gt;remote-require&lt;/code&gt; event: call &lt;code&gt;preventDefault()&lt;/code&gt; to prevent the global from being returned, and set &lt;code&gt;event.returnValue&lt;/code&gt; to return a custom value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;
app.on(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'remote-get-global'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;event, webContents, requrestedGlobalName&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;{
  
})


browserWin.webContents.on(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;'remote-get-global'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;event, requestedGlobalName&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;{
  
})&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the following documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;javascript-access-to-the-about-panel&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#javascript-access-to-the-about-panel&quot;&gt;JavaScript Access to the About Panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On macOS, you can now call &lt;code&gt;app.showAboutPanel()&lt;/code&gt; to programmatically show the About panel, just like clicking the menu item created via &lt;code&gt;{role: 'about'}&lt;/code&gt;. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/app?query=show#appshowaboutpanel-macos&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;showAboutPanel&lt;/code&gt; documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;controlling-webcontents-background-throttling&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#controlling-webcontents-background-throttling&quot;&gt;Controlling &lt;code&gt;WebContents&lt;/code&gt; Background Throttling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebContents&lt;/code&gt; instances now have a method &lt;code&gt;setBackgroundThrottling(allowed)&lt;/code&gt; to enable or disable throttling of timers and animations when the page is backgrounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; win = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; BrowserWindow(...)
win.webContents.setBackgroundThrottling(enableBackgroundThrottling)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents#contentssetbackgroundthrottlingallowed&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;setBackgroundThrottling&lt;/code&gt; documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-more-macos-109-support&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#no-more-macos-109-support&quot;&gt;No More macOS 10.9 Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromium no longer supports macOS 10.9 (OS X Mavericks), and as a result &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/15357&quot;&gt;Electron 4.0 and beyond does not support it either&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;single-instance-locking&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#single-instance-locking&quot;&gt;Single Instance Locking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, to make your app a Single Instance Application (ensuring that only one instance of your app is running at any given time), you could use the &lt;code&gt;app.makeSingleInstance()&lt;/code&gt; method. Starting in Electron 4.0, you must use &lt;code&gt;app.requestSingleInstanceLock()&lt;/code&gt; instead. The return value of this method indicates whether or not this instance of your application successfully obtained the lock. If it failed to obtain the lock, you can assume that another instance of your application is already running with the lock and exit immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of using &lt;code&gt;requestSingleInstanceLock()&lt;/code&gt; and information on nuanced behavior on various platforms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/app#apprequestsingleinstancelock&quot;&gt;see the documentation for &lt;code&gt;app.requestSingleInstanceLock()&lt;/code&gt; and related methods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/app#event-second-instance&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;second-instance&lt;/code&gt; event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;win_delay_load_hook&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#win_delay_load_hook&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;win_delay_load_hook&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building native modules for windows, the &lt;code&gt;win_delay_load_hook&lt;/code&gt; variable in the module's &lt;code&gt;binding.gyp&lt;/code&gt; must be true (which is the default). If this hook is not present, then the native module will fail to load on Windows, with an error message like &lt;code&gt;Cannot find module&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules#a-note-about-win_delay_load_hook&quot;&gt;See the native module guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following breaking changes are planned for Electron 5.0, and thus are deprecated in Electron 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;nodejs-integration-disabled-for-nativewindowopen-ed-windows&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#nodejs-integration-disabled-for-nativewindowopen-ed-windows&quot;&gt;Node.js Integration Disabled for &lt;code&gt;nativeWindowOpen&lt;/code&gt;-ed Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in Electron 5.0, child windows opened with the &lt;code&gt;nativeWindowOpen&lt;/code&gt; option will always have Node.js integration disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;webpreferences-default-values&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#webpreferences-default-values&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;webPreferences&lt;/code&gt; Default Values&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a new &lt;code&gt;BrowerWindow&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;webPreferences&lt;/code&gt; option set, the following &lt;code&gt;webPreferences&lt;/code&gt; option defaults are deprecated in favor of new defaults listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;table table-ruled table-full-width&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Property&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Deprecated Default&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;New Default&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;contextIsolation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;nodeIntegration&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;webviewTag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;value of &lt;code&gt;nodeIntegration&lt;/code&gt; if set, otherwise &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: there is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/9736&quot;&gt;a known bug (#9736)&lt;/a&gt; that prevents the &lt;code&gt;webview&lt;/code&gt; tag from working if &lt;code&gt;contextIsolation&lt;/code&gt; is on. Keep an eye on the GitHub issue for up-to-date information!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about context isolation, Node integration, and the &lt;code&gt;webview&lt;/code&gt; tag in &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security&quot;&gt;the Electron security document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron 4.0 will still use the current defaults, but if you don't pass an explicit value for them, you'll see a deprecation warning. To prepare your app for Electron 5.0, use explicit values for these options. &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window#new-browserwindowoptions&quot;&gt;See the &lt;code&gt;BrowserWindow&lt;/code&gt; docs&lt;/a&gt; for details on each of these options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;webcontentsfindinpagetext-options&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#webcontentsfindinpagetext-options&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;webContents.findInPage(text[, options])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;medialCapitalAsWordStart&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wordStart&lt;/code&gt; options have been deprecated as they have been removed upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program&quot;&gt;App Feedback Program&lt;/a&gt; we instituted during the development of Electron 3.0 was successful, so we've continued it during the development of 4.0 as well. We'd like to extend a massive thank you to Atlassian, Discord, MS Teams, OpenFin, Slack, Symphony, WhatsApp, and the other program members for their involvement during the 4.0 beta cycle. To learn more about the App Feedback Program and to participate in future betas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program&quot;&gt;check out our blog post about the program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8. Although we are careful not to make promises about release dates, our plan is release new major versions of Electron with new versions of those components approximately quarterly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning&quot;&gt;See our versioning document&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed information about versioning in Electron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information on planned breaking changes in upcoming versions of Electron, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/breaking-changes.md&quot;&gt;see our Planned Breaking Changes doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How ‘Baldur’s Gate’ Saved the Computer RPG</title>
<link>https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/21/18150363/baldurs-gate-bioware-1998-video-games</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/21/18150363/baldurs-gate-bioware-1998-video-games</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;GSib5s&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art may largely be a matter of taste, but one conclusion is close to inarguable: 1998 was the best year ever for video games, producing an unparalleled lineup of revolutionary releases that left indelible legacies and spawned series and subcultures that persist today. Throughout the year,&lt;/em&gt; The Ringer&lt;em&gt;’s gaming enthusiasts will be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2018/8/29/17795406/1998-the-best-year-ever-for-video-games&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;paying tribute to the legendary titles turning 20 in 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;by replaying them for the umpteenth time or playing them for the first time, talking to the people who made them, and analyzing both what made them great and how they made later games greater. Our series rolls another 20 with the first great game by BioWare, the boundary-breaking role-playing epic&lt;/em&gt; Baldur’s Gate&lt;em&gt;, which debuted two decades ago Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot; id=&quot;o52HwD&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;AaRK0j&quot;&gt;In late 1995, a small group of beginner game developers in Alberta who’d created a company called BioWare needed a new project. Their first title, a mech game called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattered_Steel&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shattered Steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was nearing the end of development, and the tiny studio wanted to do something different. BioWare’s founders were weaned on tabletop role-playing games and digital equivalents like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wasteland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so they decided that their second game should be a computer RPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;camu44&quot;&gt;Considering industry trends at the time, this was an uncommon course for a Western developer. The video-game review site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamerankings.com/&quot;&gt;GameRankings&lt;/a&gt; has indexed at least one review for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html?site=&amp;amp;cat=48&amp;amp;year=1995&amp;amp;numrev=2&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;letter=&amp;amp;search=&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; RPGs released in 1995. Of those 27, 21—including the top 13 by average review score—were made in Japan. The top of the list is littered with legendary Japanese developers: SquareSoft, Sega, Nintendo, Namco, Capcom. That was difficult company to crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RONqyZ&quot;&gt;“Everybody and their dog was convinced that Western RPGs were dead,” says BioWare cofounder &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TrentOster&quot;&gt;Trent Oster&lt;/a&gt;. “It was all gonna be Japanese RPGs. Nobody in the Western world knew how to make [RPGs] … there was just no hope.” If the Western RPG was dead, the Western &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; RPG was doubly dead: Every one of those top 13 RPGs from ’95 had come out on a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;asGNG4&quot;&gt;Three years later, all of those illustrious Japanese studios also appeared on the 1998 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html?site=&amp;amp;cat=48&amp;amp;year=1998&amp;amp;numrev=2&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;letter=&amp;amp;search=&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;. But close to the top, second only to Sega’s little-played &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2018/1/29/16940902/1998-video-games-panzer-dragoon-saga-missing-masterpiece&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panzer Dragoon Saga&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new name joined them: BioWare, the makers of &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ciiXtr&quot;&gt;The product of three exhausting and exhilarating years of labor by a team of roughly 15 people who didn’t know enough to be daunted by the task they undertook, &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; was a genre-stretching, disc-space-testing hybrid that broke new narrative, technical, and gameplay ground and established the identity of one of the past two decades’ most storied studios. “It just redefined expectations of what a role-playing game could be,” Oster says. “I think it really relaunched the whole concept of what a Western RPG is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;Zzny7J&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; began in a basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yOWzT1&quot;&gt;Scott Greig, who became the first official BioWare employee, remembers how he heard about the company: An intern at the business where he was doing database work told him about some friends of his father’s, medical doctors who were getting into game-making. “I’m thinking, ‘Yeah, yeah, just a couple of guys in their basement,’” Greig says. That part, Greig discovered when he eventually met them in late 1995, turned out to be true: Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, two of the three newly graduated doctors who (along with three other associates) founded BioWare in February ’95, &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; working out of Zeschuk’s basement in Edmonton. But their desire to make games was serious, and they were already working on one. “It really was two guys in the basement making video games,” Greig says, “but they were two guys in the basement with a national contract with a real publisher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UufCrW&quot;&gt;The company was looking for a lead programmer. “I was actually the only experienced game developer in the house,” says Oster, who would eventually join the &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; team as the head of the 3D art department after finishing &lt;em&gt;Shattered Steel&lt;/em&gt;. “And I mean, I had made one game. … It’s not like I knew the right way to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BUthun&quot;&gt;Greig hadn’t made games except for his own enjoyment in high school, but he had programming chops, so BioWare brought him on. By the time he started in January ’96, the company had rented a small office space above a restaurant. BioWare was no longer subterranean, although it wasn’t exactly upscale. “I particularly remember having to hold the bathroom door closed with your foot when you were going in, because it didn’t actually latch,” Greig says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;i3S7bQ&quot;&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Shattered Steel&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t out yet, BioWare wanted to create a showcase that would entice a publisher to invest in its RPG project, &lt;em&gt;Battleground: Infinity&lt;/em&gt;, which the company envisioned as an online game that would be based on ancient mythologies. Greig spent his first month cobbling together a tech demo. At that time, most game worlds were &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game&quot;&gt;tile-based&lt;/a&gt; because of contemporary computers’ memory limitations. “If you look back to the &lt;em&gt;Ultima&lt;/em&gt; games, or pretty much any other role-playing game at this point,” Greig says, “the artists would make [tiles], ‘OK, here’s the corner of a room, here’s a part of a wall,’ and these were all laid out on a regular grid. And they would assemble the background by just reusing all these pieces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5lxtPD&quot;&gt;BioWare’s inexperienced artists weren’t well-versed in the tile technique, so Greig experimented with Microsoft’s newly released &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX&quot;&gt;DirectX&lt;/a&gt; software development kit and came up with a way to import a custom, full-screen, scrollable background that he’d painted in Photoshop. He called over Muzyka, with whom he’d been discussing training the artists in the tile-based method, and showed him his alternative method. Instead of piecing together tiles, Greig told Muzyka, “‘We [could] just paint whatever we want on here, and then we could just smoothly scroll around and have the characters walk on it.’ He looks at me and goes, ‘How many CDs will that be?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cMV4ht&quot;&gt;Greig pulled out a calculator and did some math to estimate the storage requirements. “[I] said, ‘Oh, it probably won’t be more than four or five,’” he recalls. “And [Ray] goes, ‘All right. Hey, let’s do it.’ And that 10-minute conversation was basically the genesis of what ended up being &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; on the technical side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pQ70Yl&quot;&gt;A combination of new technology and a lack of skill and know-how had prompted BioWare to wander in a different direction, breaking a constraint that had hemmed in earlier games. It wouldn’t be the last time. “We were open to ideas that other people hadn’t actually tackled,” Greig says. “And it goes to show some of the power of actually having fresh ideas and inexperience in there, because we didn’t know that it couldn’t be done. So we just went ahead and did it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BY9jdv&quot;&gt;The hacked-together demo didn’t turn many heads, but it did pique the interest of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feargus_Urquhart&quot;&gt;Feargus Urquhart&lt;/a&gt;, who had just formed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Isle_Studios&quot;&gt;Black Isle Studios&lt;/a&gt;, an internal RPG development team at Interplay Productions, BioWare’s publisher for &lt;em&gt;Shattered Steel&lt;/em&gt;. Interplay, which had developed &lt;em&gt;Wasteland&lt;/em&gt; and was one of the few Western studios to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonekeep&quot;&gt;publish an RPG&lt;/a&gt; in 1995, had recently licensed the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons IP from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSR_(company)&quot;&gt;TSR, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; When Urquhart heard about BioWare’s pitch for &lt;em&gt;Battleground: Infinity&lt;/em&gt;, he realized that the studio’s RPG roots and Interplay’s lore were a match made in &lt;a href=&quot;https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mount_Celestia&quot;&gt;Mount Celestia&lt;/a&gt;. “Part of [the demo’s] description was, ‘Oh, it’s kind of like D&amp;amp;D,’” says &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt;’s head writer, Lukas Kristjanson. “And Interplay had just acquired the rights and said, ‘Well, why don’t you &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; it D&amp;amp;D?’ And a whole bunch of geeks went, ‘Whaaaat?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;n9oxmz&quot;&gt;Out went ancient mythologies. In came the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Realms&quot;&gt;Forgotten Realms&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons fantasy setting. &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; was now a D&amp;amp;D game. BioWare just had to build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;Nd8tH6&quot;&gt;“We were in unknown territory,” Greig says. The tech demo he’d designed was just the seed of what would grow into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.giantbomb.com/infinity-engine/3015-495/&quot;&gt;Infinity Engine&lt;/a&gt;, a platform featuring an isometric perspective and prerendered backgrounds that formed the backbone of &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; and its expansion and sequel, as well as Interplay’s &lt;em&gt;Planescape: Torment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icewind_Dale_(series)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Icewind Dale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There was so much infrastructure that had to be built for the game engine, because everything had to be done from scratch,” Greig says, adding, “The movie equivalent is we had to build the camera before we could film our film.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;el9Fgn&quot;&gt;BioWare planned for &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; to be a blend of old and new. “It was kind of this examination of the old &lt;em&gt;Gold Box&lt;/em&gt; games in terms of their depth and their adherence to the [D&amp;amp;D] rules,” Oster says, referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Box&quot;&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of D&amp;amp;D RPGs produced by Strategic Simulations, Inc. in the late ’80s and early ’90s. “But then bringing that forward into an almost real-time-strategy-style interface.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;DYFmUO&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was so much infrastructure that had to be built for the game engine, because everything had to be done from scratch. The movie equivalent is we had to build the camera before we could film our film.” —Scott Greig&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;H4nSb4&quot;&gt;Earlier RPGs, including the &lt;em&gt;Ultima&lt;/em&gt; games, had been difficult to control, making it complicated for players to select multiple members of their parties and tell them what to do. But Blizzard Entertainment had released &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1994 and 1995, respectively, and those two titles, along with Westwood Studios’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series, headlined a mid-’90s RTS boom based on mouse-first management rather than keyboard commands. BioWare borrowed that mouse-aided design, transplanting a new interface into an old genre where it was sorely needed. “Basically, you swipe the interface from a real-time-strategy game and plug it into a role-playing game,” Greig says. “That solved the party mechanics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bki6lC&quot;&gt;It &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; address a second problem: Mixing real-time management of up to five party members with the complexity of the D&amp;amp;D rule set made the action chaotic. “It became pretty obvious pretty quick that there was no way you were gonna be able to play the depths of D&amp;amp;D in real time without ever pausing the game,” Oster says. “That’s when we came up with the ‘pause and play’ plan.” That addition enabled players to stop in the middle of the game, queue up commands to their party, and then restart the real-time action. Although &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turns,_rounds_and_time-keeping_systems_in_games#Pausable_real-time&quot;&gt;didn’t invent&lt;/a&gt; this “active pause” approach, it did help popularize it. “When you play &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; to this day with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_Assisted_Targeting_System&quot;&gt;V.A.T.S.&lt;/a&gt; system for the slow-motion targeting, I think you can trace the origins of all that back to the ‘pause and play’ idea,” Greig says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wtMgtE&quot;&gt;Those mechanics made &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; a technical improvement upon previous RPGs, but BioWare had to fill in that framework with story and character. Lead designer James Ohlen drew on his tabletop history to create some of &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt;’s computer companions, but the bulk of the writing fell to Kristjanson, another novice in the industry who became BioWare’s first full-time narrative crafter when he was hired in October ’96 after a chance encounter with a BioWare producer who was a friend of a friend. “I had an English degree and not much idea where to put it to use,” Kristjanson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TYEZqZ&quot;&gt;He soon put it to use more than he’d bargained for, producing an estimated 70 percent of the game’s 800,000 words, including dialogue, codex entries, and journals. “It was a beast,” Kristjanson says. Ohlen’s character concepts gave him somewhere to start, but they weren’t fully fleshed out. For example, Kristjanson recalls that in the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Minsc&quot;&gt;Minsc&lt;/a&gt;, a fan-favorite human ranger whom the player can recruit as a companion, “It was, ‘This guy has a head wound and a hamster.’ OK, what do we do with that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8T4Flq&quot;&gt;For BioWare’s band of longtime tabletop players, the enormity of the creative workload was leavened by the thrill of constructing a world in which thousands of other people would play. Kristjanson remembers talking to &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; programmer Mark Darrah—who now serves as the executive producer of BioWare’s &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; series and its upcoming online action-RPG &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;—about the challenges the tight-knit team was confronting. “We were like, ‘How’s this gonna work?’” Kristjanson says. “And then, ‘Well, on tabletop it’s like this, on D&amp;amp;D it’s like this, and the last game I played it’s like this.’ We kind of looked at each other and went, ‘Holy shit. We get to figure this out?’ It’s crazy. We’re fans of this stuff, and we’re getting to build it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;s86guE&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYoRmGHIxA4?rel=0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hv2FcR&quot;&gt;For Kristjanson, the key to making the story sing was capturing the feeling of sitting around a kitchen table with a group of friends and bringing it to a computer game that was playable solo. “It’s all in character,” he says. “That was what we really realized early on. The fun of D&amp;amp;D is the controlled chaos of the party, the different personalities. Not just a pile of skills you throw at monsters, but the personalities that clash or flow with the story based on what you choose to do and who you choose to do it with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8nE7dy&quot;&gt;The quality of &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt;’s dialogue, and the distinct identities of its 24 companions and hundreds of minor characters, set it apart from many of the trope-ridden titles that preceded it, whose appeal flowed much more from combat than from conversation. The game’s cast of non-player companions—many of whom, in a relative rarity for the era, were convincingly voiced—was a diverse group. Three of the five core party members were women (&lt;a href=&quot;http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Dynaheir&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of whom was voiced by the prolific &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Hale&quot;&gt;Jennifer Hale&lt;/a&gt;), and some story lines touch on sensitive subjects; when the protagonist encounters &lt;a href=&quot;http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Viconia_DeVir&quot;&gt;Viconia DeVir&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, she’s being persecuted because she’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://baldursgate.wikia.com/wiki/Drow&quot;&gt;drow&lt;/a&gt;, or dark-skinned elf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;NWFoQZ&quot;&gt;Although the fledgling BioWare wasn’t particularly diverse, Kristjanson—whose background lay in tabletop D&amp;amp;D, not the previous computer adaptations—sought to make the companions mirror his real-life companions, who had always been contrasting both in personality (including “the friend across the table who’s slightly gooned on Mountain Dew”) and in terms of race and gender. “You have this broad mix of everybody bringing their particular flavor of weird and great to the table, and that requires a huge spread of characters,” he says, adding, “They weren’t all just dudes like me. … That’s what I wanted to see in the game, because that’s part of what made it great.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;0EpmgG&quot;&gt;Oster credits Greig’s database background for &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt;’s massive size. “Most of the other game developers looked first and foremost at it from a gaming/game-experience side, not ‘How do I represent data and access data in an effective manner,’” he says. “So we were just able to huck around huge volumes of assets.” As Greig had foretold, &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; filled five discs. According to user-submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/25/16038806/video-game-length-playtimes-f7b8e38f949f&quot;&gt;playthrough lengths&lt;/a&gt; at the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=808&quot;&gt;How Long to Beat&lt;/a&gt;, a typical playthrough of the main story lasts 44.5 hours, while a “completionist” playthrough averages 106 hours. As in &lt;em&gt;Wasteland&lt;/em&gt;, Muzyka’s RPG touchstone, many scenarios could play out in more than one way, offering extra replay value. Compared with the typical game of the era, Oster says, “It’s just ridiculous when you analyze the scale of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;FZlvbC&quot;&gt;Because &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; was so big and the BioWare team, while sizable for the era, was small by modern standards, development was highly collaborative. “It wasn’t like, ‘OK, this was my job,’ and you just stuck to it,” Greig says. “You basically did whatever needed to get done, and there was lots of input from everybody around. … Even the junior quality-assurance tester guy had probably more influence on &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; than a senior producer does on some of the Triple-A game titles that are out right now.” Even though Greig was the lead programmer and wasn’t directly responsible for the story, he still read all of the Forgotten Realms sourcebooks to immerse himself in the setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kXUghk&quot;&gt;That all-hands-on-deck ethos was partly attributable to the team’s enthusiasm for what they were making, and partly a reflection of the fact they were too new to the industry to be burned out. But it was also a by-product of BioWare biting off more than it could comfortably chew. “The general attitude was, ‘We’d like to do this, how hard could it be?’” Greig says. “But it turns out it’s really freaking hard to make video games.” So hard, in fact, that a more experienced staff likely would have set its sights a little lower. “I think the biggest asset of our inexperience was the fact we didn’t know how hard the work was gonna be and how much there was going to be,” Oster says. “We underestimated everything so profoundly that it sounded reasonable, when in that time and place it was actually quite an unreasonable thing to attempt to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Au1OU9&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We underestimated everything so profoundly that it sounded reasonable, when in that time and place it was actually quite an unreasonable thing to attempt to do.” —Trent Oster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3J00ED&quot;&gt;That breadth of content came at a cost to the developers, who spent roughly the last year of production in crunch mode and the last six months or so working seven days a week, 10-12 hours a day, and sometimes sleeping at their desks. “We’d work, we’d eat pizza, we’d work some more, and I swear after &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; came out, I wasn’t able to eat a slice of pizza for a year and a half,” Greig says. Although Oster notes that he and the rest of the team took it upon themselves to work those hours, out of belief in &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; and a sense of solidarity with their colleagues, that kind of crunch—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2018/3/30/17179036/1998-video-games-starcraft-turns-20&quot;&gt;not uncommon&lt;/a&gt; among 1998’s standout titles—can be counterproductive and harmful and, despite the many other ways in which game-making has moved forward, remains a blight on the backstories of many &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466&quot;&gt;great titles&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;owD7Mo&quot;&gt;After logging all of those hours (and enduring multiple three-month delays), BioWare believed it might have a hit on its hands. For Interplay, though, &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; didn’t project to be a massive seller. The publisher’s previous D&amp;amp;D titles hadn’t been blockbusters, and neither &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; nor BioWare had a built-in brand, so Interplay wasn’t planning a full-court press. “They were doing their standard marketing thing, which at that point was, you take out a bunch of ads a couple months before the game comes out in some various magazines like &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; … and, that’s pretty much it,” Greig says. “We had been putting our heart and soul into this thing, and it’s like, ‘Oh, you’ve got to do something better than that.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SUCHOX&quot;&gt;More out of unbridled enthusiasm than any coordinated marketing strategy, BioWare members began to talk up the game themselves, providing updates and answering questions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet&quot;&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt; and message boards devoted to D&amp;amp;D. By the time the game came out, BioWare’s infectious, patient, and transparent posts had built up anticipation in the target market. Greig remembers one of the major trade magazines projecting &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; for 100,000 copies sold. Even internally, BioWare hoped for only 200,000, which would be enough to justify a sequel. Then the game came out. “It started to sell fairly well, and then it sold even better, and [then] the sales just took off,” Oster says. “And it was mostly from organic-style marketing—word of mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zTntIf&quot;&gt;A press release on ship day &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110727205647/http:/rpgvaultarchive.ign.com/archive/19981220.shtml&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; “a near frenzy” at “several mall-based stores” and quoted multiple sources testifying to frantic presale activity. &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; became the best-selling game in the two weeks following its release, moving &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19990909093649/http:/interplay.com/press/bgno1.html&quot;&gt;175,000&lt;/a&gt; copies in that time and vindicating BioWare’s pre-release outreach. It topped &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20010224020250/http:/headline.gamespot.com/news/99_02/24_pc_interplay/index.html&quot;&gt;500,000&lt;/a&gt; by the end of February and hit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120510051328/https:/www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131493/baldurs_gate_ii_the_anatomy_of_a_.php&quot;&gt;1.5 million&lt;/a&gt; mark by May 2001. “This is a 100 percent standard procedure now for any game,” Greig says. “A key part of the marketing is engaging with the core audience and doing developer diaries, and they’ve got teams of people whose job is just to do this.” Inadvertently, BioWare had helped guide developers in how to sell games as well as how to make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jPw9jn&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; garnered Game of the Year and RPG of the Year honors from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate#Critical_reviews&quot;&gt;multitude&lt;/a&gt; of outlets, and its 2000 sequel—which benefited from a more polished Infinity Engine that didn’t have to be built from scratch—was even &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_II:_Shadows_of_Amn#Critical_reviews&quot;&gt;more highly acclaimed&lt;/a&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate II&lt;/em&gt; was about us actually, finally knowing how to make a game,” Oster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;u8BKTf&quot;&gt;The team behind &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; went on to make many more. “When I got the job, a friend of my now-wife said, ‘Ha, gaming company. Well, that won’t last six months,’” Kristjanson says. “Because game companies were flaming out left and right.” Twenty-two years later, he’s still at BioWare, where some of his younger colleagues, like &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; writer Sheryl Chee, cite &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; as influences. “Every now and then she brings it up that she played &lt;em&gt;BG I&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BG II&lt;/em&gt; six times as a kid, and that was escape,” Kristjanson says. “I’m like, ‘This is weird.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pKQbMx&quot;&gt;Although many of BioWare’s other early pioneers, including Greig and all of the cofounders, have since &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare#2010s:_Muzyka_and_Zeschuk's_departure,_Mass_Effect_on_hiatus,_Anthem&quot;&gt;moved on&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s output over the past 20 years owes a debt to that first, formative RPG. “&lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; literally set up every game that BioWare ever made,” Oster says. “So, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jade Empire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;—they’re all kind of from that original DNA. If you pull back from all the flashy bits and all the high-end graphics and all the cinematic conversation, there’s a lot of similarities there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;F6HYLF&quot;&gt;Oster still hasn’t quite quit the original. In 2009, he and another &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; alum, Cameron Tofer, founded a new studio, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beamdog.com/&quot;&gt;Beamdog&lt;/a&gt;, which now occupies the same office floor that BioWare did during the &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; days. In 2012, Beamdog developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Enhanced_Edition&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a remake published by Atari (which now owns the &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; license) that incorporated enhancements and additions and extended support to mobile platforms but started with the same code to preserve the familiar feel. “We approached it more as curators than reimagining it,” he says. “We didn’t want to rethink what &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; was. We wanted to make the best version of &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; that we could.” The &lt;em&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/em&gt; continues to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.beamdog.com/2018/08/updates-to-baldurs-gate-enhanced.html&quot;&gt;patched&lt;/a&gt;. “I still see areas where I think we can make things better,” Oster says. In 2016, his company produced an original expansion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Siege_of_Dragonspear&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siege of Dragonspear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was set between the events of &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate I&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;II&lt;/em&gt; and represented the first original &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; game in more than 15 years, not counting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate:_Dark_Alliance&quot;&gt;console spinoffs&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-the-works-apparently/&quot;&gt;swirling&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_(series)#Unfinished_games&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although Oster says it’s not being made by Beamdog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YOkVxG&quot;&gt;In a sense, an actual sequel seems extraneous, because so many spiritual sequels keep carrying the torch, from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Eternity&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pillars of Eternity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity:_Original_Sin&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series to 2017’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torment:_Tides_of_Numenera&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Torment: Tides of Numenera&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to 2018’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder:_Kingmaker&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pathfinder: Kingmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All of those games were crowdfunded through Kickstarter, which has seen a sort of isometric boom as developers capitalize on players’ continued affection for the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;8QYzht&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dG-4Gp3XNiw?rel=0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ja1op9&quot;&gt;“The ones that have been successful haven’t tried to remake what we did, because when we made it we weren’t trying to make &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt;,” Kristjanson says, adding, “You can reduce that too much to, ‘Oh, this should be authentic D&amp;amp;D with the numbers.’ Well, even D&amp;amp;D isn’t authentic D&amp;amp;D. It’s every group has their house rule, and that house rule is because of the way that your particular collection of awesome weirdos wants to play it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-end-para&quot; id=&quot;xB4cck&quot;&gt;While writing for &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt;, Kristjanson learned that world-building is about asking questions more than it is about answering them. “For every time you answer a question, you should pose a couple more, because otherwise the world is just getting smaller instead of broadening out,” he says. Twenty years later, the world &lt;em&gt;Baldur’s Gate&lt;/em&gt; built is still expanding. “If you’re lucky, you get to take some of all this stuff that inspired you, all the stuff you thought was great, and you build something that’s worthy for someone else to build on whenever they come after you,” Greig says. “That is basically the best you can do as any type of artist.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC fines Swarm $900K for unauthorized satellite launch</title>
<link>https://reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1OJ2WT</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1OJ2WT</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Swarm Technologies Inc will pay a $900,000 fine for launching and operating four small experimental communications satellites that risked “satellite collisions” and threatened “critical commercial and government satellite operations,” the Federal Communications Commission said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California-based start-up founded by former Google and Apple engineers in 2016 also agreed to enhanced FCC oversight and a requirement of pre-launch notices to the FCC for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm launched the satellites in India last January after the FCC rejected its application to deploy and operate them, citing concerns about the company’s tracking ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Swarm had unlawfully transmitted signals between earth stations in the state of Georgia and the satellites for over a week. The investigation also found that Swarm performed unauthorized weather balloon-to-ground station tests and other unauthorized equipment tests prior to the satellites’ launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm aims to provide low-cost space-based internet service and plans eventually to use a constellation of 100 satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm won permission in August from the FCC to reactivate the satellites and said then it is “fully committed to complying with all regulations and has been working closely with the FCC,” noting that its satellites are “100 percent trackable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Sara Spangelo said in a statement on Thursday that the company accepts the FCC decision “and appreciates the FCC’s ongoing support for Swarm’s mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, SpaceX launched three more satellites for Swarm on a Falcon 9 rocket after winning FCC approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly said the size of the penalty “is probably not significant enough to deter future behavior, but the negative press coverage is likely to prevent this company and others from attempting to do this again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Rielly said an initial fine negotiated by FCC staff was rejected by some commissioners, which led to reopening settlement talks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Indian government to intercept, monitor, and decrypt citizens’ computers</title>
<link>https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/21/indian-government-to-intercept-monitor-and-decrypt-citizens-computers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/21/indian-government-to-intercept-monitor-and-decrypt-citizens-computers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Indian government has authorized 10 central agencies to intercept, monitor, and decrypt data on any computer, sending a shock wave through citizens and privacy watchdogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi’s government late Thursday broadened the scope of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Act,_2000&quot;&gt;Section 69 of the nation’s IT Act, 2000&lt;/a&gt; to require a subscriber, service provider, or any person in charge of a computer to “extend all facilities and technical assistance to the agencies.” Failure to comply with the agencies could result in seven years of imprisonment and an unspecified fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1556945&quot;&gt;clarification&lt;/a&gt; posted today, the Ministry of Home Affairs said each case of interception, monitoring, and decryption is to be approved by the competent authority, which is the Union Home Secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agencies that have been authorized with this new power are the Intelligence Bureau, Narcotics Control Bureau, Enforcement Directorate, Central Board of Direct Taxes, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Research and Analysis Wing, Directorate of Signal Intelligence (in service areas of J-K, North East, and Assam), and Delhi Police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining the rationale behind the order, India’s IT minister, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ETNOWlive/status/1076065365770285056&quot;&gt;Ravi Shankar Prasad, said&lt;/a&gt; the measure was undertaken in the interests of national security. He added that some form of “tapping” has already been going on in the country for a number of years and that the new order would help bring structure to that process. “Always remember one thing,” he said in a televised interview. “Even in the case of a particular individual, the interception order shall not be effective unless affirmed by the Home Secretary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apprehension among citizens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetfreedom.in&quot;&gt;Internet Freedom Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization that protects the online rights of citizens in India, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1076007566193369089&quot;&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; that the order goes &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1076026199577636864&quot;&gt;beyond telephone tapping&lt;/a&gt;. It includes looking at content streams and might even involve breaking encryption in some cases. “Imagine your search queries on Google over [a number of] years being demanded — mixed with your WhatsApp metadata, who you talk to, when, and how much [and add] layers of data streams from emails + Facebook,”  &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1076006893263486976&quot;&gt;the group said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To us, this order is unconstitutional and in breach of the telephone tapping guidelines, the Privacy Judgement, and the Aadhaar Judgement,” it asserted, adding that it was working with volunteers and lawyers to further scrutinize the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition political parties also expressed concern about the order. “From Modi sarkar [Hindi for government] to stalker sarkar, clearly the string of losses has left the BJP government desperate for information,” the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1076002609855586304&quot;&gt;Congress political party said.&lt;/a&gt;  Senior &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CNNnews18/status/1075993241965588480&quot;&gt;Congress leader P Chidambaram added&lt;/a&gt;, “If anybody is going to monitor the computer, including your computer, that is the Orwellian state. George Orwell is around the corner. It is condemnable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;10.208955223881&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is overbroad, has a chilling effect and is liable to be struck down in toto: still amazing how many government actions on online regulation have been straight up, ex-facie unconstitutional. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nOhI8vA2Tx&quot;&gt;https://t.co/nOhI8vA2Tx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT Minister Prasad lashed out at the opposition, asking whether they believe the government should not do anything to halt the proliferation of terrorist activities, which he alleged are being conducted on the internet. (Prasad and other ministers have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/25/whatsapp-struggles-with-incendiary-and-fake-messages-in-india/&quot;&gt;similar arguments&lt;/a&gt; in coercing Facebook to &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/23/whatsapp-balks-at-indias-demand-to-break-encryption/&quot;&gt;break WhatsApp’s encryption in India&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat has reached out to Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon for comment and will update if we hear back. Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move by the Indian government comes days after the Australian government, in a global first, took a stricter approach to the way communications service are handled within its borders. Earlier this month, the Australian parliament &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-security-data/australia-passes-bill-to-force-tech-firms-to-hand-over-encrypted-data-idUSKBN1O42SR&quot;&gt;passed laws&lt;/a&gt; giving police and security agencies in the nation the power to access messages on encrypted platforms. The government said it is taking this step in an effort to combat terrorism and other crime.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Porting Alpine Linux to RISC-V</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/12/20/Porting-Alpine-Linux-to-RISC-V.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/12/20/Porting-Alpine-Linux-to-RISC-V.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unleashed&quot;&gt;HiFive Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;, after several excruciating months of waiting, and it’s incredibly cool. For those unaware, the HiFive Unleashed is the first consumer-facing Linux-capable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V&quot;&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; hardware. For anyone who’s still lost, RISC-V is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/riscv&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;, royalty-free &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture&quot;&gt;instruction set architecture&lt;/a&gt;, and the HiFive is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sifive&quot;&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; CPU implementing it. And here it is on my dining room table:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sr.ht/JMao.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This board is &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;. I’m working on making this hardware available to &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.sr.ht&quot;&gt;builds.sr.ht&lt;/a&gt; users in the next few months, where I intend to use it to automate the remainder of the Alpine Linux port and make it available to any other operating systems (including non-Linux) and userspace software which are interested in working on a RISC-V port. I’m fairly certain that this will be the first time hardware-backed RISC-V cycles are being made available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two phases to porting an operating system to a new architecture: bootstrapping and, uh, porting. For lack of a better term. As part of bootstrapping, you need to obtain a cross-compiler, port libc, and cross-compile the basics. Bootstrapping ends once the system is &lt;em&gt;self-hosting&lt;/em&gt;: able to compile itself. The “porting” process involves compiling all of the packages available for your operating system, which can take a long time and is generally automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first order of business is the cross-compiler. RISC-V support landed in binutils 2.28 and gcc 7.1 several releases ago, so no need to worry about adding a RISC-V target to our compiler. Building both with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--target=riscv64-linux-musl&lt;/code&gt; is sufficient to complete this step. The other major piece is the C standard library, or libc. Unlike the C compiler, this step required some extra effort on my part - the RISC-V port of musl libc, which Alpine Linux is based on, is a work-in-progress and has not yet been upstreamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does exist &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/riscv/riscv-musl&quot;&gt;a patch&lt;/a&gt; for RISC-V support, though it had never been tested at a scale like this. Accordingly, I ran into several bugs, for which I wrote several patches (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/riscv/riscv-musl/pull/2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/riscv/riscv-musl/pull/3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/riscv/riscv-musl/pull/4&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). Having a working distro based on the RISC-V port makes a much more compelling argument for the maturity of the port, and for its inclusion upstream, so I’m happy to have caught these issues. Until then, I added the port and my patches to the Alpine Linux musl package manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A C compiler and libc implementation open the floodgates to porting a huge volume of software to your platform. The next step is to identify and port the essential packages for a self-hosting system. For this, Alpine has a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/tree/scripts/bootstrap.sh&quot;&gt;bootstrapping script&lt;/a&gt; which handles preparing the cross-compiler and building the base system. Many (if not most) of these packages required patching, tweaks, and manual intervention - this isn’t a turnkey solution - but it is an incredibly useful tool. The most important packages at this step are the native toolchain&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;, the package manager itself, and various other useful things like tar, patch, openssl, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the essential packages are built and the system can compile itself, the long porting process begins. It’s generally wise to drop the cross-compiler here and start doing native builds, if your hardware is fast enough. This is a tradeoff, because the RISC-V system is somewhat slower than my x86_64 bootstrap machine - but many packages require lots of manual tweaks and patching to get cross-compiling working. The time saved by not worrying about this makes up for the slower build times&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of packages, so the next step for me (and anyone else working on a port) is to automate the remainder of the process. For me, an intermediate step is integrating this with builds.sr.ht to organize my own work and to make cycles available to other people interested in RISC-V. Not all packages are going to be ported for free - but many will! Once you unlock the programming languages - C, Python, Perl, Ruby&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;, etc - most open source software is pretty portable across architectures. One of my core goals with sr.ht is to encourage portable software to proliferate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any readers have their own RISC-V hardware, or want to try it with qemu, I have a RISC-V Alpine Linux repository here&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;/&gt;. Something like this will install it to /mnt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;apk add &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-X&lt;/span&gt; https://mirror.sr.ht/alpine/main/ &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--allow-untrusted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--arch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;riscv64 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/mnt &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    alpine-base alpine-sdk vim chrony
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin/busybox --install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apk fix&lt;/code&gt; on first boot. This is still a work in progress, so configuring the rest is an exercise left to the reader until I can clean up the process and make a nice install script. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing note: big thanks to the help from the community in #riscv on Freenode, and to the hard work of the Debian and Fedora teams paving a lot of the way and getting patches out there for lots of software! I still got to have all the fun working on musl so I wasn’t entirely on the beaten path :)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Advocating for privacy in Australia</title>
<link>https://fastmail.blog/2018/12/21/advocating-for-privacy-aabill-australia/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://fastmail.blog/2018/12/21/advocating-for-privacy-aabill-australia/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;For over twenty years, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act has governed how Australian law enforcement can request data from Australian service providers like ourselves. It allows law enforcement to get a warrant for subscriber information and stored communications, while providing safeguards for user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia’s parliament recently passed the Access and Assistance Bill (AABill), which focuses on services built with end-to-end encryption. This new bill allows law enforcement to compel companies to modify their services and intercept data from their customers in its unencrypted form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;howfastmailusesencryption&quot;&gt;How FastMail uses encryption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we securely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/ourservice/security.html&quot;&gt;encrypt all your data&lt;/a&gt;, we have the keys to decrypt that data in order to let you search your email, use standard internet protocols, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/account/icantlogin.html&quot;&gt;recover access to your data if you lose your password&lt;/a&gt; (which happens more often than you might think!). Server-side processing of data is essential to the services we offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, should our users choose to end-to-end encrypt their mail via PGP, we have no way to access that content, even under the AABill. Our blog explains &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2016/12/10/why-we-dont-offer-pgp/&quot;&gt;why we have never offered PGP ourselves&lt;/a&gt;, and describes &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2016/12/23/pgp-tools-with-fastmail/&quot;&gt;third-party PGP tools you can use with FastMail&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to manage your own encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theaabilldoesntchangeyourprivacyordatasecuritywithfastmail&quot;&gt;The AABill doesn’t change your privacy or data security with FastMail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FastMail won’t be making changes to our technology or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/help/ourservice/security.html&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; in response to this bill. Law enforcement has always been able to request information from us through the Telecommunications Act with a lawful warrant. Because we have the ability to decrypt all data, there is no need to make changes that circumvent encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every warrant we receive is reviewed by senior staff for legitimacy and scope before data is provided. Each account whose data is requested must be individually identified. Responding for one user does not require us to expose or share the data of our other customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like more information on what is actually in the AABill, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-actually-in-australias-encryption-laws-everything-you-need-to-know/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; has a clear breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ourcriticismsoftheaabill&quot;&gt;Our criticisms of the AABill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AABill has raised concerns from technology companies and privacy supporters around the world, and deservedly so. While FastMail is not directly affected, we don’t support this legislation because it carries serious implications for the Australian tech industry. We are working with industry groups and digital privacy organisations to campaign for changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption is a tool that provides many positive protections: most websites on the internet are now &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/2018/09/06/secure-website-support/&quot;&gt;encrypted&lt;/a&gt; so that onlookers can’t see what you’re viewing. Nobody would shop on the internet without the protection of encryption guarding your bank information!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bill has the capacity to weaken encryption. Compromising security can have unintentional consequences, and the focus of most industry pushback is on embedding &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)&quot;&gt;backdoors&lt;/a&gt; to give law enforcement access to information that they otherwise could not read. Technologists know it’s hard to control access to backdoors, and worry about them being weaponised by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the bill itself, and the controversy around the process by which it passed, have damaged the reputation of Australia in the international marketplace. The AABill was passed in spite of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/TelcoAmendmentBill2018/Submissions&quot;&gt;overwhelming number of submissions&lt;/a&gt; pointing out flaws. Many now view Australian service providers, companies, and contractors with suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also concerns that individual employees may be forced to build a backdoor, without being able to alert their employer. While frightening for anyone working in technology, we believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-encryption-laws-are-highly-unlikely-to-dragoon-employees-in-secret/&quot;&gt;this fear is largely unfounded&lt;/a&gt;. Most organisations have practices (pair programming, code reviews, risk evaluations) that would reveal such behaviour quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;actionswearetaking&quot;&gt;Actions we are taking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad actors exist, and law enforcement needs tools to stop them. As the AABill stands, we believe the risk it adds to the general public’s privacy and security is too high for the access it can gain. Besides our general issue advocacy, we’re taking a number of specific actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.blog/accessbill-submission/&quot;&gt;our opposition to the bill&lt;/a&gt; during the parliamentary enquiry back in September.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are composing an updated statement to submit to the PJCIS (Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security) who are on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/ReviewofTOLAAct&quot;&gt;third round of inquiries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have been contacting our members of parliament and senators since the last vote, to help them understand the technology they’re policing and the ways in which this bill is negatively impacting our industry and our customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are working with industry bodies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.efa.org.au&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontiers of Australia (EFA)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalrightswatch.org.au&quot;&gt;Digital Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and other Australian tech firms to put forward a united call for sensible amendments to the law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;howyoucanhelp&quot;&gt;How you can help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is great for raising awareness but insufficient to create change in legislation. We encourage you to reach out directly if this issue matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australians: Contact your MP, on behalf of yourself, or your company (if you have the authority to do so). The EFA has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.efa.org.au/get-involved/lobbying/&quot;&gt;step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to find out who your representative is, and the best way to get a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate your friends, your colleagues, your family and ask them to also talk to their MPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/ReviewofTOLAAct&quot;&gt;Australians and others: Submit a letter to the PJCIS&lt;/a&gt; by the end of March 2019. The inquiry is there to record concerns from anyone affected by the bill. Don’t hold off submitting because you think someone else will do it, or because you’re not sure what to say. Every entry helps our lawmakers see the breadth and depth of the impact of the new law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not an Australian, be aware that the appetite for this type of law is not limited to Australia. Stay informed and engaged with this topic in your part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public awareness of online privacy and security is increasing. We at FastMail believe we have a responsibility to be proactive about educating and advocating for good privacy principles and practices. Digital privacy is no longer the sole domain of the deeply technical user, but a fundamental right and responsibility of every individual online.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CBD and hemp are now legal in the U.S</title>
<link>https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628988.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm628988.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 was signed into law. Among other things, this new law changes certain federal authorities relating to the production and marketing of hemp, defined as cannabis (&lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa L.&lt;/em&gt;), and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These changes include removing hemp from the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it will no longer be an illegal substance under federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as important for the FDA and our commitment to protect and promote the public health is what the law &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; change: Congress explicitly preserved the agency’s current authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;amp;C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In doing so, Congress recognized the agency’s important public health role with respect to all the products it regulates. This allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect patients and the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re aware of the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including cannabidiol (CBD). This increasing public interest in these products makes it even more important with the passage of this law for the FDA to clarify its regulatory authority over these products. In short, we treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as we do any other FDA-regulated products — meaning they’re subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance. This is true regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the Agriculture Improvement Act. To help members of the public understand how the FDA’s requirements apply to these products, the FDA has maintained a &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm421168.htm&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; with answers to frequently asked questions, which we intend to update moving forward to address questions regarding the Agriculture Improvement Act and regulation of these products generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the proliferation of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived substances, the FDA will advance new steps to better define our public health obligations in this area. We’ll also continue to closely scrutinize products that could pose risks to consumers. Where we believe consumers are being put at risk, the FDA will warn consumers and take enforcement actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we continue to be concerned at the number of drug claims being made about products not approved by the FDA that claim to contain CBD or other cannabis-derived compounds. Among other things, the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. This is the same standard to which we hold any product marketed as a drug for human or animal use. Cannabis and cannabis-derived products claiming in their marketing and promotional materials that they’re intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases (such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, psychiatric disorders and diabetes) are considered new drugs or new animal drugs and must go through the FDA drug approval process for human or animal use before they are marketed in the U.S. Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective. This deceptive marketing of unproven treatments raises significant public health concerns, as it may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it’s unlawful under the FD&amp;amp;C Act to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. This is because both CBD and THC are active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs and were the subject of substantial clinical investigations before they were marketed as foods or dietary supplements. Under the FD&amp;amp;C Act, it’s illegal to introduce drug ingredients like these into the food supply, or to market them as dietary supplements. This is a requirement that we apply across the board to food products that contain substances that are active ingredients in any drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll take enforcement action needed to protect public health against companies illegally selling cannabis and cannabis-derived products that can put consumers at risk and are being marketed in violation of the FDA’s authorities. The FDA has sent &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm484109.htm&quot;&gt;warning letters&lt;/a&gt; in the past to companies illegally selling CBD products that claimed to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer. Some of these products were in further violation of the FD&amp;amp;C Act because they were marketed as dietary supplements or because they involved the addition of CBD to food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds remain subject to the FDA’s authorities and requirements, there are pathways available for those who seek to lawfully introduce these products into interstate commerce. The FDA will continue to take steps to make the pathways for the lawful marketing of these products more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pathways include ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market with therapeutic claims a human or animal drug that is derived from cannabis. For example, in June 2018, the FDA approved a drug, &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm611046.htm&quot;&gt;Epidiolex&lt;/a&gt;, that contains cannabis-derived CBD for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. That approval was based on adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, which gives prescribers confidence in the drug’s uniform strength and consistent delivery that support appropriate dosing needed for treating patients with these complex and serious epilepsy syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, pathways remain available for the FDA to consider whether there are circumstances in which certain cannabis-derived compounds might be permitted in a food or dietary supplement. Although such products are generally prohibited to be introduced in interstate commerce, the FDA has authority to issue a regulation allowing the use of a pharmaceutical ingredient in a food or dietary supplement. We are taking new steps to evaluate whether we should pursue such a process. However, the FDA would only consider doing so if the agency were able to determine that all other requirements in the FD&amp;amp;C Act are met, including those required for food additives or new dietary ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that some foods are derived from parts of the hemp plant that may not contain CBD or THC, meaning that their addition to foods might not raise the same issues as the addition of drug ingredients like CBD and THC. We are able to advance the lawful marketing of three such ingredients today. We are announcing that the agency has completed our evaluation of three &lt;a target=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/Food/NewsEvents/ConstituentUpdates/ucm628910.htm&quot;&gt;Generally Recognized as Safe&lt;/a&gt; (GRAS) notices related to hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil and that the agency had no questions regarding the company’s conclusion that the use of such products as described in the notices is safe. Therefore, these products can be legally marketed in human foods for these uses without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make disease treatment claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the substantial public interest in this topic and the clear interest of Congress in fostering the development of appropriate hemp products, we intend to hold a public meeting in the near future for stakeholders to share their experiences and challenges with these products, including information and views related to the safety of such products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll use this meeting to gather additional input relevant to the lawful pathways by which products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds can be marketed, and how we can make these legal pathways more predictable and efficient. We’ll also solicit input relevant to our regulatory strategy related to existing products, while we continue to evaluate and take action against products that are being unlawfully marketed and create risks for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we recognize the potential opportunities that cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds could offer and acknowledge the significant interest in these possibilities. We’re committed to pursuing an efficient regulatory framework for allowing product developers that meet the requirements under our authorities to lawfully market these types of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>At Blind, a security lapse revealed private complaints from tech employees</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/blind-anonymous-app-data-exposure/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;featured__span-first-words&quot;&gt;Thousands of people&lt;/span&gt; trusted Blind, an app-based “anonymous social network,” as a safe way to reveal malfeasance, wrongdoing and improper conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/10/hr-has-lost-the-trust-of-employees-here-is-who-has-it-now/&quot;&gt;at their companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Blind left one of its database servers exposed without a password, making it possible (for anyone who knew where to look) to access each user’s account information and identify would-be whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korea-founded company made its way into the U.S. in 2015, when it quickly became a highly popular anonymous social network for major tech companies, touting employees from Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Uber and more. Blind last month secured &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1651006/000165100618000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml&quot;&gt;another $10 million&lt;/a&gt; in new funding after a $6 million raise in 2017. But it was only when the social network became the root of several high-profile scandals that Blind gained mainstream attention, including revealing allegations of sexual harassment at Uber — which later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/blind-anonymous-chat-app-once-banned-by-uber-expanding-funding-round-2017-5&quot;&gt;blocked the app&lt;/a&gt; on its corporate network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exposed server was found by a security researcher, who goes by the name Mossab H, who informed the company of the security lapse. The security researcher found one of the company’s Kibana dashboards for its backend ElasticSearch database, which contained several tables, including private messaging data and web-based content, for both of its U.S. and Korean sites. Blind said the exposure only affects users who signed up or logged in between November 1 and December 19, and that the exposure relates to “a single server, one among many servers on our platform,” according to Blind executive Kyum Kim in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind only pulled the database after TechCrunch followed up by email a week later. The company began emailing its users on Thursday after we asked for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While developing an internal tool to improve our service for our users, we became aware of an error that exposed user data,” the email to affected users said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim said there is “no evidence” that the database was misappropriated or misused, but did not say how it came to that conclusion. When asked, the company would not say if it will notify U.S. state regulators of the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind’s chief executive Sunguk Moon, who was copied on many of the emails with TechCrunch, did not comment or acknowledge the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, the app and anonymous social network allows users to sign up using their corporate email address, which is said to be linked only to Blind’s member ID. Email addresses are “only used for verification” to allow users to talk to other anonymous people in their company, and the company claims that email addresses aren’t stored on its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after reviewing a portion of the exposed data, some of the company’s claims do not stand up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that the database provided a real-time stream of user logins, user posts, comments and other interactions, allowing anyone to read private comments and posts. The database also revealed the unencrypted private messages between members but not their associated email addresses. &lt;em&gt;(Given the high sensitivity of the data and the privacy of the affected users, we’re not posting data, screenshots or specifics of user content.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blind claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.li/NpniG&quot;&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; that its email verification “is safe, as our patented infrastructure is set up so that all user account and activity information is completely disconnected from the email verification process.” It adds: “This effectively means there is no way to trace back your activity on Blind to an email address, because even we can’t do it.” Blind claims that the database “does not show any mapping of email addresses to nicknames,” but we found streams of email addresses associated with members who had not yet posted. In our brief review, we didn’t find any content, such as comments or messages, linked to email addresses, just a unique member ID, which could identify a user who posts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many records did, however, contain plain text email addresses. When other records didn’t store an email address, the record contained the user’s email as an unrecognized encrypted hash — which may be decipherable to Blind employees, but not to anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database also contained passwords, which were stored as an MD5 hash, a long-outdated algorithm that is nowadays easy to crack. Many of the passwords were quickly unscrambled using readily available tools when we tried. Kim denied this. “We don’t use MD5 for our passwords to store them,” he said. “The MD5 keys were a log and it does not represent how we are managing data. We use more advanced methods like salted hash and SHA2 on securing users’ data in our database.” (Logging in with an email address and unscrambled password would be unlawful, therefore we cannot verify this claim.) That may pose a risk to employees who use the same password on the app as they do to log in to their corporate accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the company’s apparent efforts to disassociate email addresses from its platform, login records in the database also stored user account access tokens — the same kind of tokens that recently put &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/microsoft-login-bug-hijack-office-accounts/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/12/facebook-breach/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; accounts at risk. If a malicious actor took and used a token, they could log in as that user — effectively removing any anonymity they might have had from the database in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well-intentioned as the app may be, the database exposure puts users — who trusted the app to keep their information safe and their identities anonymous — at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t just users, but also employees of some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley, who post about sexual harassment in the workplace and discussing job offers and workplace culture. Many of those who signed up in the past month include senior executives at major tech companies but don’t realize that their email address — which identifies them — could be sitting plain text in an exposed database. Some users sent anonymous, private messages, in some cases made serious allegations against their colleagues or their managers, while others expressed concern that their employers were monitoring their emails for Blind sign-up emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, it likely escaped many that the app they were using — often for relief, for empathy or as a way to disclose wrongdoing — was almost entirely unencrypted and could be accessed, not only by the app’s employees but also for a time anyone on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
