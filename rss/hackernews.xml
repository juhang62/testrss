&lt;header&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://schepp.dev/img/natalya-letunova-gF8aHM445P4-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View from within the ruins of the Monument House of he Bulgarian Communist Party, built on Buzludzha Peak in central Bulgaria. Photo by Natalya Letunova on Unsplash&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I was always fascinated by stories about ancient civilizations. I devoured books about Atlantis, or the story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann&quot;&gt;Heinrich Schliemann&lt;/a&gt;'s discovery of Troy, stories about the Greek, the Romans, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire&quot;&gt;Inca Empire&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt&quot;&gt;Ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. And I was always fascinated by the extent of their capabilities in the fields of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-astronomical-genius-of-the-inca/&quot;&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras&quot;&gt;math&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_medicine&quot;&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;, their incredible achievements, like building those vast monuments, or their highly functional social systems. What's even more incredible is that most of this already happened way before Jesus Christ first set foot on our Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, all these eras of highly developed civilizations one day came to an end. Some just died out quietly, some were outpaced by civilizations with better military capabilities. Most of the time when that happened, the capabilities of the defeated ones &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; carry over to the now dominating group, thereby enriching their pool, but instead vanished. Which I always found unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-era-of-the-trident-engine&quot;&gt;The Era of the Trident Engine &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#the-era-of-the-trident-engine&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting now, Microsoft will roll out their new Chromium-based Edge browser to their millions of Windows 10 users. And this will also mark the end of an era. &lt;em&gt;The era of the Trident-Engine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hadn't the Trident era already ended when Edge appeared? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft created the Edge browser in 2015, what they really did was to fork Trident into EdgeHTML and to strip out plenty of legacy code paths like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX&quot;&gt;ActiveX&lt;/a&gt; (Microsoft's version of Java Applets) or emulation of older IE rendering engines. Both browsers sharing the same genes gets apparent when you read posts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/04/19/modernizing-dom-tree-microsoft-edge/&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; on the Edge Blog or when you see bug reports that &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T203564&quot;&gt;similarly affect IE 11 as well as Edge 17&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/8932/internet-explorer-project-spartan-shows-large-performance-gains&quot;&gt;Most of the initial Edge improvements came from Chakra&lt;/a&gt;, the JavaScript engine, whereas only a moderate few &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5test.com/compare/browser/ie-11/edge-12.html&quot;&gt;could be attributed to the rendering engine itself&lt;/a&gt;. Renaming the browser could be considered more of a marketing move, though, as the removal of legacy features already started earlier, when the browser was still called Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebooting Internet Explorer under a new name didn't win back the hearts of the web developers. Up until today Microsoft remained busy playing catch up. Therefore, when we get excited about the web platform nowadays, it is not because of a new Edge release but because of Google unveiling new ideas or APIs during Google I/O or the Chrome Dev Summit. A lot of these innovations are driven by other teams at Google working on Google frameworks like Angular and AMP, or on Google products like Gmail, Search, Drive, Maps, Google Docs, Analytics or in recent times: Lighthouse. In fact, a lot of what defines HTML5 can be rooted back to Google looking for a way to improve the web platform to better accommodate its ideas around web apps. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_(software)&quot;&gt;Google Gears&lt;/a&gt;? Or later &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_Frame&quot;&gt;Google Chrome Frame&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily that same kind of process also drove innovation in Internet Explorer in the old days. ActiveX capability was added to Internet Explorer 3.0, together with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, to offer one more &quot;compile target&quot; for Microsoft's own Java competitor. It was certainly not the IE team that came up with this idea. Or take what we know today as &quot;AJAX&quot;: the idea of lazily fetching content in the background via JavaScript was born in the Exchange / Outlook Web Access team, a product that could be seen as a precursor to Gmail. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20070227195930/http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm&quot;&gt;After pulling a few tricks inside Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; they got it (silently) shipped with Internet Explorer 5.0 in 1999. It wasn't until 6 years later that &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20050222032831/http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php&quot;&gt;the term AJAX was coined&lt;/a&gt; and its concepts became widely known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we pretty quickly struck a deal to ship the thing as part of the MSXML library. Which is the real explanation of where the name XMLHTTP comes from- the thing is mostly about HTTP and doesn't have any specific tie to XML other than that was the easiest excuse for shipping it so I needed to cram XML into the name (plus- XML was the hot technology at the time and it seemed like some good marketing for the component).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/designMode&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;document.designMode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (apparently a wish coming &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-internet-explorer-shaped-the-internet-5937354&quot;&gt;from the Hotmail team&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/contentEditable&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;contentEditable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-internet-explorer-shaped-the-internet-5937354&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html&quot;&gt;Drag-n-Drop API&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#iframe&quot;&gt;iframes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://depth-first.com/articles/2011/01/24/reading-and-writing-the-sytem-clipboard-in-javascript-copy-and-paste-molfiles-in-chemwriter-on-internet-explorer/&quot;&gt;Clipboard Access&lt;/a&gt;. Internet Explorer was also the first browser to have permission prompts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://schepp.dev/img/chemwriter_clipboard_prompt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Clipboard Access Permission Prompt&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the days, Microsoft was single-handedly pushing the web forward, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html&quot;&gt;with around 1.000(!) people working on Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_version_history#Microsoft_Internet_Explorer_5&quot;&gt;with a 100 million dollar budget to burn per year&lt;/a&gt;, with almost no-one left to compete. This was massive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Scott] Isaac also invented the iframe HTML tag. It has been speculated that the tag name stands for the Isaacs Frame, although Scott has denied this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time Internet Explorer introduced new features driven by other business units was in 2012. At that time Windows 8 introduced the Windows Store and corresponding Windows Store Apps. Those apps could be written once and could then be run on Windows, Xbox and Windows Phone. Since Microsoft was late to the app store game, they had to put the entry barrier for developing apps as low as possible, so they got the idea of allowing people to develop apps with web technologies. As a communication path to the underlying OS, they created a JavaScript library called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinJS&quot;&gt;WinJS&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and Internet Explorer 10 was meant to be the runtime environment for those apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://schepp.dev/img/metro.png&quot; alt=&quot;Metro Design - Microsoft, Public Domain&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be able to model the Windows UI with web technologies, Microsoft had to add plenty of new capabilities to IE: CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, CSS Scroll Snap Points and the Pointer Events API for touch and stylus interactions (the latter one was required as &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=vb4v9HNwWVgC&amp;amp;pg=PA569&amp;amp;lpg=PA569&amp;amp;dq=internet+explorer+pointer+events+patent&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=dlEPaUbP6_&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U2I08YKVq1fPg5RTHcGC169SyOrEQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5l4zggtvmAhVPyqQKHS0dACUQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=internet%20explorer%20pointer%20events%20patent&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Apple had filed a patent on the Touch API&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft even invented what later became &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md&quot;&gt;Origin Trials&lt;/a&gt;, as documented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://workingdraft.de/211/&quot;&gt;a podcast interview we did with Jacob Rossi from the Edge team in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to my introductory part on ancient civilizations and their achievements: For me, it feels like Internet Explorer already had many of the things that we came to reinvent later and that we now celebrate as innovations. Although our modern reinventions offer more features combined with better developer experience, I came to wonder why we, as a community, only picked up very few of them. The ones mentioned above were picked up - either because browsers were striving for compatibility with IE or because Microsoft was at the right time at the right place. But a lot more were not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-forgotten-parts&quot;&gt;The Forgotten Parts &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#the-forgotten-parts&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mhtml&quot;&gt;MHTML &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#mhtml&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one on the list is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML&quot;&gt;MHTML&lt;/a&gt;. MHTML or &quot;MIME encapsulation of aggregate HTML documents&quot; was meant as a packaging format. It shared a lot of concepts with how email clients append attachments to an email. MHTML would take an HTML file and inline all of its resources like CSS, JavaScript files or images via base64 into extra sections. So it was basically data URIs, but on steroids. You could also see MHTML as the precursor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/web-bundles/&quot;&gt;Web Bundles&lt;/a&gt;. The format was supported from IE 5 onwards, as well as in Presto-based Opera. No other browser officially supported MHTML, but Chromium added the feature later behind a flag called &lt;code&gt;chrome://flags/#save-page-as-mhtml&lt;/code&gt;. MHTML was &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2557&quot;&gt;proposed as an open standard to the IETF&lt;/a&gt; but somehow it never took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact: Did you know that Outlook Express used MHTML inside the &lt;code&gt;.eml&lt;/code&gt; email message files, which it used to store emails together with their corresponding attachments on your disk?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;page-transition-filters&quot;&gt;Page Transition Filters &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#page-transition-filters&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer had page transition filters which you would define as HTTP header or in the form of a meta tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;meta&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;http-equiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Page-Enter&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;RevealTrans(Duration=0.600, Transition=6)&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It the name implies, such a filter would smoothly transition the user from page to page upon navigation, instead of having pages appear as abruptly as we are used to. There was an extensive list of transition filters you could choose from by referencing them via number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;multicolumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0 - Box in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 - Box out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 - Circle in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 - Circle out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 - Wipe up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 - Wipe down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 - Wipe right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 - Wipe left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 - Vertical blinds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 - Horizontal blinds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 - Checkerboard across&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 - Checkerboard down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 - Random dissolve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13 - Split vertical in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14 - Split vertical out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15 - Split horizontal in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 - Split horizontal out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17 - Strips left down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18 - Strips left up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19 - Strips right down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 - Strips right up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 - Random bars horizontal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22 - Random bars vertical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 - Any random pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;code&gt;Page-Enter&lt;/code&gt; you could specify additional transitions for &lt;code&gt;Page-Exit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Site-Enter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Site-Exit&lt;/code&gt;. Those soft transitions between pages are something that we see reappearing in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/hands-on-portals/&quot;&gt;Portals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;object-transition-filters&quot;&gt;Object Transition Filters &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#object-transition-filters&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to how you could use filters to transition between pages, you could also transition between two states of the same DOM object. This is similar to Rich Harris' &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Rich-Harris/ramjet&quot;&gt;ramjet&lt;/a&gt;, only that it would not morph between two states, but instead blend over with a movie-like &quot;cut&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you could also do with those object transition filters is something similar to CSS Transitions or to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://schepp.github.io/imagery-on-the-web/#/4/13&quot;&gt;animated CSS crossfade() function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would start off with applying a blend filter to the element (with a duration of 600ms):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;filter &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'blendTrans(duration=0.600)'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, before making any change to the object, you would freeze its current state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;filters&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;blendTrans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally you would change the image source and trigger the transition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'different-src.jpg'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;filters&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;blendTrans&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;effects-filters&quot;&gt;Effects Filters &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#effects-filters&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filter category most people still remember from Internet Explorer 4+ is effects filters. In 1997 they already offered, although in a lower fidelity, what CSS Filters brought to the table when they first appeared in 2012 in Apple Safari 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://schepp.dev/img/ie-grey-filter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the grey filter in Internet Explorer 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also use Internet Explorer's Matrix Filter &lt;a href=&quot;http://extremelysatisfactorytotalitarianism.com/blog/?p=1002&quot;&gt;to do things&lt;/a&gt; that would later be introduced by CSS Transforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;15deg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;progid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;DXImageTransform.Microsoft.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M11=0.9659258262890683&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M12=-0.2588190451025207&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M21=0.2588190451025207&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M22=0.9659258262890683&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SizingMethod=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'auto expand'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, you could use the Chroma Filter to key out certain color pixels of an element in order to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.der-schepp.de/chroma-corners/&quot;&gt;create rounded corners&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130118094658/https://thenittygritty.co/css-masking&quot;&gt;to apply masking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gradient-filter&quot;&gt;Gradient Filter &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#gradient-filter&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always though Internet Explorer 10 was the first version to support gradients? Not entirely true, there was a CSS filter for that, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;progid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;DXImageTransform.Microsoft.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;enabled=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'false'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;startColorstr=#550000FF&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; endColorstr=#55FFFF00&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note how Internet Explorer already supported 8-digit hex codes for RGBA colors, something that only officially appeared in CSS around 2016 as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hex-notation&quot;&gt;CSS Color Module Level 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer first introduced custom scrollbar styling back in 1999 and it wasn't until 2013 that Safari came up with its own mechanic of styling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;box-sizing&quot;&gt;Box-Sizing &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#box-sizing&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer initially implemented the box model as if &lt;code&gt;box-sizing: border-box&lt;/code&gt; was set by default. Event though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jefftk.com/p/the-revenge-of-the-ie-box-model&quot;&gt;many people found Microsoft's take a lot more logical and user friendly&lt;/a&gt;, the CSS WG ultimately chose another default where &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; was not referring to the outer width of a box but to width of the usable content space inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://schepp.dev/img/450px-W3C_and_Internet_Explorer_box_models.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;W3C and IE Box Models compared, courtesy of Wikipedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically, a box is measured from border to border. Take a physical box, any box. Put something in it that is distinctly smaller than the box. Ask anyone to measure the width of the box. He'll measure the distance between the sides of the box (the 'borders'). No one will think of measuring the content of the box. Web designers who create boxes for holding content care about the &lt;em&gt;visible&lt;/em&gt; width of the box, about the distance from border to border. The borders, and not the content, are the visual cues for the user of the site. Nobody is interested in the width of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only with IE 6 that Microsoft added an additional browser rendering mode, this time sticking to the standards. It was not active by default so not to mess old layouts up. You had to opt-in to it, which you would do by &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170531195606/http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/quirksmode.html&quot;&gt;starting your HTML document with a doctype declaration&lt;/a&gt; (think of it as JavaScript's &lt;code&gt;use strict;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays everyone goes back to IE's model by starting off their CSS with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/&quot;&gt;resetting the box sizing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; border-box&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;*, *::before, *::after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;box-sizing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; inherit&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;css-expressions&quot;&gt;CSS Expressions &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#css-expressions&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until version 7, Internet Explorer had a great feature called &quot;CSS Expressions&quot;, also known as &quot;Dynamic Properties&quot;. In essence, they were JavaScript snippets wrapped in a CSS function and what the snippet evaluated to went into the CSS property's value. They could be considered as one precursor of CSS Houdini and CSS'es &lt;code&gt;calc()&lt;/code&gt; function and other functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could for example script your own &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Math.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;this.parentElement.clientWidth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 400&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'px'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code would set the width of the element to the width of the parent until it exceeds 400px. Then it would stop there, similarly to how &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; works. The &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword would refer to the current element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since IE only supported pseudo-elements from version 8 on, you could use CSS Expressions to &quot;polyfill&quot; these, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;zoom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this.runtimeStyle.zoom = &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;insertBefore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;document.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'span'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;this.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;hasChildNodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;? this.childNodes[0]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; null&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.className=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'before'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;this.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;document.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'span'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.className=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'after'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code above is assigned to a more or less irrelevant CSS property: &lt;code&gt;zoom&lt;/code&gt;. The first thing it would do is to disable further executions of the expression by replacing it with a static value of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. This stops it from creating more and more elements with every new evaluation run. Then it creates &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements which it injects at the beginning and end of its content area, with the CSS class names &lt;code&gt;.before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.after&lt;/code&gt;. Since Internet Explorer 8 was the first version to support pseudo-elements but at the same time dropped support for CSS Expressions, the above code would do no damage in pseudo-element aware browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason CSS Expressions were dropped so early from IE was that they quickly acquired themselves a bad image. And that was because with CSS Expressions you could quickly tank a website's rendering performance, bringing it to a crawl. The &quot;problem&quot; with CSS Expressions was that they executed after every single event that the browser registered, which also included &lt;code&gt;resize&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scroll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mousemove&lt;/code&gt;. Have a look at the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'#'&lt;/span&gt;+Math.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Math.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;*16777216&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;16&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code would randomly calculate a HEX color which would then be assigned as background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how the background color updates every time one moves the mouse? This is indeed bad for performance, which is why leading figures in the web development scene soon started &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.de/books?id=jRVlgNDOr60C&amp;amp;pg=PA51&amp;amp;lpg=PA51&amp;amp;dq=%22avoid+css+expressions%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=pcA1Hw2ai4&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U1bDcBGz1ivaBIMf6U3jPZk35aSfw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUvo-1op3nAhXHKVAKHR9hBpcQ6AEwB3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22avoid%20css%20expressions%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;advising against using them&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnyman.com/2007/11/13/stop-using-poor-performance-css-expressions-use-javascript-instead/&quot;&gt;or to replace them with real JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;. Back in the days, though, only a few were really versed at writing JavaScript, including me. Nowadays I would argue that it all depends on how you write your code and that you can equally create badly performing code in JavaScript. One solution to the problem is the one shown in the pseudo-element code, where the expression disables itself after the first run by assigning a static value to &lt;code&gt;this.style&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;this.runtimeStyle&lt;/code&gt; (which is another proprietary Microsoft thing representing a style object with even higher precedence in the CSS cascade than inline styles). If the value was meant to stay dynamic, you could modify the code to only do costly calculations when it was supposed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why not just use plain JavaScript? Well, it's true that you can do all of these things with pure JavaScript. One thing though, that I find super handy about expressions, is that they are easier to invoke on many different sorts of elements, as you can use CSS (selectors) to assign them to elements. And in the case of the pseudo-element polyfill expression it makes even more sense to have it your CSS as that's also the place where you would create real pseudo-elements. So it depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fonts&quot;&gt;Fonts &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#fonts&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer was also the first browser to allow the use of custom fonts. The corresponding &lt;code&gt;@font-face&lt;/code&gt; rule was part of CSS 2.0 but got pulled out of CSS 2.1 as browser support was too bad. Microsoft continued to support it and paired it with a new file format, which they developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html&quot;&gt;together with the font foundry Monotype&lt;/a&gt;: the Embedded OpenType (EOT) format. EOT was meant to tackle these problems from two directions. On the one side, authoring tools, like Microsoft's Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT), would only accept source fonts that were not marked with a &lt;code&gt;no embedding&lt;/code&gt; flag. That way font foundries could disallow the use of them on the web. On the other side, during creation, you would specify a list of allowed URLs for the font to be used on and the browser would then check against it and only display the font if the current URL was indeed listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Monotype &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/01/Comment&quot;&gt;submitted EOT to be standardized to the W3C in 2008&lt;/a&gt;. But ultimately, the other browser makers of that time decided not to implement it, as it didn't use the (then) commonly supported GZIP algorithm for compression, but a proprietary algorithm called &quot;MicroType Express&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html&quot;&gt;which they didn't want to implement on top&lt;/a&gt;. So instead they asked the W3C to develop yet another font embedding format, but based on GZIP, which in 2010 appeared as the WOFF format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than embed the URL of a document in the font, it relies on an HTTP feature (the origin header), which allows to give the domain part of a document's URL: less precise than a full URL, but still good enough for most font makers. In the end, however, WOFF still adopted parts of EOT's MicroType Express algorithm, and a new compression algorithm (Brotli), because it allowed better compression than gzip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fun fact: Did you know that when you embed fonts into a Powerpoint 2007 or 2010 presentation that Powerpoint would embed that font as an EOT file in the corresponding &lt;code&gt;.pptx&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as 1998, Microsoft already suggested techniques that come close to what we celebrate today as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Houdini&quot;&gt;CSS Houdini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components&quot;&gt;Web Components&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLComponents&quot;&gt;HTML Components&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of HTML with scripting as an application platform has exploded recently. One limiting factor of this growth is that there is no way to formalize the services that an HTML application can provide, or to allow them to be reused as components in another HTML page or application. HTML Components address this shortcoming; an HTML Component (HTC for short) provides a mechanism for reusable encapsulation of a component implemented in HTML, stylesheets and script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Componentization is a powerful paradigm that allows component users to build applications using 'building blocks' of functionality without having to implement those building blocks themselves, or necessarily understand how the building works in fine detail. This method makes building complex applications easier by breaking them down into more manageable chunks and allowing the building blocks to be reused in other applications. HTML Components brings this powerful development method to Web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Microsoft's work &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mecheye.net/2017/08/introduction-to-html-components/#comment-632830&quot;&gt;was considered prior art in the early Web Component discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first browser to implement HTML Components was Internet Explorer 5 in 1999 and the last one was Internet Explorer 9 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were three kinds of HTML Components: &lt;strong&gt;Attached Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Element Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Default Behaviors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;attached-behaviors&quot;&gt;Attached Behaviors &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#attached-behaviors&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached Behaviors worked similarly to a CSS Houdini Worklet in that you had a (&lt;code&gt;.htc&lt;/code&gt;) file which would add new capabilities to any element it was attached to. The attaching itself was done via CSS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token url&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;roll.htc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.htc&lt;/code&gt; files consisted of special XML markup used to connect with the outside world, and a script block which would define how the element would behave. The attached DOM element was exposed to the script as the &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt; global. The following Attached Behavior is tailored for image elements and would change their source every time the mouse would hover over them (hat tip for his deep dive and and credit for all of the following examples goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mecheye.net/2017/08/introduction-to-html-components/&quot;&gt;Jasper St. Pierre&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;attach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;onmouseover&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;onevent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;rollover()&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;attach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;onmouseout&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;onevent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;rollout()&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; originalSrc &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rollover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;rollover-&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; originalSrc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rollout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; originalSrc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;element-behaviors&quot;&gt;Element Behaviors &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#element-behaviors&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Element Behaviors went one step further by not only outsourcing behavior into a &lt;code&gt;.htc&lt;/code&gt; file but also markup, thereby creating a custom element. This is pretty similar to Web Components' &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements&quot;&gt;Custom Elements&lt;/a&gt; which also look trivial from the outside, from the &quot;Light DOM&quot;, but hide a complex DOM structure inside in their Shadow DOM. Microsoft's version of Shadow DOM is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//ms531428(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN&quot;&gt;&quot;Viewlink&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, into which you can opt-in, and like Shadow DOM it will protect the inner structure from any document styles bleeding in or from external scripts manipulating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewlink is a feature of element behaviors that enables you to write fully encapsulated Dynamic HTML (DHTML) behaviors and import them as robust custom elements in a Web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use Element Behaviors it wasn't enough anymore to use CSS to tie an HTML element to a behavior. Instead you had to leverage the power of XML by creating a new namespace for your custom components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token doctype&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;xmlns:&lt;/span&gt;custom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;?import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;custom&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;RollImgComponent.htc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;custom&lt;/code&gt; is a XML namespace name which you could freely chose. It could also be something else. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?import&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag does what we previously used CSS for: to refer to a &lt;code&gt;.htc&lt;/code&gt; file holding the code for that component. In the &lt;code&gt;.htc&lt;/code&gt; file, you then needed to add a few more parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You needed to define the custom HTML tag under which to use the element: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;public:component tagname=&quot;rollimg&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to define any HTML attributes this element allowed for, e.g.: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;public:property name=&quot;src&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And you needed to add the inner markup of your element similarly to today's &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;template&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tagname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;rollimg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;attach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;onmouseover&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;image&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; img &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;all&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'image'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;id &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rollover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;rollover-&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rollout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that within the &lt;code&gt;.htc&lt;/code&gt; file you had your own scoped &lt;code&gt;document&lt;/code&gt; object to traverse.&lt;br/&gt;Now you were ready to go to use your custom element in your HTML markup like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;custom:&lt;/span&gt;rollimg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;logo.png&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom elements like these were synchronously parsed and created. After the creation of the above example component the page's DOM would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;custom:&lt;/span&gt;rollimg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;logo.png&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;logo.png&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;custom:&lt;/span&gt;rollimg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; elements became visible and could therefore be targeted from with the HTML document via DOM traversal or CSS. Which may not have been what you wanted. To fix that, you needed to activate Internet Explorer's version of Shadow DOM called &quot;viewLink&quot;, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;tagname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;rollimg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;attach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;onmouseover&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;onevent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;rollover()&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;attach&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;onmouseout&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;onevent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;rollout()&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;image&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token script&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;defaults&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;viewLink &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; img &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;all&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'image'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rollover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;rollover-&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rollout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;img&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;default-behaviors&quot;&gt;Default Behaviors &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#default-behaviors&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Behaviors are the third variant of HTML Components. They are basically standard libraries built into the browser that you could tap into via CSS or XML extension and that unlocked a completely new set of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;triggering-a-download&quot;&gt;Triggering a Download &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#triggering-a-download&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them was &lt;code&gt;behavior:url(#default#download)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays when you want to trigger a download just from within the front-end, what you would do is make use of a link with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#download&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;download&lt;/code&gt; attribute&lt;/a&gt; and execute &lt;code&gt;.click()&lt;/code&gt; on it. Well, back in the old days it went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;download&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token style-attr language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token url&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;#default#download&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;onclick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;download.startDownload('menu.pdf')&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Download&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;persisting-data&quot;&gt;Persisting Data &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#persisting-data&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another super useful Default Behavior was &lt;code&gt;behavior: url(#default#userData)&lt;/code&gt;. It solves the same problems as &lt;code&gt;localStorage&lt;/code&gt; does, just in a completely different manner. The following illustrates how to save and restore the values of input elements in old IE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token style&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token language-css&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token selector&quot;&gt;#store&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is even &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/mmurph211/4271685&quot;&gt;localStorage polyfills for IE&lt;/a&gt; that use this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Default Behavior is the Client Capabilities Behavior. As the name already hints at, it allows you to find out more about the client. The most interesting piece of information is the one about the user's connection type, similar to today's &lt;code&gt;navigator.offline&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API&quot;&gt;Network Information API&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think Internet Explorer could not animate stuff? Not entirely true. Because, back in the days there was already SMIL, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language&quot;&gt;Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language&lt;/a&gt;. SMIL is a markup language to describe multimedia presentations, defining markup for timing, layout, animations, visual transitions, and media embedding. While Microsoft was heavily involved in the creation of this new W3C standard, they ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20091206034833/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1998/07/13478&quot;&gt;decided against implementing it in Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. What they did, though, was to derive from it a dialect that would integrate with HTML and submitted that to W3C, too: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML%2BTIME&quot;&gt;HTML+TIME&lt;/a&gt;, the Timed Interactive Multimedia Extensions. The W3C later reworked it into something that became part of SMIL 2.0 and that was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML%2BSMIL&quot;&gt;XHTML+TIME&lt;/a&gt;. Internet Explorer 5 was the first browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms533099(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN&quot;&gt;to support it&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 in version 1.0. Internet Explorer 5.5 one year later supported HTML+TIME version 2.0, the implementation of which was closer to W3C's XHTML+TIME draft. Microsoft still held on to the old name without a leading X, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature was also encapsulated in a Default Behavior which you had to activate first, either by CSS or by extending the (XML) namespace. Afterwards, what you could do with it was e.g. to show and hide elements over the course of ten seconds, five times in a row:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, switching to the XML namespace variant, you could animate HTML attributes like the background color of the body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you could embed a video or audio in HTML, similarly to how you use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; nowadays, and even have accessible HTML controls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All formats were supported for which the underlying Windows operating system found an appropriate decoder. By default those were for example MPEG-1 and AVI encoded with Microsoft Video-1 codec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You find the demo &lt;a href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/demos/internet-explorer/smil-video.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You'll need a (&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/ie6.xp.virtualbox&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/a&gt;) machine with IE 5.5-8 to experience the IE implementation which you see in the above video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;vector-markup-language&quot;&gt;Vector Markup Language &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#vector-markup-language&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft were also the first to support a vector graphics format in a browser in 1999: the Vector Markup Language, in short VML. VML was developed by Autodesk, Hewlett-Packard, Macromedia, Microsoft, and Vision and submitted to the W3C in 1998. Unfortunately, around that same time, the W3C also received a competing submission called Precision Graphics Markup Language (PGML) and developed by Adobe Systems and Sun Microsystems. So W3C merged both proposals and created the Scalable Vector Graphics format (SVG) in 2001. The first browser to support SVG was Konqueror 3.2 in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there isn't much to complain about VML, other than that it could only be used embedded into an HTML file, not externally referenced. Here is how you would create an ellipse both in SVG as well as in VML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both dialects look similar and seem equally unfamiliar to us web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-binding&quot;&gt;Data Binding &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#data-binding&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back since Internet Explorer 4.0 in 1997 you could embed data sources into your document. This could be done by referencing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/archive/blogs/dhejo_vanissery/using-tabular-data-control-to-display-csv-files&quot;&gt;external CSV file&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;classid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;clsid:333C7BC4-460F-11D0-BC04-0080C7055A83&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;DataURL&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;data.csv&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a CSV file you could also &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms531386(v=vs.85)&quot;&gt;establish a connection to your database server&lt;/a&gt; (not suggested in writing mode :):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;classid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;clsid:BD96C556-65A3-11D0-983A-00C04FC29E33&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Server&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;http://server&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Connect&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;dsn=database;uid=guest;pwd=&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;param&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;SQL&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;select name from people&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note how the &lt;code&gt;classid&lt;/code&gt; attribute changes depending on the type of data.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally you could also reference an external XML file via &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xml&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;http://localhost/xmlFile.xml&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…or use embedded inline XML in HTML as your data source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token prolog&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That inlined XML was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5243/xml-data-island&quot;&gt;&quot;XML Data Islands&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and it worked similarly to how browsers nowadays handle SVG embedded in HTML or HTML embedded into an SVG &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;foreignObject&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; by switching to another parser on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An XML data island is an XML document residing within an HTML page. This avoids having to write code (i.e. a script) just to load the XML document, or having to load it through a tag. Client side scripts can directly access these XML data islands. These XML data islands can be bound to HTML elements also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you had the data in your page you could use Internet Explorer's data binding to e.g. edit it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;datasrc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;#data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;datafld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-way-data-binding&quot;&gt;2-way Data Binding &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#2-way-data-binding&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only could you bind data to an input, but also to arbitrary elements. And you could create a two-way data flow, just with declarative markup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason there is &lt;code&gt;onkeyup=&quot;this.blur();this.focus()&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is to trigger data flow after each key press, as otherwise the other connected elements would only receive the updated value &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the user left the input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer also shipped with a native data grid implementation that you hooked up to the above data sources and which is built on top of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. This was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms531358(v=vs.85)&quot;&gt;Tabular Data Control&lt;/a&gt;. You would use the HTML attributes &lt;code&gt;datafld&lt;/code&gt; to map data fields to table columns, &lt;code&gt;dataformatas&lt;/code&gt; to enable or disable HTML entity encoding of the contained data, and the &lt;code&gt;datapagesize&lt;/code&gt; attribute to denote how many entries a page of the grid should show at once. And then there were the methods &lt;code&gt;previousPage&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;nextPage&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;firstPage&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lastPage&lt;/code&gt; to easily navigate through the pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer featured an interesting &lt;code&gt;propertychange&lt;/code&gt; event, which you could attach to DOM elements and which would trigger each time a property of it would change programmatically. This could have happened via &lt;code&gt;setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; or via object property access. This allowed to create observed/instrumented objects for similar use cases you could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-proxies-in-depth&quot;&gt;ES Proxies&lt;/a&gt; nowadays. All you needed was a dummy DOM element with &lt;code&gt;propertychange&lt;/code&gt; event applied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;key&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'value2'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resize-events-for-dom-elements&quot;&gt;Resize Events for DOM Elements &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#resize-events-for-dom-elements&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer had plenty of unique events, but the most interesting one is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/aa769560(v=vs.95)&quot;&gt;element based &lt;code&gt;resize&lt;/code&gt; event&lt;/a&gt;, available up until IE 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The onresize event fires for block and inline objects with layout, even if document or CSS (cascading style sheets) property values are changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is basically in relation to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resize_Observer_API&quot;&gt;Resize Observer&lt;/a&gt; what mutation events are to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver&quot;&gt;Mutation Observer&lt;/a&gt;. With the only difference to the usual events in that it triggered asynchronously, similarly to an observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;element&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;onresize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;javascript-preloading&quot;&gt;JavaScript Preloading &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#javascript-preloading&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting implementation of Internet Explorer was how it would load and execute JavaScript sources added via script. The code for that is the one we all know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; script &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;createElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'script'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; head &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'head'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;src &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'...'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;head&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;appendChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How other browser did it was to fetch and execute such a script in the moment it was appended to the DOM. Internet Explorer had a more clever approach: it splitted up both steps. Fetching happened as soon as the &lt;code&gt;.src&lt;/code&gt; property was assigned whereas execution only happened once the script was appended to the DOM. That way you could easily preload scripts without blocking the main thread. Something developers could only implement in a more complicated fashion in other browser, at least until we got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/optimization-performance-resource-hints/&quot;&gt;Resource Hints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer was also the first browser to introduce the &lt;code&gt;defer&lt;/code&gt; attribute for scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-the-currently-executing-script&quot;&gt;Finding the currently executing script &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#finding-the-currently-executing-script&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the HTML5 standard introduced &lt;code&gt;document.currentScript&lt;/code&gt; which pointed to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element which was currently being executed. Why would you need this? For example to read out &lt;a href=&quot;https://2ality.com/2014/05/current-script.html&quot;&gt;extra configuration&lt;/a&gt; like this one in the &lt;code&gt;data-main&lt;/code&gt; attribute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;scripts/require.js&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token attr-name&quot;&gt;data-main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token attr-value&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;js/main&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token tag&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere inside &lt;code&gt;scripts/require.js&lt;/code&gt; there would be this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; main &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;currentScript&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'data-main'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this only got implemented in Edge 12. What only a few people knew was that Internet Explorer had another mechanism in place which not only offered the same result, but that was also more in line with how a document would communicate if it was still loading or if it was fully interactive: scripts had a &lt;code&gt;.readyState&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;currentScript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; scripts &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'script'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; scripts&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;scripts&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;readyState &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'interactive'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; scripts&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.readyState&lt;/code&gt; property was dropped in Internet Explorer 11 which made this version the only one supporting neither &lt;code&gt;.currentScript&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;.readyState&lt;/code&gt; (luckily, a genius named &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/millea9&quot;&gt;Adam Miller&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amiller-gh/currentScript-polyfill&quot;&gt;found another way to polyfill it&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-led-to-ie's-downfall%3F&quot;&gt;So what led to IE's downfall? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://schepp.dev/posts/today-the-trident-era-ends/#so-what-led-to-ie's-downfall%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the above list, I would say that Microsoft was lightyears ahead of everyone else in regards to providing tools and solutions for architecting complex and delightful websites. Some syntax may look unfamiliar to us, but this is just because we are not used to it. Back in the days, XML was all the rage. And remember how you felt when you opened an SVG for the first time? Or when you saw ES6'es arrow notation? Or BEM? JSX? You probably had the same feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of why Microsoft's ideas didn't really catched on was that we developers just didn't get it. Most of us were amateurs and had no computer degree. Instead we were so busy learning about semantic markup and CSS that we totally missed the rest. And finally, I think too few people back then were fluent enough in JavaScript, let alone in architecting complex applications with JavaScript to appreciate things like HTML Components, Data Bindings or Default Behaviors. Not to speak of those weird XML sprinkles and VML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason could have been a lack of platforms to spread knowledge to the masses. The internet was still in its infancy, so there was no MDN, no Smashing Magazine, no Codepen, no Hackernoon, no &lt;a href=&quot;http://Dev.to&quot;&gt;Dev.to&lt;/a&gt; and almost no personal blogs with articles on these things. Except &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmonkey&quot;&gt;Webmonkey&lt;/a&gt;. There were also no conferences yet, where Microsoft devrel people could have spoken. And there was also no broadband and therefore no conference talks you could have watched on video. All there was, was mailing lists like &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_List_Apart&quot;&gt;A List Apart&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and IRC to get in contact with others, which was basically Slack, but with a lot less polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final nail in the coffin was that after the release of Internet Explorer 6, Microsoft decided to tightly couple new Internet Explorer releases to Windows releases. So they &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Timeline&quot;&gt;dismantled the Internet Explorer team&lt;/a&gt; and integrated it into the Windows product team. Sadly, the Windows version in the making, Windows XP's successor with codename &quot;Longhorn&quot; (later Windows Vista), got massively delayed as development was so unfocused and chaotic that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista#Development_reset&quot;&gt;they even needed to reset it&lt;/a&gt;. This also delayed a new Internet Explorer release and left the web in a vacuum, with no one fixing bugs and improving existing technology. When Microsoft woke up five years later, it was already too late. W3C had developed new standards and the remaining other browser makers not only implemented them but also founded the WHATWG which brought even more innovations to the table. Microsoft lost its technical leadership, lost its market share, and never recovered from that period.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Linode launches free DDoS protection</title>
<link>https://www.linode.com/press_release/linode-launches-free-advanced-ddos-protection-across-its-global-network/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linode.com/press_release/linode-launches-free-advanced-ddos-protection-across-its-global-network/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powerful combination of automated threat technology and expansive mitigation capacity can block or defer large scale DDoS attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILADELPHIA, January 24, 2020 —&lt;/strong&gt; Linode, the world’s largest independent cloud provider, today announced advanced protection across its global network of 11 data centers to mitigate the impact of pervasive and costly distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Like it has done with other critical services, Linode is making this additional layer of protection free for every one of its customers, no matter how big or small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing levels of DDoS attacks at every layer of the Internet have made DDoS protection a mandatory first line of defense for businesses running workloads in the cloud. These attacks have caused hundreds of billions of dollars in economic loss globally and remain a significant challenge for many cloud providers and their customers. Linode has been responding to these ongoing threats by investing heavily in building out advanced DDoS mitigation capabilities that today represent one of the most advanced network protection measures in the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DDoS attacks are a clear and present danger for anyone doing business in the cloud today,” said Dan Spataro, Director of Infrastructure at Linode. “We’ve invested heavily in the capacity to mitigate these attacks across our global network and built the predictive technologies necessary to automatically detect and neutralize threats at our network edge before they can impact service. Coupled with our soon to be released Cloud Firewall solution, we’re giving customers the enhancements they need to scale with confidence.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumetric attacks are the most common type of DDoS attack, the virtual equivalent to intentionally causing a traffic-jam by flooding a highway with more cars than it can handle. Linode’s advanced DDoS protection has the capacity to withstand attacks larger than any seen in the industry to date, with no increased latency and no routing of a customer’s traffic to a third party, by applying real-time behavioral algorithms that detect and block volumetric traffic before it reaches a customer’s infrastructure. When a threat is detected, Linode blocks the attack inline, then distributes the increased traffic across its global fiber backbone. The new capability was designed to further minimize any impact to a customer’s services by addressing a broad range of DDoS attack methods, including UDP, SYN, HTTP floods, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.linode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/advanced-ddos-Artboard-1@2x-1064x516.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-12059&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.linode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/advanced-ddos-Artboard-1@2x-1064x516.png 1064w, https://www.linode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/advanced-ddos-Artboard-1@2x-632x307.png 632w, https://www.linode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/advanced-ddos-Artboard-1@2x-416x202.png 416w, https://www.linode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/advanced-ddos-Artboard-1@2x-768x372.png 768w, https://www.linode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/advanced-ddos-Artboard-1@2x-1536x745.png 1536w, https://www.linode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/advanced-ddos-Artboard-1@2x-2048x993.png 2048w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1064px) 100vw, 1064px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of advanced DDoS mitigation sets Linode apart from other alternative cloud providers that charge for or do not offer this level of protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Linode has been known for the quality and performance of the network it has built over the past 16 years,” said Liam Eagle, research vice president at 451 Research. “Continuing to add capabilities like DDoS protection is how smaller, customer focused cloud providers are giving developers and the companies they work for viable alternatives to the large public cloud providers.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About Linode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linode accelerates innovation by making cloud computing simple, accessible, and affordable to all. Founded in 2003, Linode helped pioneer the cloud computing industry and is today the largest independent open cloud provider in the world. Headquartered in Philadelphia’s Old City, the company empowers more than a million developers, startups, and businesses across its global network of 11 data centers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google backtracks on search results design</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/google-backtracks-on-search-results-design/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/google-backtracks-on-search-results-design/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1220768238490939394?s=21&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be redesigning the redesign of its search results as a response to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/&quot;&gt;withering criticism from politicians, consumers and the press&lt;/a&gt; over the way in which search results displays were made to look like ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google makes money when users of its search service click on ads. It doesn’t make money when people click on an unpaid search result. Making ads look like search results makes Google more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a pretty evil (or at least unethical) business decision by a company whose mantra was “Don’t be evil”(although &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393&quot;&gt;they gave that up in 2018&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users began noticing the changes to search results last week, and at least one user flagged the changes earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;7.3983050847458&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;9.0423728813559&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There's something strange about the recent design change to google search results, favicons and extra header text: they all look like ads, which is perhaps the point? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TlIvegRct1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/TlIvegRct1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Craig Mod (@craigmod) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/craigmod/status/1219644556003565568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 21, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google responded with a bit of doublespeak from its corporate account about how the redesign was intended to achieve the opposite effect of what it was actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last year, our search results on mobile gained a new look. That’s now rolling out to desktop results this week, presenting site domain names and brand icons prominently, along with a bolded ‘Ad’ label for ads,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) took a break from impeachment hearings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2020/01/24/the-technology-202-nonprofit-expands-free-security-services-for-campaigns-as-election-season-heats-up/5e29d43688e0fa6ea99d342d/&quot;&gt;to talk to The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; about just how bad the new search redesign was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen multiple instances over the last few years where Google has made paid advertisements ever more indistinguishable from organic search results,” Warner told the Post. “This is yet another example of a platform exploiting its bottleneck power for commercial gain, to the detriment of both consumers and also small businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s changes to its search results happened despite the fact that the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/forty-nine-states-and-the-district-of-columbia-are-pushing-an-antitrust-investigation-against-google/&quot;&gt;is already being investigated by every state in the country&lt;/a&gt; for antitrust violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Google, the rationale is simple. The company’s advertising revenues aren’t growing the way they used to, and the company is looking at a slowdown in its core business. To try and juice the numbers, dark patterns present an attractive way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Google’s using the same tricks that it once battled to become the premier search service in the U.S. When the company first launched its search service, ads were clearly demarcated and separated from actual search results returned by Google’s algorithm. Over time, the separation between what was an ad and what wasn’t became increasingly blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Search results were near-instant and they were just a page of links and summaries – perfection with nothing to add or take away,” user experience expert Harry Brignull (and founder of the watchdog website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darkpatterns.org/&quot;&gt;darkpatterns.org&lt;/a&gt;) said of the original Google search results in an interview with TechCrunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The back-propagation algorithm they introduced had never been used to index the web before, and it instantly left the competition in the dust. It was proof that engineers could disrupt the rules of the web without needing any suit-wearing executives. Strip out all the crap. Do one thing and do it well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As Google’s ambitions changed, the tinted box started to fade. It’s completely gone now,” Brignull added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company acknowledged that its latest experiment might have gone too far in its latest statement and noted that it will “experiment further” on how it displays results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;8.2981927710843&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;10.481927710843&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Here’s our full statement on why we’re going to experiment further. Our early tests of the design for desktop were positive. But we appreciate the feedback, the trust people place in Google, and we’re dedicating to improving the experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gy9PwcLqHj&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gy9PwcLqHj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Rough.js v4.0 – hand-drawn, sketchy graphics</title>
<link>https://roughjs.com/posts/release-4.0/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://roughjs.com/posts/release-4.0/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create graphics with a hand-drawn, sketchy, appearance&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;/header&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Release v4.0.0 (January 13th, 2020)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first release of Rough.js in about 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not seem like a big release, but it is significant in a couple of ways. Firstly, this is the first time since the library's inception, the core rendering algorithms have been modified. Secondly, for a change, I have removed something from the library in addition to adding some functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random number seeding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many users had asked for this feature. Rough.js computes shapes by generating a lot of random offsets. As a result, every render creates a unique hand-drawn looking shape. There are cases, however, where this is not the desired behavior and the application may want to persist the shape even at different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API now allows the user to pass in a seed value which is used to generate a predictable sequence of random numbers. Providing the seed is optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; seed &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; rough&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;newSeed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;rc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; fill&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'red'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; seed &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;rc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; fill&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'blue'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; seed &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://roughjs.com/images/posts/release-4.0/r1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seeded square sample&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this image above, notice the two squares have the same outlines, even though they are rendered separately with different sizes and fill colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Hachure Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough.js can a fill a shape with hachure lines. These lines are also used in creating other fill styles like &lt;em&gt;cross-hatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;zigzag&lt;/em&gt;, etc. The old algorithm was adapted from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gicentre.net/software/#/handy/&quot;&gt;Handy's&lt;/a&gt; processing code with minor changes. The code was a bit convoluted, and it did not handle concave shapes very well at some hachure angles, creating cases like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://roughjs.com/images/posts/release-4.0/r2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Concave polygon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new algorithm is similar in nature and is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.mun.ca/av/old/teaching/cg/notes/raster_poly.pdf&quot;&gt;Scan-line rasterization algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. To create hachure lines, the scan lines are incremented in steps based on the specified &lt;code&gt;hachureGap&lt;/code&gt;. This algorithm, however, is designed for horizontal scan-lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve various hachure angles, I first rotate the shape itself by the &lt;code&gt;hachureAngle&lt;/code&gt;. Then I calculate the horizontal scan-lines for the rotated shape. The computed lines are then rotated back by &lt;code&gt;-hachureAngle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://roughjs.com/images/posts/release-4.0/r3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Concave polygon process&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new algorithm resulted in half the lines of code, and performs about 20% faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dynamic roughness estimation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of creating the sketchy look is to create imperfect artifacts that are generated by randomizing certain parameters. Some of these parameters get exagerated based on the shape and the random values that are generated. So a shape with a roughness value of &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; looked more like a roughness value of &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; at a different size. This was particularly noticable when drawing ellipses where the relationship is quadartic. In the image below, notice the circles have the same shape, but the outer circles look more &lt;em&gt;rough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://roughjs.com/images/posts/release-4.0/r4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Concentric circles&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The algorithm now auto-adjusts itself based on the size of the shape. Following is the same set of circles generated with auto-adjust&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://roughjs.com/images/posts/release-4.0/r5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Concentric circles&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No-stroke fills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature, often requested was to add ability to draw shapes without the outline. This was achieved by setting the stroke color to &lt;code&gt;transparent&lt;/code&gt;. This does the job, but the underlying shape still has the extra instruction to draw the outline. If the sroke is set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, then the outline is not computed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;rc&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rectangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;250&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; stroke&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'none'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; fill&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;'blue'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://roughjs.com/images/posts/release-4.0/r8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;no-stroke square&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why 4.0 and not 3.x?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for upgrading to a major version was the it is strictly not backwards compatible and the location and names of the bundled resources have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;web-worker&lt;/code&gt; version of rough.js is not built anymore because it can be created by the app using roughjs generator object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;code&gt;sunburst&lt;/code&gt; style of filling shapes has been removed from the API. It was not popular and had several corner cases where it did not work.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Clayton Christensen has died</title>
<link>https://www.deseret.com/faith/2020/1/24/21079323/clayton-christensen-harvard-disruptive-innovation-lds-mormon</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.deseret.com/faith/2020/1/24/21079323/clayton-christensen-harvard-disruptive-innovation-lds-mormon</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;BTtrxD&quot;&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Clayton Christensen, whose theory of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/disruptive-innovation-2/&quot;&gt;disruptive innovation&lt;/a&gt; made him a key influence on Silicon Valley powerhouses like Netflix and Intel and twice earned him the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2013/11/17/20529798/mormon-professor-named-world-s-top-management-thinker-delivers-emotional-speech&quot;&gt;the world’s most influential living management thinker&lt;/a&gt;, died Jan. 23 at age 67.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JnDi73&quot;&gt;His brother, Carlton, told the Deseret News that Christensen died Thursday evening of complications from cancer in Boston, Massachusetts, where he had been a notable part of the Latter-day Saint community for over 40 years. He was considered an equally robust spiritual thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;DP5cZ3&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;8qd6M4&quot;&gt;Christensen introduced disruptive innovation in the Harvard Business Review &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave&quot;&gt;in 1995&lt;/a&gt;, but the theory and the term burst into the public consciousness in 1997 when he published “The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail.” Soon afterward, Intel CEO Andy Grove stood up with a copy of the book at COMDEX in Las Vegas and declared it the most important book he’d read in a decade. The two men appeared together on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0125/6302088a.html#1d9183b05c86&quot;&gt;cover of Forbes magazine&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 — and both Christensen and the business world were changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RuS3uz&quot;&gt;Christensen initially used the term “disruptive technologies.” Grove dubbed it the “Christensen Effect.” After Christensen altered it to “disruptive innovation,” the term became ubiquitous. Five years ago, the Economist said it had long since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/01/25/what-disruptive-innovation-means&quot;&gt;entered the zeitgeist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JIYoze&quot;&gt;Though he coined the term, Christensen grew uncomfortable with it as he saw it overused and misapplied. He utilized it narrowly to describe innovations that upended existing markets, but only if they fit a certain pattern he had discovered. A true disruptive innovation, he taught, first appealed only to a niche market and appeared less attractive than the powerful incumbent it eventually usurped. In fact, the incumbent typically looked down on it as inconsequential until it ate up huge swaths of its market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dN7ALL&quot;&gt;Netflix CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/13/netflix-why-att-bought-time-warner-and-comcast-and-disney-want-fox.html&quot;&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; “The Innovator’s Dilemma” with his team. The biographer of Steve Jobs said the book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2011/10/what-did-steve-jobs-read/&quot;&gt;deeply influenced”&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s co-founder. Jeff Bezos &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2013/10/jeff-bezos-read-these-books/&quot;&gt;tells&lt;/a&gt; his Amazon executives to read another Christensen book, “The Innovator’s Solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tnGlh9&quot;&gt;A masterful storyteller, Christensen was a perfect fit for Harvard’s case study method and the way CEOs thought and acted. He shared his case studies with roomfuls of CEOs. His story about the disruption of steel mills gripped Grove, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;K9fpxd&quot;&gt;Christensen’s timing was perfect, according to an exhaustive New Yorker profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0lRdHf&quot;&gt;“It was the turn of the millennium, dot-com businesses were springing up all over the place, Digital Equipment Corporation, a giant of the computer age, was disintegrating, and AOL was suddenly and inexplicably worth as much as Time Warner,” the author wrote. “Obviously, everybody had to be on guard, but against what? Into this chaos and uncertainty came Christensen, telling his story about the steel industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DZt4Nz&quot;&gt;Grove applied that story to help Intel ward off a disruption that could have undone the company. He did what flocks of CEOs would, bringing Christensen in to speak to vast teams at Intel. Grove then identified low-end personal computers as a potential disruptive innovation that threatened the high-end computer chip maker, and he instructed his managers and sales team to focus on them. Soon, Intel introduced the cheaper Celeron chip. Within a year, Intel owned 35% of the market share for chips in cheaper personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fmzw81&quot;&gt;Grove, who died in 2016, credited Christensen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k8Ap17&quot;&gt;“Clay created a way of thinking that gave others the tools and the framework to discover things that had never been thought of before, to see things they could never have seen on their own,” said Clark Gilbert, a Christensen protegé and president of BYU-Pathway Worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vSIJZR&quot;&gt;Christensen died nearly a month after Gary Starkweather, the man whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-starkweather-invented-a-laser-printer-at-xerox-11579024691&quot;&gt;idea for the laser printer&lt;/a&gt; made Xerox a powerhouse. Eventually, the powerhouse printer company became the subject of another Christensen story on a disrupted industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b4znyn&quot;&gt;“We were heartbroken to learn today of the passing of Clayton Christensen,” said Nitin Nohria, dean of the Harvard Business School, in a statement shared Friday with the Deseret News. “His loss will be felt deeply throughout our community. Clayton’s brilliance and kindness were equally evident to everyone he met, and his legacy will be long-lasting. Through his research and teaching, he fundamentally shaped the practice of business and influenced generations of students and scholars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6MmizX&quot;&gt;Disruptive innovation became a ubiquitous term. Cable channels produced “disruptor lists.” Some observers said the term’s use added sophistication to any discussion. Others complained it was overused. Various forms of it regularly pop up in discussions about sports, for example. To his chagrin, users often apply it as a synonym for anything new or transformative, not understanding Christensen’s actual theory. The ubiquity worried him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;adNFeE&quot;&gt;“If we call every business success a ‘disruption,’ then companies that rise to the top in very different ways will be seen as sources of insight into a common strategy for succeeding,” he once said. “This creates a danger: Managers may mix and match behaviors that are very likely inconsistent with one another and thus unlikely to yield the hoped-for result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0tg2P3&quot;&gt;He second-guessed the wording of the label, but never the theory. Even after he changed his terminology to disruptive innovation, he saw flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bTWrWZ&quot;&gt;“What we didn’t anticipate, and what in many ways was a fault of mine,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/801706/innovation-guru-clayton-christensens-new-theory-will-help-protect-you-from-disruption/&quot;&gt;he told Quartz&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, “was that the term disruption has so many different connotations in the English language, that it allows people to justify whatever they want to do as, ‘Oh, this is disruptive,’ and they don’t ever read the book. The population of people where the fewest have read the book are venture capitalists. They are arrogant and smart and why do they need to read something?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yd8Jiy&quot;&gt;He wished he’d created something less expressive. He began to discuss type 1 innovations and type 2 innovations, with a nod to Daniel Kahneman, because he believed those terms were vague enough to force people to read and understand his work more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VgXM3b&quot;&gt;“The misconception around the term is that it’s an innovation or technology that somehow is simply new and cutting edge, in the sense of that no one’s ever done it before,” said Gilbert, a former president of the Deseret News. “But a disruptive technology most often innovates in a way that looks inferior. A disruptive innovation appears inferior to incumbents and underperforms on traditional measures. Then the innovation evolves and actually opens up a whole new category of consumption to users and consumers who could never have consumed it before because it was either too expensive, or required too much expertise to consume. Many think it means newer, better, faster, but what Clay actually found was that a disruptive innovation doesn’t appear as a better product but as one that makes it more accessible or more affordable to a much wider audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QdisNX&quot;&gt;Grove told Christensen he mislabeled his theory. Instead of innovative technologies, Grove suggested, Christensen should have used “crummy technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2vjOkC&quot;&gt;“A disruptive innovation looks inferior,” Gilbert said, “but only to the incumbent organizations. Then it opens up the ability to consume something that never would have been possible without the innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yZTclL&quot;&gt;Whatever the name, the theory itself galvanized Silicon Valley and Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;R7lcFd&quot;&gt;Apple’s Jobs regularly quoted “The Innovator’s Dilemma.” It received the Global Business Book Award in 1997 and the Economist named it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/06/30/aiming-high&quot;&gt;one of the six best business books&lt;/a&gt; ever published. Three years ago, Quartz.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/801706/innovation-guru-clayton-christensens-new-theory-will-help-protect-you-from-disruption/&quot;&gt;called Christensen&lt;/a&gt; “possibly the most influential management thinker in Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PyEtBP&quot;&gt;Criticism occasionally stung Christensen. However, he used it to fuel refinements to his theory, on which he never stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GMRQf5&quot;&gt;“There are criticisms that are very important,” he &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/801706/innovation-guru-clayton-christensens-new-theory-will-help-protect-you-from-disruption/&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; one interviewer. “Never does a theory just pop out in complete form. But rather, the first appearance of the theory is half-baked. Then it improves when people say, ‘it doesn’t account for this,’ or ‘this is an anomaly and it doesn’t explain that.’ It’s very important to have people willing to criticize it for that purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;e4hbB0&quot;&gt;He created the Clayton Christensen Institute for Disruptive Innovation to continue refining his life’s work. He also founded Rose Park Advisors to invest in companies based on his theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zSB1Q1&quot;&gt;The final dozen years of his life were marked by health concerns. In 2007, he suffered a heart attack. In late 2009, he was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. While speaking in a church meeting in 2010, he suffered a stroke that left him with expressive aphasia. The storyteller still could think and reason but no longer had the ability to direct his mouth to express the words in his head. He worked ceaselessly and successfully to relearn how to speak, but he had trouble finding words the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GBFJ7g&quot;&gt;Carlton Christensen said his brother had been under treatment for leukemia for the past year, a rare result of his previous cancer treatment. He was hospitalized Jan. 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oU7xi4&quot;&gt;In 2012, after Thinkers50 ranked him the world’s most influential living management thinker for the first time, The New Yorker published an 8,800-word profile titled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/14/when-giants-fail&quot;&gt;When Giants Fail&lt;/a&gt;.” The title referred to the corporate titans taken down by disruptive innovations, but Christensen, too, was a giant at 6-foot-8. The New Yorker author referred to his height in the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZQnhS4&quot;&gt;His work will outlast him. Just last week, Forbes published an article titled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlesbeames/2020/01/15/its-our-choice-solve-the-innovators-dilemma-or-perish/#154648395ed9&quot;&gt;It’s Our Choice, Solve the Innovator’s Dilemma or Perish&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Nru64z&quot;&gt;The regular use of disruption was illustrated last month when The Wall Street Journal published a special section reviewing the last decade under the banner headline “Decade of Disruption.” The story could have referred to Christensen because his continued work remained dominant. Thinkers50 released global rankings of management thinkers four times between 2011 and 2017; Christensen finished first, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2013/11/17/20529798/mormon-professor-named-world-s-top-management-thinker-delivers-emotional-speech&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;, second and third. The final time, the list called him “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thinkers50.com/media/thinkers50-ranking-of-management-thinkers-announced/&quot;&gt;the disruptive guru&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;94L7V1&quot;&gt;Michael Horn, who co-founded the Clayton Christensen Institute, said it would remain committed to his legacy and continue his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UMulGZ&quot;&gt;“Clay leaves behind an incredible tree of researchers and acolytes and practitioners who will continue to not only spread what he learned in his lifetime but also continue to improve the theory, ultimately, and not only that theory but the other theories that Clay developed,” Horn said. “Clay was someone who believed that a theory was something you could continue to improve as more information and more understanding of the world came into view, and ideas shouldn’t stand still, in effect. It was more important get truth than be right. He leaves behind a whole slew of people, not just at the institute, but around the world, like Bob Moesta (CEO of the Re-Wired Group), Scott Anthony (Innosight), Clark Gilbert and others who will continue to perfect the ideas and put them into action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jTDvtV&quot;&gt;Christensen applied his innovation theory to self-help in a book titled, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://deseretbook.com/p/ppr-how-will-you-measure-your-life?variant_id=152408-paperback&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6fn-mLqa5wIVEb7ACh2egg8bEAQYASABEgIAavD_BwE&quot;&gt;How Will You Measure Your Life&lt;/a&gt;?” It began as a speech to the Class of 2010 at the Harvard Business School. The Harvard Business Review printed a version &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/05/08/the-most-important-decision-of-your-life-you-make-every-day/#2d8a270d32aa&quot;&gt;to acclaim&lt;/a&gt;. He gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvos4nORf_Y&quot;&gt;a TEDx Talk on the subject&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XvVmTr&quot;&gt;The Harvard Business Review’s online version carries an editor’s note that says, “Though Christensen’s thinking comes from his deep religious faith, we believe that these are strategies anyone can use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;erMXUK&quot;&gt;Gilbert said his mentor had a unique capacity to bridge spiritual and secular dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pNppqF&quot;&gt;“People who didn’t believe in God or who weren’t religious found themselves reflecting on spiritual ideas because of the conversations and writings of Clay Christensen. ‘How Will You Measure Your Life’ influenced so many people,” Gilbert said. “He had this ability to unapologetically and with deep conviction and courage talk about things of faith and of God with people who didn’t think they were religious. He found ways of not only engaging them personally but engaging them intellectually in a way that caused them to start to really actually think about spiritual matters in a way that they never would have without someone like Clay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zwSMli&quot;&gt;Born in the Rose Park area west of the railroad tracks in Salt Lake City, Christensen as a child read the World Book Encyclopedia from A to Z. He served as a missionary in Korea for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1971 to 1973. After he completed a bachelor’s degree from BYU, he earned a master’s as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England, followed by an MBA and later a doctorate at Harvard. He had been a professor in the business school since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Oo4ny1&quot;&gt;In addition to 10 books on business, he wrote about his Latter-day Saint faith, which he summed up in a document called, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://claytonchristensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Why_I_Belong_and_Why_I_Believe.pdf&quot;&gt;Why I Belong, and Why I Believe&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ns6Aor&quot;&gt;His book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2012/12/26/20511635/clayton-christensen-hopes-the-power-of-everyday-missionaries-spurs-discussion-about-member-missionar#clayton-m-christensen-is-the-kim-b-clark-professor-of-business-administration-at-the-harvard-business-school-at-heart-he-also-sees-himself-as-a-missionary-for-the-lds-church&quot;&gt;The Power of Everyday Missionaries: The What and How of Sharing the Gospel&lt;/a&gt;” is a popular work on the topic. He was a driving force behind and wrote the foreword for Kristen Smith Dayley’s book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2012/12/22/20511535/for-all-the-saints-shares-lessons-of-faith-and-testimony-for-latter-day-saints&quot;&gt;For All the Saints&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Does Your Domain Have a Registry Lock?</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/01/does-your-domain-have-a-registry-lock/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/01/does-your-domain-have-a-registry-lock/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re running a business online, few things can be as disruptive or destructive to your brand as someone stealing your company’s domain name and doing whatever they wish with it. Even so, most major Web site owners aren’t taking full advantage of the security tools available to protect their domains from being hijacked. Here’s the story of one recent victim who was doing &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; everything possible to avoid such a situation and still had a key domain stolen by scammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 23, 2019, unknown attackers began contacting customer support people at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openprovider.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OpenProvider&lt;/a&gt;, a popular domain name registrar based in The Netherlands. The scammers told the customer representatives they had just purchased from the original owner the domain &lt;strong&gt;e-hawk.net&lt;/strong&gt; — which is part of a service that helps Web sites detect and block fraud — and that they were having trouble transferring the domain from OpenProvider to a different registrar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real owner of e-hawk.net is &lt;strong&gt;Raymond Dijkxhoorn&lt;/strong&gt;, a security expert and entrepreneur who has spent much of his career making life harder for cybercrooks and spammers. Dijkxhoorn and E-HAWK’s &lt;strong&gt;CEO Peter Cholnoky&lt;/strong&gt; had already protected their domain with a “&lt;strong&gt;registrar lock&lt;/strong&gt;,” a service that requires the registrar to confirm any requested changes with the domain owner via whatever communications method is specified by the registrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of e-hawk.net, however, the scammers managed to trick an OpenProvider customer service rep into transferring the domain to another registrar with a fairly lame social engineering ruse — and without triggering any verification to the real owners of the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the thieves contacted OpenProvider via &lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/strong&gt;, said they were now the rightful owners of the domain, and shared a short screen grab video showing the registrar’s automated system blocking the domain transfer (see video below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wmc57l1FRuo&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The support agent helpfully tried to verify if what the [scammers] were saying was true, and said, ‘Let’s see if we can move e-hawk.net from here to check if that works’,” Dijkxhoorn said. “But a registrar should not act on instructions coming from a random email address or other account that is not even connected to the domain in question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkxhoorn shared records obtained from OpenProvider showing that on Dec. 23, 2019, the e-hawk.net domain was transferred to a reseller account within OpenProvider. Just three days later, that reseller account moved e-hawk.net to another registrar — &lt;a href=&quot;https://publicdomainregistry.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Public Domain Registry&lt;/a&gt; (PDR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the previously silent move to another reseller account within OpenProvider, we were not notified by the registrar about any changes,” Dijkxhoorn said. “This fraudulent move was possible due to successful social engineering towards the OpenProvider support team. We have now learned that after the move to the other OpenProvider account, the fraudsters could silently remove the registrar lock and move the domain to PDR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;REGISTRY LOCK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkxhoorn said one security precaution his company had not taken with their domain prior to the fraudulent transfer was a “&lt;strong&gt;registry lock&lt;/strong&gt;,” a more stringent, manual (and sometimes offline) process that effectively neutralizes any attempts by fraudsters to social engineer your domain registrar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a registry lock in place, your registrar cannot move your domain to another registrar on its own. Doing so requires manual contact verification by the appropriate domain registry, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verisign.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Verisign&lt;/a&gt; — which is the authoritative registry for all domains ending in .com, .net, .name, .cc, .tv, .edu, .gov and .jobs. Other registries handle locks for specific top-level or country-code domains, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nominet.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Nominet&lt;/a&gt; (for .co.uk or .uk domains), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurid.eu/fr/bureaux-denregistrement/devenez-un-bureau-denregistrement-eu/registry-lock&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;EURID&lt;/a&gt; (for .eu domains), CNNIC for (for .cn) domains, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data provided by digital brand protection firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cscglobal.com/service/csc/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CSC&lt;/a&gt;, while domains created in the top three most registered top-level domains (.com, .jp and .cn) are eligible for registry locks, &lt;em&gt;just 22 percent of domain names tracked in Forbes’ list of the World’s Largest Public Companies have secured registry locks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not all registrars support registry locks (a list of top-level domains that do allow registry locks is &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XjuE0VZdIS3gUJ8t4bpPjhP4SV6WAg0AyALPN_Uxe94/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of CSC). But as we’ll see in a moment, there are other security precautions that can and do help if your domain somehow ends up getting hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkxhoorn said his company first learned of the domain theft on Jan. 13, 2020, which was the date the fraudsters got around to changing the domain name system (DNS) settings for e-hawk.net. That alert was triggered by systems E-HAWK had previously built in-house that continually monitor their stable of domains for any DNS changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, this continuous monitoring of one’s DNS settings is a powerful approach to help blunt attacks on your domains and DNS infrastructure. Anyone curious about why this might be a good approach should have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/a-deep-dive-on-the-recent-widespread-dns-hijacking-attacks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this deep-dive from 2019 on “DNSpionage,”&lt;/a&gt; the name given to the exploits of an Iranian group that has successfully stolen countless passwords and VPN credentials from major companies via DNS-based attacks.&lt;span id=&quot;more-50236&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;DNSSEC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after pointing e-hawk.net’s DNS settings to a server they controlled, the attackers were able to obtain at least one encryption certificate for the domain, which could have allowed them to intercept and read encrypted Web and email communications tied to e-hawk.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that effort failed because E-HAWK’s owners also had enabled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DNSSEC&lt;/a&gt; for their domains (a.k.a. “DNS Security Extensions”), which protects applications from using forged or manipulated DNS data by requiring that all DNS queries for a given domain or set of domains be digitally signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With DNSSEC properly enabled, if a name server determines that the address record for a given domain has not been modified in transit, it resolves the domain and lets the user visit the site. If, however, that record has been modified in some way or doesn’t match the domain requested, the name server blocks the user from reaching the fraudulent address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While fraudsters who have hijacked your domain and/or co-opted access to your domain registrar can and usually will try to remove any DNSSEC records associated with the hijacked domain, it generally takes a few days for these updated records to be noticed and obeyed by the rest of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, having DNSSEC enabled for its domains bought E-HAWK an additional 48 hours or so with which to regain control over its domain before any encrypted traffic to and from e-hawk.net could have been intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, E-HAWK was able to wrest back its hijacked domain in less than 48 hours, but only because its owners are on a first-name basis with many of the companies that manage the Internet’s global domain name system. Perhaps more importantly, they happened to know key people at PDR — the registrar to which the thieves moved the stolen domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dijkxhoorn said without that industry access, E-HAWK probably would still be waiting to re-assume control over its domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This process is normally not that quick,” he said, noting that most domains can’t be moved for at least 60 days after a successful transfer to another registrar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, &lt;strong&gt;OpenProvider CEO and Founder&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Arno Vis&lt;/strong&gt; said said OpenProvider is reviewing its procedures and building systems to prevent support employees from overriding security checks that come with a registrar lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are building an extra layer of approval for things that support engineers shouldn’t be doing in the first place,” Vis said. “As far as I know, this is the first time something like this has happened to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in this case, crooks who specialize in stealing domains often pounce during holidays, when many registrars are short on well-trained staff. But Vis said the attack against E-HAWK targeted the company’s most senior support engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is why social engineering is such a tricky thing, because in the end you still have a person who has to make a decision about something and in some cases they don’t make the right decision,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;WHAT CAN YOU DO?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, for maximum security on your domains, consider adopting some or all of the following best practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use registration features like Registry Lock that can help protect domain name records from being changed. Note that this may increase the amount of time it takes going forward to make key changes to the locked domain (such as DNS changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use DNSSEC (both signing zones and validating responses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use access control lists for applications, Internet traffic and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Use 2-factor authentication, and require it to be used by all relevant users and subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In cases where passwords are used, pick unique passwords and consider password managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Review the security of existing accounts with registrars and other providers, and make sure you have multiple notifications in place when and if a domain you own is about to expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Monitor the issuance of new SSL certificates for your domains by monitoring, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.certificate-transparency.org/how-ct-works&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Certificate Transparency Logs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
