<title>Thinkpad X210</title>
<link>https://geoff.greer.fm/2019/03/04/thinkpad-x210/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://geoff.greer.fm/2019/03/04/thinkpad-x210/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoff.greer.fm/2017/01/23/oldest-viable-laptop/&quot;&gt;I used an old Thinkpad while my MacBook was being repaired&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed the experience so much that &lt;a href=&quot;https://geoff.greer.fm/2017/07/16/thinkpad-x62/&quot;&gt;I ended up getting a Thinkpad X62&lt;/a&gt; (an X61 chassis with modern internals). Last September, the maker of the X62 announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/lcdfans/posts/2144170785850022&quot;&gt;a 3rd batch of X210s would be made&lt;/a&gt;. I ordered one and received it in January. China has a bunch of laws that make it hard to move money across borders, so payment involved wiring $1200 to someone’s personal bank account in China, then e-mailing a qq.com address. It was a rather harrowing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://geoff.greer.fm/images/x210.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My X210. Fonts are huge so that you can read screenfetch.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the X62, the X210 is made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/lcdfans&quot;&gt;51NB&lt;/a&gt;, a group of enthusiasts in Shenzhen. The X210 is an X201 chassis with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://ark.intel.com/products/122589/Intel-Core-i7-8550U-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4-00-GHz-&quot;&gt;Core i7 8550u&lt;/a&gt; (4 cores, turbo boost up to 4GHz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2× DDR4 SODIMM slots. I put 32 GB of RAM in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2× mini PCI Express slots. There’s an 802.11/Bluetooth card in one. The other is empty but could be used for LTE or a second wireless card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An M.2 NVMe slot. I put a 2TB SSD in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 3.5” SATA bay. I left it empty, but it’s possible to put a second SSD in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An upgraded screen (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.panelook.com/NV126A1M-N52_BOE_12.6_LCM_overview_28762.html&quot;&gt;12.6 inch, 2880×1920, 450 nits, wide gamut&lt;/a&gt;). The bezel is cut to make room for the 3:2 aspect ratio. There is no webcam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini DisplayPort &amp;amp; VGA out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3× USB 3.1 ports (no USB-C).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SD card reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gigabit ethernet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical switch to toggle Wifi/Bluetooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headphone &amp;amp; microphone jacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal microphone &amp;amp; speakers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X210 is sold as either a motherboard that you install into your own chassis or as a barebones laptop where you bring your own RAM, SSD, and battery. I got the barebones kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-impressions&quot;&gt;My Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slightly prefer the X62’s more compact keyboard, but everything else is much better on the X210. The CPU is over twice as fast and runs cooler. The wifi is faster. The SSD is faster. The screen is &lt;em&gt;gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;. it’s a 12.6” screen with a higher resolution than the 15” MacBook Pro. Overall, it’s just plain better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux worked out of the box. I had to install non-free drivers for the Broadcom wireless card, then tweak a few module options to get better power saving. Battery life is a little over 4 hours with the flush battery (55Wh) and 6-7 hours with the extended battery (80Wh). I haven’t finished tweaking all the power saving options, so the lowest idle state is PC3. Battery life would increase by 50% if I got PC6 or PC8 idle states. The fan only turns on if I’m doing something intensive like compiling go or scrolling in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most older Thinkpads, the X210 is easily repaired and upgraded. You can swap the battery in seconds without any tools. If the SSD fails, you can replace it. If the RAM fails, you can replace it. If the wifi card fails, you can replace it. If the screen fails, you can replace it. You can even replace the Trackpoint and the little rubber feet without much trouble. The laptop can be entirely disassembled with two Philips screwheads (#0 and #1). At no point do you encounter tape, glue, or pentalobe screws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The X210 isn’t perfect. It’s made by a group of enthusiasts, not a big company. With that comes some disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Like the X62, the mini DisplayPort cannot output in HDMI alternate mode. This means that miniDP→HDMI dongles won’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sometimes notice &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation&quot;&gt;PWM&lt;/a&gt; flicker on the screen. This only happens at the lowest brightness in a dark room when displaying mostly black content. I can see afterimages when my eyes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade&quot;&gt;saccade&lt;/a&gt;, similar to some brake lights at night. It’s about as noticeable as the PWM flicker on my iPhone X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the motherboard breaks, you can’t walk into a store and get it replaced or repaired. Your only recourse is to e-mail the manufacturer and ship it back to China. I’ve only read about one case of this happening, and in that case the motherboard was DOA. The unfortunate user was shipped a new one within a few weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this laptop. It addresses almost all of the issues I had with the X62: better screen, better performance, and better microphone quality. More than anything, the X210 demonstrates just how much potential is being squandered by laptop manufacturers. If a small group in Shenzhen can make this laptop, Lenovo or Apple should be able to build something far better. Instead they make laptops with integrated batteries, fewer ports, soldered RAM, sub-par keyboards, and touchbars. Many professionals want something better.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:hn&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope 51NB continues to build new internals for old chassis, because I doubt the major laptop manufacturers will get their heads out of their asses any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Suse is once again an independent company</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/suse-is-once-again-an-independent-company/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/suse-is-once-again-an-independent-company/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Open-source infrastructure and application delivery vendor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suse.com/&quot;&gt;Suse&lt;/a&gt; — the company behind one of the oldest Linux distributions — today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suse.com/c/news/suse-completes-move-to-independence-reaffirms-commitment-to-customers-partners-and-open-source-communities-as-industrys-largest-independent-open-source-company/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it is once again an independent company. The company today finalized its $2.5 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suse.com/c/news/suse-partners-with-growth-investor-eqt-to-continue-momentum-strategy-execution-and-product-expansion/&quot;&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; by growth investor EQT from Micro Focus, which itself had acquired it back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few companies have changed hands as often as Suse and yet remained strong players in their business. Suse was first acquired by &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/novell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;novell&quot;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. Novell was then acquired by &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/attachmate-corporation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;attachmate-corporation&quot;&gt;Attachmate&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, which &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/micro-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;micro-focus&quot;&gt;Micro Focus&lt;/a&gt; acquired in 2014. The company then turned Suse into an independent division, only to then announce its sale to &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/eqt-holdings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;eqt-holdings&quot;&gt;EQT&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while for Micro Focus and EQT to finalize the acquisition, though, but now, for the first time since 2004, Suse stands on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micro Focus &lt;a href=&quot;http://otp.investis.com/clients/uk/microfocus/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=108&amp;amp;newsid=1240634&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that when it acquired Attachmate Group for $2.35 billion, Suse generated just 20 percent of the group’s total revenues. Since then, Suse has generated quite a bit more business as it expanded its product portfolio well beyond its core Linux offerings and into the more lucrative open-source infrastructure and application delivery business by, among other things, offering products and support around massive open-source projects like Cloud Foundry, OpenStack and Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-1797808&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;196&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; srcset=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/suse_logo_w-tag_color.png?resize=50,31 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px&quot;/&gt;Suse CEO Nils Brauckmann will remain at the helm of the company, but the company is shaking up its executive ranks a bit. Enrica Angelone, for example, has been named to the new post of CFO at Suse, and Sander Huyts is now the company’s COO. Former Suse CTO Thomas Di Giacomo is now president of Engineering, Product and Innovation. All three report directly to Brauckmann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our genuinely open, open source solutions, flexible business practices, lack of enforced vendor lock-in and exceptional service are more critical to customer and partner organizations, and our independence coincides with our single-minded focus on delivering what is best for them,” said Brauckmann in today’s announcement. “Our ability to consistently meet these market demands creates a cycle of success, momentum and growth that allows &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/suse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;suse&quot;&gt;SUSE&lt;/a&gt; to continue to deliver the innovation customers need to achieve their digital transformation goals and realize the hybrid and multi-cloud workload management they require to power their own continuous innovation, competitiveness and growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/story/ibm-acquires-red-hat/&quot;&gt;IBM recently bought Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; for $34 billion, though, it remains to be seen how long Suse’s independent future will last. The market for open source is only heating up, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>As Costs Skyrocket, More U.S. Cities Stop Recycling</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Recycling, for decades an almost reflexive effort by American households and businesses to reduce waste and help the environment, is collapsing in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Philadelphia is now burning about half of its 1.5 million residents’ recycling material in an incinerator that converts waste to energy. In Memphis, the international airport still has recycling bins around the terminals, but every collected can, bottle and newspaper is sent to a landfill. And last month, officials in the central Florida city of Deltona faced the reality that, despite their best efforts to recycle, their curbside program was not working and suspended it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Those are just three of the hundreds of towns and cities across the country that have canceled recycling programs, limited the types of material they accepted or agreed to huge price increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We are in a crisis moment in the recycling movement right now,” said Fiona Ma, the treasurer of California, where recycling costs have increased in some cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Prompting this nationwide reckoning is China, which until January 2018 had been a big buyer of recyclable material collected in the United States. That stopped when Chinese officials determined that too much trash was mixed in with recyclable materials like cardboard and certain plastics. After that, Thailand and India started to accept more imported scrap, but even they are imposing new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The turmoil in the global scrap markets &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/climate/recycling-landfills-plastic-papers.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;began affecting American communities last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the problems have only deepened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;With fewer buyers, recycling companies are recouping their lost profits by charging cities more, in some cases four times what they charged last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Amid the soaring costs, cities and towns are making hard choices about whether to raise taxes, cut other municipal services or abandon an effort that took hold during the environmental movement of the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Into the truck in Sunrise. “Recycling has been dysfunctional for a long time,” said Mitch Hedlund, executive director of Recycle Across America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott McIntyre for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Recycling has been dysfunctional for a long time,” said Mitch Hedlund, executive director of Recycle Across America, a nonprofit organization that pushes for more standardized labels on recycling bins to help people better sort material. “But not many people really noticed when China was our dumping ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Perhaps counterintuitively, the big winners appear to be the nation’s largest recyclers, like Waste Management and Republic Services, which are also large trash collectors and landfill owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Recycling had been one of the least lucrative parts of their business, trailing hauling and landfills. Analysts say many waste companies had historically viewed recycling as a “loss leader,” offering the service largely to win over a municipality’s garbage business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;That equation is starting to change. While there remains a viable market in the United States for scrap like soda bottles and cardboard, it is not large enough to soak up all of the plastics and paper that Americans try to recycle. The recycling companies say they cannot depend on selling used plastic and paper at prices that cover their processing costs, so they are asking municipalities to pay significantly more for their recycling services. Some companies are also charging customers additional “contamination” fees for recycled material that is mixed in with trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The higher recycling fees, analysts say, will help bolster the largest companies’ already booming businesses. Waste Management reported strong operating profits in 2018, while Republic reported increased revenue driven by its waste business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Most of the industry’s landfill increases were driven by economic growth: The more Americans consume, the more garbage they generate. But at least some of the higher volume were recyclables that could not be sold and repurposed, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some municipal leaders say they are growing wary of companies that control virtually every aspect of the waste and recycling system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Are these contamination rates truly high, or is it about benefiting their corporate interest?” asked Mike Ryan, the mayor of Sunrise, Fla. “We can’t afford to have inspectors constantly looking over their shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Sunrise's mayor, Mike Ryan, said of the shift to energy-generating incineration: &quot;It’s not what most people think of as recycling, but it is better than the alternative.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott McIntyre for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Unable to afford the higher costs, Sunrise decided to burn its recycling in a facility that turns waste into energy rather than send it to a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“It’s not what most people think of as recycling, but it is better than the alternative,” Mr. Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;For cities like Philadelphia, recycling had long been a point of pride. Over the last decade, Philadelphia went from having one of the lowest recycling rates among big cities to one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When China was buying cardboard and plastics, recycling made money for the city some years. But last year, Philadelphia was hit with an “outrageously high” price increase, a city spokeswoman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The city came up with what it says will be a temporary solution. It identified the neighborhoods with the most contamination in its recycling bins and started sending their material to an incinerator in nearby Chester, Pa. The rest still send their material to a recycling facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The incinerator converts the waste to energy, which can be sold back to the electrical grid, said Carlton Williams, Philadelphia’s streets commissioner. But that has done little to alleviate many residents’ environmental angst and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://amp.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/21/philadelphia-covanta-incinerator-recyclables-china-ban-imports&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concerns about increased air pollution&lt;/a&gt; in Chester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Residents say, ‘You are taking all our recycling efforts, and you are burning it?’” Mr. Williams said. “They hear the word ‘burn’ and they think it is an environmental disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;City officials are working to negotiate a more affordable contract that would restore recycling to all of Philadelphia this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In Deltona, higher costs were not the only factor behind the decision last month to stop recycling. Even if the city agreed to pay the additional $25,000 a month that its recycling company was charging, there was no assurance that all the plastic containers and junk mail would be turned into something new, Mayor Heidi Herzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We all did recycling because it was easy, but the reality is that not much was actually being recycled,” Ms. Herzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The troubles with recycling have amplified calls for limiting waste at its source. Measures like banning plastic bags and straws, long pushed by environmental groups, are gaining traction more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div data-testid=&quot;photoviewer-children&quot; class=&quot;css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;The waste-to-energy facility in Davie, Fla. Like Sunrise, Philadelphia is using an incinerator, but for the recycling from only about half its residents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scott McIntyre for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;This month, a lobbying group for Connecticut municipalities, citing the chaos in local recycling programs, urged the governor to focus on restricting plastic bags, straws and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The sooner we accept the economic impracticality of recycling, the sooner we can make serious progress on addressing the plastic pollution problem,” said Jan Dell, an engineer who leads Last Beach Cleanup. It’s an advocacy group that works with investors and nonprofits to reduce plastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some large waste producers are still going through the motions of recycling, no matter how futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Across Memphis, large commercial enterprises have had to stop recycling for now because of contamination problems. But the airport is keeping its recycling bins in place to preserve “the culture” of recycling among passengers and employees, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We want to ensure that we are able to have a seamless transition if and when single-stream recycling returns to the Memphis area,” the spokesman, Glen Thomas, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Apple Watch detects irregular heart beat in large U.S. study</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-apple/apple-watch-detects-irregular-heart-beat-in-large-u-s-study-idUSKCN1QX0EI</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-apple/apple-watch-detects-irregular-heart-beat-in-large-u-s-study-idUSKCN1QX0EI</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The Apple Watch was able to detect irregular heart pulse rates that could signal the need for further monitoring for a serious heart rhythm problem, according to data from a large study funded by Apple Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;”symbol_AAPL.O_0”&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AAPL.O&quot;&gt;AAPL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), demonstrating a potential future role for wearable consumer technology in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope the technology can assist in early detection of atrial fibrillation, the most common form of irregular heart beat. Patients with untreated AF are five times more likely to have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results of the largest AF screening and detection study, involving over 400,000 Apple Watch users who were invited to participate, were presented on Saturday at the American College of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 400,000 participants, 0.5 percent, or about 2,000 subjects, received notifications of an irregular pulse. Those people were sent an ECG (electrocardiography) patch to wear for subsequent detection of atrial fibrillation episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third of those whose watches detected an irregular pulse were confirmed to have atrial fibrillation using the ECG technology, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 84 percent of the irregular pulse notifications were later confirmed to have been AF episodes, data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The physician can use the information from the study, combine it with their assessment ... and then guide clinical decisions around what to do with an alert,” said Dr. Marco Perez, one of the study’s lead investigators from Stanford School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that 57 percent of participants who received an alert on their watch sought medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Apple, the data provides firepower as it pushes into healthcare. Its new Series 4 Watch, which became available only after the study began so was not used, has the ability to take an electrocardiogram to detect heart problems and required clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who was not involved in the trial, called it an important study as use of this type of wearable technology is only going to become more prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study is an important first step in figuring out how can we use these technologies in a way that’s evidence based,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers urged caution by doctors in using data from consumer devices when treating patients. But they also see great future potential for this type of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Atrial fibrillation is just the beginning, as this study opens the door to further research into wearable technologies and how they might be used to prevent disease before it strikes,” said Lloyd Minor, dean of Stanford School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The difference between ‘broke’ and ‘poor’</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/12/poor-broke-difference-poverty-inequality-society</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/12/poor-broke-difference-poverty-inequality-society</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; used to have money. Not a lot, but enough. I went straight from school into a full-time profession and did everything I was supposed to: I set up an emergency fund (six months of income put aside for a rainy day); I didn’t use a credit card; I paid into my company pension. I was able to donate monthly to charity and even had enough left over for a budget-friendly vacation at the end of the year. I had a lot to be thankful for, and that feeling of good fortune only grew when I became a mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, things started to go wrong. My youngest child was diagnosed with a developmental disability and was hospitalized. For me to continue working, he’d need special one-on-one childcare. (I was quoted a rate of $41 an hour – more than I earned in my own job.) Thankfully, my employers allowed me flexible office time, so I could work from home part of the day and take my child to appointments and therapies, all of which cost money – money that was slowly slipping through my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut everything I could think of. I made everything from scratch, sold all we didn’t need, learned how to grow vegetables at a community garden in Toronto and preserved the food I grew for the winter months. We shopped secondhand. We cancelled cable. I sold my laptop and lived without a cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I got sick and had to have surgery. Even after I used up my 15 weeks of employment insurance, I still couldn’t return to work, as I was busy relearning how to walk. When I was wheeled out of the operating room after a second surgery, my first thought was: how will I afford food this week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;ILLUSTRATIONS BY FRANZISKA BARCZYK&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e96280e726c119e20732ca1ccf3abdb1a174a6/0_0_675_675/master/675.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=a6642c7e6e2be51cad77973ed801895d&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cwp-csp.ca/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Canada Without Poverty&lt;/a&gt;, a not-for-profit anti-poverty organization, &lt;a href=&quot;https://locallove.ca/issues/heres-just-how-much-poverty-can-hold-kids-back/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;1.3 million children in Canada live in poverty&lt;/a&gt;. (That’s a staggering one in five kids.) We live in one of the richest, most developed countries in the world, yet 4 million Canadians face &lt;a href=&quot;https://locallove.ca/changemakers/fighting-food-waste-and-food-insecurity-together/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;food insecurity&lt;/a&gt;. People like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, I found myself sleeping on the couch so I could rent my bedroom to international students. I folded laundry to make a little cash for groceries, since I could do that sitting down. Yet I still couldn’t pay my bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in my life before or since has humbled me quite like lining up for powdered milk, bread past its sell-by date and a small box of canned provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons your income can disappear overnight. You might get sick, as I did; your factory might close; your employer might implement mass layoffs. We live in a society where precarious seasonal and contract work without benefit plans is the norm, and genuine poverty is something that can happen to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a big difference between being “broke” and being “poor”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Poverty&lt;/a&gt; is the daily agony of not having enough money for groceries, or having to decide between buying food for your children and paying the rent. Real poverty is isolating. It’s living in fear of who will find out and how you will be judged. It’s worrying about whether social workers will take your kids, as I did for several weeks when things were at their worst. (There was a point in my shame about our poverty that even made me wonder if my children would be better off in a different family – thoughts that still haunt me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often hear my friends say, “I’m too poor” when they’re frustrated about what they can’t have. Maybe it’s a trip they can’t afford, a renovation they want to start right now or a pretty pair of shoes they spotted in a shop window. I know they don’t mean to be hurtful. But when they talk about being “poor”, they’re not actually wondering where their next meal will come from, nor are they worried about the risk of homelessness, or about not being able to afford their child’s prescription medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that instead of comparing ourselves to the Joneses like we used to, we now compare ourselves to those picture-perfect celebs and families we see on Instagram. We forget that if you have a roof over your head, clothes on your back, food in the fridge, the bills covered and a little extra in the bank – just in case – you’re better off than most of the world. And here’s where the words we use matter. If we self-identify as poor when we’re not, we risk losing the motivation to make a difference in the lives of those who really know what standing head down in line at a food bank feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Franziska Barczyk .&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9076f1d373718279aead6bc1679042ab8dd37979/0_0_675_675/master/675.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=62ff8850f594d4d895ef0854ccfcbafe&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope my children never flippantly use the phrase “I’m so poor”, just as I hope they will never experience true poverty again. There were days when I thought poverty would break us. It didn’t. But it did fundamentally change us. I hope it taught us to examine privilege and not to normalize excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write today, our life is more stable financially. I’ve found a way to share our small home with two international students, doubling our income. I’m now active in a swap group because it’s cheaper than buying things secondhand. I barter for what I can’t afford; music lessons, for instance, are “paid” for by clearing up the busy music studio. I also teach a couple of children in my neighbourhood after school and provide childcare when medical appointments allow. &lt;a href=&quot;https://notesfromthefrugaltrenches.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;I’ve become adept at counting (and re-counting) every cent&lt;/a&gt;, living off $20 a person a week for food, and finding as many free opportunities in my community as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not exactly wealthy, but we have a rich life that includes trips to the library and free rec swimming. We take advantage of free museum passes from the library. Sometimes I splurge and make homemade hot cocoa. When I reflect on our life now, I can see we are often broke, but not poor. And despite the fact that needing a new medication still forces me to cut corners, every week &lt;a href=&quot;https://locallove.ca/life/what-food-banks-really-need-and-what-they-dont/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;we give to the food bank&lt;/a&gt; – the nourishing foods that we needed at our lowest point and always hoped would be there. I’ve also joined an anti-poverty group to remind government representatives that poverty and equity matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need privileged people to stop talking about being “poor” and to instead use their voices to speak up alongside those Canadians living in actual poverty. We need to question the stereotypes and judgments that allow Ontario-wide pharmacology and dental programs to remain low priorities. And we need to make noise around the dearth of affordable housing solutions in Toronto and the GTA. Let’s keep this conversation going until there are proper safety nets in place for when bad things happen and more people are pushed from broke to poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Second prototype of the solar powered server that runs this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last updated: March 12, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-tech Magazine questions the belief in technological progress, and highlights the potential of past knowledge and technologies for designing a sustainable society. Because a web redesign was long overdue — and because we try to practice what we preach — we decided to build a low-tech website that meets our needs and abides by our principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce energy use, we opted for a back to basics web design, using a static site instead of a database driven content management system. We further apply default typefaces, dithered images, off-line reading options, and other tricks to lower energy use far below that of the average website. In addition, the low resource requirements and open design help to keep the blog accessible for visitors with older computers and/or less reliable Internet connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it uses so little energy, this website can be run on a mini-computer with the processing power of a mobile phone. It needs 1 to 2.5 watts of power, which is supplied by a small, off-grid solar &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; system on the balcony of the author’s home. Typical for off-the-grid renewable power systems, energy storage is limited. This means that the website will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#why_website&quot;&gt;Why a low-tech website?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#offline&quot;&gt;Why does it go off-line?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#often&quot;&gt;How often will it be off-line?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#old_website&quot;&gt;What happens to the old website?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#who&quot;&gt;Who made this?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#help&quot;&gt;Can I help?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#comments&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;why_website&quot;&gt;Why a Low-tech Website ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told that the Internet would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2012/energy-environment-technology-industries-smarter-2020-role-ict-driving-sustainable-future.aspx&quot;&gt;“dematerialise” society and decrease energy use&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to this projection, it has become a large and rapidly growing consumer of energy itself. According to the latest estimates, the entire network already consumes &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/can-the-internet-run-on-renewable-energy/&quot;&gt;10% of global electricity production&lt;/a&gt;, with data traffic doubling roughly every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to offset the negative consequences associated with high energy consumption, renewable energy has been proposed as a means to lower emissions from powering data centers. For example, Greenpeace’s yearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/&quot;&gt;ClickClean report&lt;/a&gt; ranks major Internet companies based on their use of renewable power sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, running data centers on renewable power sources is not enough to address the growing energy use of the Internet. To start with, the Internet already uses three times more energy than all wind and solar power sources worldwide can provide. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/04/how-sustainable-is-pv-solar-power/&quot;&gt;manufacturing, and regularly replacing, renewable power plants also requires energy&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that if data traffic keeps growing, so will the use of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, solar and wind power are not always available, which means that an Internet running on renewable power sources would require infrastructure for energy storage and/or transmission that is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/09/how-to-run-modern-society-on-solar-and-wind-powe/&quot;&gt;dependent on fossil fuels for its manufacture and replacement&lt;/a&gt;. Powering websites with renewable energy is not a bad idea. However, the trend towards growing energy use must also be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Websites are getting “fatter”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing energy use of the Internet is associated with two trends. First, content is becoming increasingly resource-intensive. This has a lot to do with the growing importance of video, but a similar trend can be observed among websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight&quot;&gt;size of the average web page&lt;/a&gt; (defined as the average page size of the 500,000 most popular websites) increased from 0.45 megabytes in 2010 to 1.7 megabytes in June 2018. For mobile websites, the average “page weight” rose tenfold from 0.15 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; in 2011 to 1.6 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; in 2018. Using different measurement methods, other sources report average page sizes of up to 2.9 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the average web page increased at least threefold from 2010 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth in data traffic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224224694/download&quot;&gt;surpasses the advances in energy efficiency&lt;/a&gt; (the energy required to transfer 1 megabyte of data over the Internet), resulting in more and more energy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over and above this, “heavier” or “larger” websites not only increase energy use in the network infrastructure, but they also shorten the lifetime of computers — larger websites require more powerful computers to access them. This means that more computers need to be manufactured, which is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology/&quot;&gt;very energy-intensive process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Always online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second reason for growing Internet energy consumption is that we spend more and more time on-line. Before the arrival of portable computing devices and wireless network access, we were only connected to the network when we had access to a desktop computer in the office, at home, or in the library. We now live in a world in which no matter where we are, we are always on-line, including, at times, via more than one device simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous network access doesn’t combine well with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which are not always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always-on” Internet access is accompanied by a cloud computing model – allowing more energy efficient user devices at the expense of increased energy use in data centers. Increasingly, activities that could perfectly happen off-line – such as writing a document, filling in a spreadsheet, or storing data – are now requiring continuous network access. This does not combine well with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which are not always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Addressing both issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new web design addresses both these issues. Thanks to a low-tech web design, we managed to decrease the average page size of the blog by a factor of five compared to the old design – all while making the website visually more attractive. Secondly, our new website runs 100% on solar power, not just in words, but in reality: it has its own energy storage and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The 50W panel, on top of it is a 10W panel of a previously built off-grid lighting system.&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/solar-panel-solar-powered-server-2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The 50W solar &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How is the website designed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is not an autonomous being. Its growing energy use is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/&quot;&gt;consequence of actual decisions&lt;/a&gt; made by software developers, web designers, marketing departments, publishers and internet users. With a lightweight, off-grid solar-powered website, we want to show that other decisions can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average page size of this website is 0.77 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; — roughly a fifth of the average page size of the original website&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 36 of about 100 articles now online, the average page weight on the solar powered website is 0.77 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; — roughly a fifth of the average page size of the previous design, and less than half the average page size of the 500,000 most popular blogs in June 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the design decisions we made to reduce energy use. We have published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar/wiki/Solar-Web-Design&quot;&gt;separate document that focuses on the front-end efforts&lt;/a&gt;, and one &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#software&quot;&gt;that focuses on the back-end&lt;/a&gt;. We have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar&quot;&gt;released the source code for our website design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Static Site Generator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental choices we made was to build a static website. Most of today’s websites use server side programming languages that generate the website on the fly by querying a database. This means that every time someone visits a web page, it is generated on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a static website is &lt;a href=&quot;https://varia.zone/en/what-a-website-can-be.html&quot;&gt;generated once and exists as a simple set of documents on the server’s hard disc&lt;/a&gt;. It’s always there — not just when someone visits the page. Static websites are thus based on file storage whereas dynamic websites depend on recurrent computation. Static websites consequently require less processing power and thus less energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A static website requires less processing power because it is not dependent on recurrent computation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice for a static site enables the possibility of serving the site in an economic manner from our home office in Barcelona. Doing the same with a database-driven website would be nearly impossible, because it would require too much energy. It would also be a big security risk. Although a web server with a static site can be hacked, there are significantly less attack routes and the damage is more easily repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dithered Images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge was to reduce page size without making the website less attractive. Because images take up most of the bandwidth, it would be easy to obtain very small page sizes and lower energy use by eliminating images, reducing their number, or making them much smaller. However, visuals are an important part of Low-tech Magazine’s appeal, and the website would not be the same without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By dithering, we can make images ten times less resource-intensive, even though they are displayed much larger than on the old website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we chose to apply an obsolete image compression technique called “dithering”. The number of colours in an image, combined with its file format and resolution, contributes to the size of an image. Thus, instead of using full-colour high-resolution images, we chose to convert all images to black and white, with four levels of grey in-between. These black-and-white images are then coloured according to the pertaining content category via the browser’s native image manipulation capacities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/new-solar-charge-controller.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Image: The server and the solar charge controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compressed through this dithering plugin, images featured in the articles add much less load to the content: compared to the old website, the images are roughly ten times less resource-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Default typeface / No logo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All resources loaded, including typefaces and logos, are an additional request to the server, requiring storage space and energy use. Therefore, our new website does not load a custom typeface and removes the font-family declaration, meaning that visitors will see the default typeface of their browser. Only one weight (regular) of a font is used, demonstrating that content hierarchy can be communicated without loading multiple typefaces and weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors will see the default typeface of their browser, eliminating the need to load a custom typeface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a similar approach for the logo. In fact, Low-tech Magazine never had a real logo, just a banner image of a spear held as a low-tech weapon against prevailing high-tech claims. Instead of a designed logotype, which would require the production and distribution of custom typefaces and imagery, Low-tech Magazine’s new identity consists of a single typographic move: to use the left-facing arrow in place of the hypen in the blog’s name: &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LOW&lt;/span&gt;←&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TECH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MAGAZINE&lt;/span&gt;. This pared-down identity drew inspiration from the past as well as the banner image of the previous design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;offline&quot;&gt;Why does it go offline?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few web hosting companies claim that their servers are running on renewable energy. However, even when they actually generate solar power on-site, and do not merely “offset” fossil fuel power use by planting trees or the like, their websites are always online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that either they have a giant battery storage system on-site (which makes their power system unsustainable), or that they are relying on grid power when there is a shortage of solar power (which means that they do not really run on 100% solar power).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the server on-line no matter what simply requires too many batteries, which makes the system unsustainable and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, this website runs on an off-the-grid solar power system with its own energy storage, and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather. Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar system, because above a certain threshold the fossil fuel energy used for producing and replacing the batteries is higher than the fossil fuel energy saved by the solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from sustainability (and costs), the author’s home has limited space for installing solar panels and batteries. Keeping the server on-line no matter what — the standard business model of webhosting companies — simply requires too many batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The 35Wh lead-acid battery and 30Wh Li-Po batteries that power the server.&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/sps_bats.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Energy storage: the lead-acid battery (12V 7Ah) on the left, and the Li-Po &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; battery (3,7V 6600mA) on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;often&quot;&gt;How often will it be offline?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web server uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/power.html&quot;&gt;between 1 and 2 watts of power&lt;/a&gt; (depending on the number of visitors), meaning that it requires between 24 Wh and 48 Wh of electricity per day. The web server is now powered by a 50 Wp solar panel and a 24 Wh Li-Po battery (3.7 V, 6.6 A). That’s enough energy storage to run the site for 12 to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the solar panel is shaded during the morning, it receives direct sunlight for only 4 to 8 hours per day, meaning that the “night” is in fact 16 to 20 hours long. Consequently, with our current energy storage, we will make it through the night as long as the night is not too long, and as long as we don’t get a spike in traffic. We don’t have enough energy storage to bridge a dark rainy day, but thanks to our relatively large solar panel (50 Wp) one to two hours of sun are enough to charge the battery completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two 7A lead-acid batteries will keep the website online during one or two days of bad weather, after which it will go off-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since October 28, we have added approximately half of the lead-acid battery capacity (cut-off voltage is 12.4). This remains a provisional set-up, until we figure out how to measure and display the lead-acid battery capacity on the website. The battery meter on the website now displays the state of the Li-Po battery. Eventually, the server will be run on the lead-acid battery alone, using a much smaller Li-Po battery to shut down the server in case of a power shortage. This set-up would keep the website online during one or two days of bad weather, after which it will go off-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;visit&quot;&gt;When is the best time to visit?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accessibility of this website depends on the weather in Barcelona, Spain, where the solar-powered web server is located. To help visitors “plan” their visits to Low-tech Magazine, we provide them with several clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A battery meter provides crucial information because it may tell the visitor that the blog is about to go down — or that it’s “safe” to read it. The design features a background colour that indicates the capacity of the solar-charged battery that powers the website server. A decreasing height indicates that night has fallen or that the weather is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help visitors “plan” their visits to Low-tech Magazine, we provide them with several clues such as a battery meter and a weather forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the battery level, other information about the website server is visible with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/weather&quot;&gt;statistics dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. This includes contextual information of the server’s location: time, current sky conditions, upcoming forecast, and the duration since the server last shut down due to insufficient power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;hardware&quot;&gt;Which hardware and software do you use?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrote two extra articles with more in-depth technical information: &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html&quot;&gt;How to build a low-tech website: software and hardware&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on the back-end, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar/wiki/Solar-Web-Design&quot;&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Website: Design Techniques and Process&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SERVER&lt;/span&gt;: This website runs on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#server&quot;&gt;Olimex A20 computer&lt;/a&gt;. It has 2 Ghz of processing power, 1 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and 16 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; of storage. The server draws 1 - 2.5 watts of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SERVER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOFTWARE&lt;/span&gt;: The webserver runs Armbian Stretch, a Debian based operating system built around the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SUNXI&lt;/span&gt; kernel. We wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#configuring-the-webserver&quot;&gt;technical documentation for configuring the webserver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DESIGN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOFTWARE&lt;/span&gt;: The website is built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.getpelican.com/&quot;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator. We have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar&quot;&gt;released the source code for ‘solar’, the Pelican theme we developed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INTERNET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CONNECTION&lt;/span&gt;. The server is connected to a 100 MBps fibre internet connection. &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#network&quot;&gt;Here’s how we configured the router&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the router is powered by grid electricity and requires 10 watts of power. We are investigating how to replace the energy-hungry router with a more efficient one that can be solar-powered, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOLAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/span&gt;. The server runs on a 50 Wp solar panel and a 24 Wh LiPo battery. However, are still experimenting with different setups (see above). The &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; installation is managed by a 10A solar charge controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;old_website&quot;&gt;What happens to the old website?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar powered Low-tech Magazine is a work in progress. For now, the grid-powered Low-tech Magazine remains on-line. Readers will be encouraged to visit the solar powered website if it is available. What happens later, is not yet clear. There are several possibilities, but much will depend on the experience with the solar powered server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we decide how to integrate the old and the new website, making and reading comments will only be possible on the grid-powered Low-tech Magazine, which is hosted at TypePad. If you want to send a comment related to the solar powered web server itself, you can do so by sending an e-mail to solar (at) lowtechmagazine (dot) com. Your comment will be published at the bottom of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;who&quot;&gt;Who made this website?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar powered server is a project by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisdedecker.org&quot;&gt;Kris De Decker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roelof.info&quot;&gt;Roel Roscam Abbing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://motsuka.com&quot;&gt;Marie Otsuka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://squishysystems.com/&quot;&gt;Lauren Traugott-Campbell&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we’re looking for ideas and feedback to further improve the website and reduce its energy use. We will document the project extensively so that others can build low-tech websites too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#room-for-improvements&quot;&gt;Here are some specific technical questions that we have&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we’re hoping for people to support this project with a financial contribution. Advertising services, which have maintained Low-tech Magazine since its start in 2007, are not compatible with our lightweight web design. Therefore, we are searching for other ways to finance the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will soon offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/offline/&quot;&gt;print-on-demand copies of the website&lt;/a&gt;. These publications will allow you to read Low-tech Magazine on paper, on the beach, in the sun, or whenever and where ever you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can support us through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.me/lowtechmagazine&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/lowtechmagazine&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://liberapay.com/lowtechmagazine/&quot;&gt;LiberaPay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
It’s been a little over a year since Facebook announced major algorithm changes that would &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/01/facebook-drastically-changes-news-feed-to-make-it-good-for-people-and-bad-for-most-publishers/&quot;&gt;decrease the amount of news in News Feed&lt;/a&gt;, instead prioritizing non-publisher content that spurs engagement and provokes comments. Fourteen or so months in, what does the news environment on Facebook look like?
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.newswhip.com/2019_03-FacebookPublishing_LP.html&quot;&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from social media tracking company NewsWhip shows that the turn toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571?pnref=story&quot;&gt;“meaningful interactions”&lt;/a&gt; has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pushed up articles on divisive topics like abortion, religion, and guns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;politics rules; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the “angry” reaction (😡) dominates many pages, with “Fox News driving the most angry reactions of anyone, with nearly double that of anyone else.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all that isn’t only Facebook’s fault. The content that dominates the platform now might have risen even without an algorithmic boost. But what’s clear is that Mark Zuckerberg’s January 2018 exhortation that the time spent on Facebook be “time well spent” has not come to pass: Instead, it’s often an angry, reactive place where people go to get worked up and to get scared. Here are the two most-shared Facebook stories of 2019 so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.01.15-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1348&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Engagement is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; higher than it was in 2018.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement — likes, comments, shares, reactions — has risen. For the first few months of this year, it was 50 percent higher than it was in 2018, and about 10 percent higher than it was in 2017 (which, remember, included Trump’s inauguration, large-scale protests, and the chaotic early days of his presidency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.07.43-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1368&quot; height=&quot;1040&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a possibility that Facebook’s friends and family focus, getting people to read what their networks are sharing rather than what pages are promoting, may have contributed to this increase as people shared articles they enjoyed on the network,” NewsWhip says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;FoxNews.com is at the top for all engagement.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FoxNews.com is far and away the top English-language publisher by engagement in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.11.20-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1366&quot; height=&quot;856&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look individually at comments or shares, however, the picture is different. The U.K. viral publisher LADbible has the highest proportion of its engagement happening via comments of the 1,000 publishers NewsWhip looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.13.36-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1366&quot; height=&quot;782&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Reuters stories get engagement mostly via shares, not comments, likes, or reactions. Some content from Canadian and local news publishers is also being shared similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.15.22-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1366&quot; height=&quot;816&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;What gets comments and shares: abortion, missing kids, Momo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most-commented and most-shared news stories were often scary or divisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.19.16-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1358&quot; height=&quot;1422&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2019/feb/01/viral-image/no-new-york-abortion-law-doesnt-let-mothers-abort-/&quot;&gt;PolitiFact rates&lt;/a&gt; the “New York abortion up to birth” story — which includes 4 of the 15 stories on the list in one form or another — as False. Henry Winkler &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/henry-winkler-death/&quot;&gt;is in fact not dead&lt;/a&gt;, not 77, and not a “Huge Trump Supporter”; Conservative Tears is a fake news site. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/2019/02/how-local-tv-news-stations-are-playing-a-major-and-enthusiastic-role-in-spreading-the-momo-hoax/&quot;&gt;we’ve covered Momo&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.19.03-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1392&quot; height=&quot;1360&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says something about 2019 that the most-shared story of the year so far on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of Facebook — getting nearly twice the shares of No. 2! — is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://us105fm.com/texas-rangers-believe-human-trafficking-suspect-child-predator-may-be-in-our-area/&quot;&gt;121-word story&lt;/a&gt; that says &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; sex offender &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be in the Waco, Texas area. (If he is, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Issac-John+Bernard+Collins&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=sbd:1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj24_7iooThAhUJnFkKHWuQCVgQpwUIIQ&amp;amp;biw=1439&amp;amp;bih=789&amp;amp;dpr=2&quot;&gt;doesn’t appear they’ve found him&lt;/a&gt;.) No doubt writing the headline as “In Our Area” instead of “In the Waco Area” led to lots of shares from people who thought it was a local-to-them story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Politics = anger.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Angry” is the top reaction when it comes to politics content, though not other types of content (“the one exception to this political rule was when animals were involved, particularly animals rescued from owners that mistreated them”). Fox News had the most “angries,” but left-leaning pages and properties clearly aren’t exempt; Daily Kos also drives a large percentage of angry reactions, as do The Washington Post and Axios. (And, by the way, Bernie Sanders is “the politician [who] drives the most angries.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.24.13-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1516&quot; height=&quot;984&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meaww.com&quot;&gt;MEEAW&lt;/a&gt; is a Bangalore-based viral site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.niemanlab.org/images/Screen-Shot-2019-03-15-at-8.24.03-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1442&quot; height=&quot;958&quot; class=&quot;nakedboxedimagewide&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10104525464389883&amp;amp;set=a.692319249513&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;farewell note&lt;/a&gt; after his departure from Facebook was announced yesterday, chief product officer Chris Cox said that “social media’s history is not yet written, and its effects are not neutral.” These lists would seem to back the idea Facebook’s effects are indeed not neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full report is available for download &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.newswhip.com/2019_03-FacebookPublishing_LP.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul readability=&quot;20.390862944162&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/31/17412396/telegram-apple-app-store-app-updates-russia&quot;&gt;has blocked Telegram from upgrading its app&lt;/a&gt; for a month. This evidently has to do with Russia's command to Apple to block Telegram in Russia.
&lt;p&gt;The Telegram client is free software on other platforms, but no apps are free on an iThing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.024154589372&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple used its censorship system to enforce China's censorship by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/05/apple-removes-new-york-times-app-in-china&quot;&gt;blocking distribution of the New York Times app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More about Apple's &lt;a href=&quot;http://gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html&quot;&gt;censorship of apps and other malicious functionalities&lt;/a&gt; in Apple software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.73648648648649&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple appears to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/10/apple-blocks-bitcoin-payments-on-secure-messaging-app-gliph&quot;&gt;censoring all bitcoin apps for iThings.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be illegal to make or distribute computers which are platforms for censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.9651162790698&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple demonstrates the arbitrariness of its censorship by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/30/apple-blocks-us-drone-strike-app&quot;&gt;blocking an app that tells people with text messages when US drone attacks kill civilians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author said that this app was meant to raise awareness. I hope Apple's censorship of it raises awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple censors &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org/archives/2011-nov-feb.html#4_December_2011_%28Apple%29&quot;&gt;information about abortion providers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.69230769230769&quot;&gt;As of 2015, Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/23/apple-anti-choice-tendencies-showing-in-app-store-reproductive-rights&quot;&gt;systematically bans apps&lt;/a&gt; that endorse abortion rights or would help women find abortions.
&lt;p&gt;This particular political slant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/siri-abortion-apple-unintenional-omissions&quot;&gt;affects other Apple services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple's mail service &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org/archives/2011-jul-oct.html#11_July_2011_%28Apple_Mail_Censored%29&quot;&gt;silently censors the mail&lt;/a&gt; people send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org/archives/2010-nov-feb.html#23%20December%202010%20%28Apple%20pulls%20Wikileaks%20app%20from%20store%29&quot;&gt;deauthorized a Wikileaks access application&lt;/a&gt;, using censorship to support censorship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;13.004566210046&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.techeye.net/internet/apple-begins-censoring-books&quot;&gt;censors iTunes ebooks&lt;/a&gt; — banning all mention of Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should not do business with Amazon, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org/amazon.html&quot;&gt;mistreats authors, publishers, its workers, and its customers&lt;/a&gt;. Ms Lisle's presupposition that the goal of success is all that matters is not admirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn't justify Apple's censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, publishing in iTunes was already bad for other reasons, such as DRM, and requiring users to use nonfree software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/nov/16/erotic-novel-removed-itunes-cover&quot;&gt;banned from iTunes&lt;/a&gt; the erotic novel, The Proof of the Honey, saying it was because of the cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.93010752688172&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple censored a game for the iThings called &lt;a href=&quot;http://storify.com/fredericjacobs/the-hypocrisy-of-the-west&quot;&gt;Angry Syrians&lt;/a&gt;, which is a political parody of Angry Birds.&lt;/p&gt;
Apple said it was &quot;defamatory or offensive&quot; — to the dictator Assad, apparently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.7292576419214&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/03/16/apples-shut-down-iranians-disturbing-trend-us-government-must-reverse&quot;&gt;cut off access to the app store&lt;/a&gt; for Iranian users of iMonsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying wrong here is that Apple gave itself censorship power over everyone that uses those computers — power that we should not allow anyone to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.7180385288967&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs used Apple's censorship power to impose prudery on the net, and this is part of why Stumblr is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/11/tumblr-porn-ban-heteronormative-silicon-valley-sex-lives&quot;&gt;now deleting everything&lt;/a&gt; that won't be rated G.
&lt;p&gt;I tried to view a Tumblr page, but its contents did not appear. It seemed to be totally dependent on nonfee Javascript code. Whatever may disappear from Tumblr, I personally will not miss it. Nonetheless, I am concerned about this issue because creeping prudish censorship is dangerous in general; we should fight it in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us therefore invite Apple to go fuck itself and post a selfie of that act on Stumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;spying&quot;&gt;Spying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple spies on its users, and helps others spy on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the lever of &quot;You have a choice, but unless you say yes, your old activities will stop working&quot; is something that Apple has done before, with malicious &quot;upgrades&quot;. Apple ostensibly doesn't force people to accept the new nasty thing; it just punishes them if they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

During that time, governments used that security hole to invade people's computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple pioneered techniques for avoiding the US corporate tax (even though it is far too low) in order &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html?_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=1&amp;amp;hp&quot;&gt;to pay next to no tax.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loopholes that Apple uses would be closed, if not for the political power of business. &quot;Free trade&quot; treaties give business increased power to block such changes, so we must abolish them to break business's power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/22/young-appmakers-cant-job-life&quot;&gt;exploits the app developers mercilessly,&lt;/a&gt; aside from a few stars whose role is to give a misleading impression of what developers can expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't sympathize much with those app developers, since they are making proprietary software. They all deserve to fail. However, that doesn't excuse the way Apple treats them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.1105882352941&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple lures people into the business of developing apps with visions of the great wealth that a few of them get. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html?pagewanted=4&amp;amp;hp&quot;&gt;Most just fail, often losing a substantial investment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who intentionally develops proprietary software (i.e., does not respect users' freedom) deserves no sympathy, but that doesn't excuse Apple for luring people into it. Some of them would not have tried to develop proprietary software if not for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple is a major patent aggressor. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/apple-now-owns-the-page-turn/?smid=tw-nytimesbits&amp;amp;seid=auto&quot;&gt;rather absurd patent&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will surely use against other mobile computers.

&lt;p&gt;Lots of iThing users complained that they did not want the U2 album &quot;gift&quot; that Apple stuck them with — and that it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnet.com/news/apples-free-u2-album-perplexes-and-annoys-some-users/&quot;&gt;hard to delete&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complaints focus on a superficial problem, reflecting the shallow thinking that Apple instills in its users. Ironically, though, this superficial problem reflects a much deeper problem that the complainers have failed to notice: the unjust power that Apple has imposed on whoever uses an iThing or iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Apple has joined EPEAT again, it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/16/apple-rejoins-epeat&quot;&gt;does not cover the iThings&lt;/a&gt; — only the Macintosh.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google’s Nest fiasco harms user trust and invades their privacy</title>
<link>https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/2019/03/googles-nest-fiasco-harms-user-trust-and-invades-their-privacy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/2019/03/googles-nest-fiasco-harms-user-trust-and-invades-their-privacy/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Technology companies, lawmakers, privacy advocates, and everyday consumers likely disagree about exactly how a company should go about collecting user data. But, following a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/nest-microphone-was-never-supposed-to-be-a-secret-2019-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;trust-shattering move by Google last month&lt;/a&gt; regarding its Nest Secure product, consensus on one issue has emerged: Companies shouldn’t ship products that can surreptitiously spy on users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing to disclose that a product can collect information from users in ways they couldn’t have reasonably expected is bad form. It invades privacy, breaks trust, and robs consumers of the ability to make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While collecting data on users is nearly inevitable in today’s corporate world, secret, undisclosed, or unpredictable data collection—or data collection abilities—is another problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smart-home speaker shouldn’t be secretly hiding a video camera. A secure messaging platform shouldn’t have a government-operated backdoor. And a home security hub that controls an alarm, keypad, and motion detector shouldn’t include a clandestine microphone feature—especially one that was never announced to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, that is precisely what Google’s home security product includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google fumbles once again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google announced that its Nest Secure would be updated to work with Google Assistant software. Following the update, users could simply utter “Hey Google” to access voice controls on the product line-up’s “Nest Guard” device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem, though, is that Google never told users that its product had an internal microphone to begin with. Nowhere inside the Nest Guard’s hardware specs, or in its marketing materials, could users find evidence of an installed microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Business Insider broke the news, Google fumbled ownership of the problem: “The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs,” a Google spokesperson said. “That was an error on our part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers, academics, and privacy advocates balked at this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is deliberately misleading and lying to your customers about your product,” wrote Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oops! We neglected to mention we’re recording everything you do while fronting as a security device,” wrote Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) spoke in harsher terms: Google’s disclosure failure wasn’t just bad corporate behavior, it was downright criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a federal crime to intercept private communications or to plant a listening device in a private residence,” EPIC said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://epic.org/2019/02/epic-to-ftc-after-home-spying-.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://epic.org/privacy/ftc/google/EPIC-FTC-Nest-Google.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, the organization urged the Federal Trade Commission to take “enforcement action” against Google, with the hope of eventually separating Nest from its parent. (Google purchased Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days later, the US government stepped in. The Senate Select Committee on Commerce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/senate-demands-google-ceo-answer-for-hidden-nest-microphone/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt;, demanding answers about the company’s disclosure failure. Whether Google was actually recording voice data didn’t matter, the senators said, because hackers could still have taken advantage of the microphone’s capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As consumer technology becomes ever more advanced, it is essential that consumers know the capabilities of the devices they are bringing into their homes so they can make informed choices,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://c-5uwzmx78pmca90x24eeex2ekwuumzkmx2eamvibmx2eowd.g00.cnet.com/g00/3_c-5eee.kvmb.kwu_/c-5UWZMXPMCA90x24pbbx78ax3ax2fx2feee.kwuumzkm.amvibm.owdx2fx78cjtqkx2f_kikpmx2fnqtmax2f6m7926l3-l06i-274j-71ml-l8941i8873mjx2fJ714619MKNL87078IN08NJ0822911620.eqksmz-bpcvm-uwziv-tmbbmz-bw-owwotm-80.03.97.x78ln_$/$/$/$/$/$?i10c.ua=1&amp;amp;i10c.dv=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the letter said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t just about user data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting user data is essential to today’s technology companies. It powers Yelp recommendations based on a user’s location, product recommendations based on an Amazon user’s prior purchases, and search results based on a Google user’s history. Collecting user data also helps companies find bugs, patch software, and retool their products to their users’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some of that data collection is visible to the user. And when it isn’t, it can at least be learned by savvy consumers who research privacy policies, read tech specs, and compare similar products. Other home security devices, for example, advertise the ability to trigger alarms at the sound of broken windows—a functionality that demands a working microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s failure to disclose its microphone prevented even the most privacy-conscious consumers from knowing what they were getting in the box. It is nearly the exact opposite approach that rival home speaker maker Sonos took when it installed a microphone in its own device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sonos does it better&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Sonos revealed that its newest line of products would eventually integrate with voice-controlled smart assistants. The company opted for transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonos updated its privacy policy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sonos.com/en/sonos-privacy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;published a blog about the update&lt;/a&gt;, telling users: “The most important thing for you to know is that Sonos does not keep recordings of your voice data.” Further, Sonos eventually designed its speaker so that, if an internal microphone is turned on, so is a small LED light on the device’s control panel. These two functions cannot be separated—the LED light and the internal microphone are hardwired together. If one receives power, so does the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this function has upset some Sonos users who want to turn off the microphone light, the company hasn’t budged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Sonos spokesperson said the company values its customers’ privacy because it understands that people are bringing Sonos products into their homes. Adding a voice assistant to those products, the spokesperson said, resulted in Sonos taking a transparent and plain-spoken approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare this approach to Google’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers purchased a product that they trusted—quite ironically—with the security of their homes, only to realize that, by purchasing the product itself, their personal lives could have become less secure. This isn’t just a company failing to disclose the truth about its products. It’s a company failing to respect the privacy of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microphone in a home security product may well be a useful feature that many consumers will not only endure but embrace. In fact, internal microphones are available in many competitor products today, proving their popularity. But a secret microphone installed without user knowledge instantly erodes trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we showed in our recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/2019/03/labs-survey-finds-privacy-concerns-distrust-of-social-media-rampant-with-all-age-groups/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;data privacy report&lt;/a&gt;, users care a great deal about protecting their personal information online and take many steps to secure it. To win over their trust, businesses need to responsibly disclose features included in their services and products—especially those that impact the security and privacy of their customers’ lives. Transparency is key to establishing and maintaining trust online.&lt;/p&gt;
