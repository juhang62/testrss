&lt;/header&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;hugelkultur raised garden beds in a nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;grow a typical garden without irrigation or fertilization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has been demonstrated to work in deserts as well as backyards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use up rotting wood, twigs, branches and even whole trees that would otherwise go to the dump or be burned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is pretty much nothing more than buried wood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can be flush with the ground, although raised garden beds are typically better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can start small, and be added to later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can always be small - although bigger is better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can save the world from global warming by doing carbon sequestration in your own back yard!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perfect for places that have had trees blown over by storms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can help end world hunger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give a gift to your future self&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a german word and some people can say it all german-ish. I'm an american doofus, so I say &quot;hoogle culture&quot;. I had to spend some time with google to find the right spelling. Hugal, hoogal, huegal, hugel .... And I really like saying it out loud: &quot;hugelkultur, hoogle culture, hoogal kulture ....&quot; - it could be a chant or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this high-falootin word at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums&quot;&gt;permaculture&lt;/a&gt; training. I also saw it demonstrated on the Sepp Holzer terraces and raised beds video - he didn't call it hugelkultur, but he was doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugelkultur is nothing more than making raised garden beds filled with rotten wood. This makes for raised garden beds loaded with &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/18.0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;organic&lt;/a&gt; material, nutrients, air pockets for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3498_0/permaculture/roots-tap-and-otherwise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt; of what you plant, etc. As the years pass, the deep &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/5056_0/permaculture/building-soil-faster-than-nature&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt; of your raised garden bed becomes incredibly rich and loaded with soil life. As the wood shrinks, it makes more tiny air pockets - so your hugelkultur becomes sort of self tilling. The first few years, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2592_0/organic-sustainable-practices/composting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;composting&lt;/a&gt; process will slightly warm your soil giving you a slightly &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2761_0/permaculture/season-extenders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;longer growing season&lt;/a&gt;. The woody matter helps to keep nutrient excess from passing into the ground water - and then refeeding that to your garden plants later. Plus, by holding SO much water, hugelkultur could be part of a system for &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3961_0/permaculture/urban-desert-permaculture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;growing garden crops in the desert with no irrigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think there are some considerations to keep in mind. For example, I don't think I would use &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3961_0/permaculture/urban-desert-permaculture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cedar&lt;/a&gt;. Cedar lasts so long because it is loaded with &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/6970_0/permaculture/the-myth-of-allelopathic-wood-chipswood-chips-made-from-cedars-will-kill-plants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;natural pesticides/herbicides/anti-fungal/anti-microbial&lt;/a&gt; (remember, good soil has lots of fungal and microbial stuff). Not a good mix for &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3904_0/permaculture/grow-tomatoes-without-irrigation-or-fertilizer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; or melons, eh? Black locust, black cherry, black walnut? These woods have issues. &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/224_0/woodland-care/what-makes-black-locust-last-so-long-is-it-safe-for-gardens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Black locust&lt;/a&gt; won't rot - I think because it is so dense. &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/1249_0/organic-sustainable-practices/juglone-planting-under-walnuts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Black walnut&lt;/a&gt; is very toxic to most plants, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/8771_0/organic-sustainable-practices/the-best-cherry-varieties&quot;&gt;cherry&lt;/a&gt; is toxic to animals, but it might be okay when it rots - but I wouldn't use it until I had done the research. Known excellent woods are: &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/5978_0/woodland-care/the-value-of-alder-alnus-glutinosa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;alders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/998_0/permaculture/growing-apples-from-seeds-vs-cloning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/3603_0/woodland-care/about-cottonwood-trees&quot;&gt;cottonwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/2497_0/woodland-care/poplar-good-for-what&quot;&gt;poplar&lt;/a&gt;, willow (dry) and birch. I suspect maples would be really good too, but am not certain. Super rotten wood is better than slightly aged wood. The best woods are even better when they have been cut the same day (this allows you to &quot;seed&quot; the wood with your choice of fungus - shitake mushrooms perhaps?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that wood is high in carbon and will consume nitrogen to do the compost thing. This could lock up the nitrogen and take it away from your growies. But well rotted wood doesn't do this so much. If the wood is far enough along, it may have already taken in sooooo much nitrogen, that it is now putting it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pine and fir will have some levels of tanins in them, but I'm guessing that most of that will be gone when the wood has been dead for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the drawings at right, the artist is trying to show that while the wood decomposes and shrinks, the leaves, duff and accumulating organic matter from above will take it's place. The artist is showing the new organic matter as a dark green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;post&quot; readability=&quot;49.5&quot;&gt;&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2&gt;building them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;57.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/raised-garden-beds-top.png&quot; alt=&quot;raised garden beds on top of sod&quot; title=&quot;raised garden beds on top of sod&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;raised garden beds on top of sod -&lt;br/&gt;the soil comes from somewhere else&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/raised-garden-beds-bury.png&quot; alt=&quot;raised garden beds dug in a bit&quot; title=&quot;raised garden beds dug in a bit&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;raised garden beds dug in a bit -&lt;br/&gt;note the sod is put upside down on the wood&lt;br/&gt;and the topsoil is on top of that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/raised-garden-beds-double-sod.png&quot; alt=&quot;raised garden beds plus deep paths&quot; title=&quot;raised garden beds plus deep paths&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;raised garden beds dug in a bit -&lt;br/&gt;plus paths are dug on the sides and&lt;br/&gt;that sod/soil goes on top too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find I most often build hugelkultur in places where the soil is shallow. So I end up finding excess soil from somewhere else on the property and piling it on some logs. Presto! Instant raised garden beds! This is usually the easiest/fastest way too. Especially if you have earth moving equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those times that the soil is deep and you are moving the soil by hand, I like to dig up the sod and dig down a foot or two. Then pile in the wood. Then put the sod on top of the wood, upside-down. Then pile the topsoil on top of that. Even better is to figure out where the paths will be, and dig down there too. Add two layers of sod onto the logs and then the double topsoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have discovered that a lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea of raised bed gardens. They have seen the large flat gardens for years and are sure this is the way to do it. Some people are okay with raised beds that are three to six inches tall - they consider anything taller than that unsightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is gonna sound crazy, but I hope to convince you that the crazy-sounding stuff is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build your hugelkultur raised garden beds tall enough, you won't have to irrigate. At all (after the second year). No hoses. No drip system. Anything shorter won't require as much irrigation - so there is still some benefit. Imagine going on vacation in the summer without having to hire somebody to &lt;s&gt;kill&lt;/s&gt; water your garden! As a further bonus, the flavor of everything you grow will be far better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go all summer long without a drop of rain, you need to build your hugelkultur raised bed gardens .... six feet tall. But they'll shrink! Mostly in the first month. Which is why I suggest you actually build them seven feet tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugelkultur raised garden beds can be built just two feet tall and will hold moisture for about three weeks. Not quite as good, but more within the comfort zone of many people - including urban neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will start out with hugelkultur raised garden beds that are two and a half feet tall and plant only annuals. And each year they will build the size of the bed a foot. So that after a few years, they will have the bigger beds and the neighbors never really noticed. And if they've tasted what comes from it - they might be all for it without caring about the big mounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, isn't this much better use of the wood than hauling it to the dump, or chipping it, or putting it in those big city bins for yard waste?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually build hugelkulture raised garden beds about five feet wide. This makes for some mighty steep beds. Just pack that soil on tight and plant it with a mix of heavy rooted plants to hold it all together. Quick! Before it rains! If you are going to build beds shorter than three feet tall, I suggest that you make the beds no wider than four feet wide. Unless you are doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://permies.com/permaculture-forums/6518_0/permaculture/starting-a-key-hole-garden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;keyhole style raised garden beds&lt;/a&gt;, in which case you should be able to get away with something wider.&lt;/p&gt;

In this DVD we talk about hugelkultur and terraces. This location gets frost in the winter and can be really hot in the summer. A lot of the surrounding area looks very desert like. We decide to make a hugelkultur bed shaped into a sun scoop. And the angle of the slope is optimized to the level of the sun in winter. We also talk about how swales are excellent at creating frost pockets which works to your advantage in the summer. What type of wood and different variations for hugelkultur are covered. A terrace is constructed to hold the hugelkultur bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hugelkultur raised garden beds below were built in an urban lot between the curb and the sidewalk (sometimes called a parking strip). The final raised garden bed is about two feet tall. The beds are about six feet wide with keyholes. There is rotted maple on the inside and black locust (will rot in about 70 years) on the outside:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another video I made of Mark Vander Meer talking about a three foot tall bed and how little water the riparian species need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is sod that was piled in the spring and had some tomato plants stuck in it. It was not irrigated all summer. The tomatoes not only survived, but they are delicious. Winter frost should hit any day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;post&quot; readability=&quot;74&quot;&gt;&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;FAQ&quot;&gt;hugelkultur raised beds FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My HOA won't allow anything like that, what do I do? (my neighbors would freak out, what do I do?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many possibilities. Some people dig a trench five feet deep, fill that with organic matter and have something that is either flush with the surface or it appears to be only one foot tall (which is in the comfort zone of neighbors and HOA folk). Other people will build something that is 18 inches high the first year, and add a foot each year. Still others will have so many neighbors build them all at once that it is difficult the buck the tide. And then there is always the back yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have standing trees that are about to be cut down. I don't want to have a bunch of logs sitting around until they are old to be used for raised garden beds. What do I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wood doesn't have to be old to be used. In fact, it is even better when fresh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a wood chipper/shredder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. This style of raised garden beds works much better if the wood is not chipped. So much more peaceful and less smelly too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I till it every spring?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the raised garden bed is built, you don't ever till it. As the wood breaks down inside the bed, it will sorta-kinda till its insides itself. And with a really tall, really steep raised garden bed, nobody will step on it, so the soil will not become compacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm 81 years old. Does this make gardening less work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work to set up. But less work as the years pass. Planting and harvesting should be easier since you won't have to bend down as much. On the second year and beyond, all irrigation and fertilization will be eliminated - so that's less work. When combined with permaculture and polyculture techniques, you can even eliminate planting seeds, so that in the end, all you ever do is harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will this do to the flavor of the food?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will make for stronger flavor. Especially for fruits. Expect far more flavor in tomatoes and berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;post&quot; readability=&quot;46.614604462475&quot;&gt;&lt;header&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;largescale&quot;&gt;large scale hugelkultur&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I guess a person could think of the wood used in hugelkultur as &quot;wild compost&quot;! Available in twig, stick and log sizes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I popped on out to my local hugelkultur store and I saw this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/pile.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yummy! I'm guessing that somebody did some thinning and stacked this to use for firewood in the future. Only they never came back and got it. So the years passed and the wood rotted ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took most of it and put it on my tractor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/pile_b.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/pile_tractor.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left stuff that was so rotten that it would not transport well. Besides, it's going to do some good for the forest if not for my raised beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instant raised bed! Just lay down wood, and cover with dirt! That's all there is to it! Just two easy steps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/bed_a.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/bed_b.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/bed_c.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/bed_d.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/bed_e.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/bed_f.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a hurky big bed! It will probabably be about 1/3 the size a year from now. Then we'll place rocks around it and rework it a little into a slightly more elegant raised bed. This year: potatoes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bart and I created a micro documentary for all of the supporters. It is animation rich, and a very polished, professional creation. Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to shape your landscape to be warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraging diversity inside the hugelkultur as well as outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic vs. Permaculture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the full 3-DVD set is for urban gardeners as well as people with acreage, and the full 3-DVD set will contain far more information on hugelkultur, this micro documentary will be focused on gardening and have no focus on projects with larger acreage.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Booting to &amp;#039;Hello Rust&amp;#039; on x86_64</title>
<link>https://micouy.github.io/posts/low-level-pt-1/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://micouy.github.io/posts/low-level-pt-1/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about how I booted to bare metal Rust on x86_64. My goal is to describe my learning path and hopefully get you interested in things I talk about. I’ll be very happy if you find this content useful. Note that I’m a begginer and I may be wrong about many things. If you want to learn more, I’ll put links to many resources. You can find all the code in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/micouy/gniazdo-os&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this project came from many sources. I think I first discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial&quot;&gt;cfenollosa/os-tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. I also read a few chapters from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf&quot;&gt;Writing a Simple Operating System - from Scratch&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a good introduction to OS dev and related topics. First part of the tutorial is about bootloaders. To get a grasp of what it’s all about, I just read every part of the tutorial and tried to write the Assembly code by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief explanation of the boot process and what you have to do at each stage. First the CPU thinks it’s an Intel 8086 model form 1970s IIRC. This stage is called Real Mode. You have ~1MiB of memory and 16-bit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register&quot;&gt;registers&lt;/a&gt; at your disposition. In RM you are very limited. However, at this stage you can use BIOS routines (or interrupts). They’re like an external library you can use to print a character on the screen, read from and write to hard disk etc. You can obviously do these things in other modes but you have to implement it yourself or do some hacking to use the interrupts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re done with RM, you can switch to Protected Mode. In PM the address space is extended (you can access more memory), 32-bit registers are enabled and addressing works a bit different. To switch to PM, you have to set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/view/the-world-of-protected-mode&quot;&gt;Descriptor Table&lt;/a&gt; which is a piece of data that tells the CPU how to interpret addresses, and describes the characteristics of particular parts of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: At first I thought that in PM address like &lt;code&gt;ds:ebx&lt;/code&gt; works just like in RM - &lt;code&gt;ds&lt;/code&gt; is the segment (in ‘data’ memory if you want to read/write to it or in ‘code’ memory if you jump to it) and &lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt; is the offset in this segment. In reality &lt;code&gt;ds&lt;/code&gt; acts like an index into the descriptor table. Then, the selected descriptor is used to translate the offset from the segment base (stored in &lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt;) to a physical address. You can read more about addressing in PM &lt;a href=&quot;http://ece-research.unm.edu/jimp/310/slides/micro_arch2.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also check out other stuff on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ece-research.unm.edu/jimp/&quot;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootloader is a very short piece of code - it’s just 512 bytes long. I once even ran out of space and had to remove some strings and unnecessary code. The actual purpose of the bootloader is to load and run some other code. The book suggested booting to PM and jumping to a 32-bit kernel written in C. I didn’t really like programming in C and at this point I lost my motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time I learned about Philipp Oppermann’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://os.phil-opp.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on OS dev in Rust. I highly recommend it. I got really excited but, unfortunately for me, Oppermann uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/&quot;&gt;GRUB&lt;/a&gt; (a kind of bootloader) so I decided to come back to the tutorial after finishing my own bootloader. At that time booting to a program written in language other than Assembly and compiled to a separate file was way beyond my capabilities so I left the project for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I got motivated enough to try to boot to a Rust program. My plan was to switch to Long Mode. Then I could either run a 64-bit kernel or load a second stage bootloader. Second stage bootloader is not limited to one sector (can be more than 512 bytes long) and can be 32-bit or even 64-bit so it has access to a larger address space and can load arbitrarily large files from disk to memory (as long as you implement it). Its purpose is to load larger kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was loading my program from hard disk to memory. I took a naive approach. I compiled the bootloader and my program. I concatenated both binaries together, one right after the other, to form one file, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat bootloader.bin hello_rust.bin &amp;gt; img
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t care if I could actually execute Rust code, I just wanted to test if I can load it. I added necessary code to my bootloader and ran the emulator. Unfortunately QEMU just kept restarting. I’m not sure what went wrong but it didn’t matter since it was a stupid way to do it. I could just test loading data from the disk on a much simpler bootloader. I first tried to write it myself but after a while I just grabbed some code from Stack Overflow and added a simple error message in case the BIOS routine failed. After a couple of tries I finally managed to create a two-stage bootloader in a single Assembly program. It worked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-nasm&quot; data-lang=&quot;nasm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;org&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0x7c00&lt;/span&gt;
first_stage:
    &lt;span&gt;; load second stage.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;; `dl` register specifies which disk to load&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;; data from. it is set by the CPU to the same device&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;; the bootloader was loaded from.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;; set `es` to 0x7e0 and `bx` to 0x0.&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span&gt;; the routine will load data to `(es &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 4) | bx`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;; or 0x7e00.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; ax, &lt;span&gt;0x7e0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; es, ax
    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; bx, &lt;span&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; al, &lt;span&gt;0x1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;; # of sectors to read.&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; ax &lt;span&gt;; store `al` for later.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;; specify where the data is stored on the disk.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; ch, &lt;span&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;; cylinder.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; dh, &lt;span&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;; head.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; cl, &lt;span&gt;0x2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;; sector right after bootloader.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;; `int 0x13` with `ah` set to 0x2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;; loads data from disk to memory.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; ah, &lt;span&gt;0x2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0x13&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt; bx &lt;span&gt;; restore `al` to `bl`.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;; check whether the number of sectors read is correct.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt; al, bl
    &lt;span&gt;jne&lt;/span&gt; error
       
    &lt;span&gt;jmp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0x7e00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;; jump to second stage.&lt;/span&gt;

error:
    &lt;span&gt;; print error message, then halt.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;jmp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;; fill the rest of the first sector with zeros.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;; it's 510 and not 512 because the last two bytes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;; are 0xaa and 0x55 - the 'magic' number.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;510&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;) db &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;dw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0xaa55&lt;/span&gt;

second_stage:
    &lt;span&gt;; do something, then halt.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;jmp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;; padding to fill the rest of the second sector with zeros.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;) db &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way I didn’t have to link multiple files and NASM managed the padding of sectors for me. The code correctly compiled to a single file which was exactly 1024 bytes long - two entire sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;align 512&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;times 1024-($-$$)&lt;/code&gt; to allow your code to be arbitrarily large. This could be useful if you wanted to program the second stage of your bootloader in Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t assume that the registers are initialized with any particular value. It took me half an hour or so to realize that I didn’t set some register correctly in such a simple piece of code. IIRC there are only two things you can be sure of - that the bootloader will be loaded to 0x7c00 and that the &lt;code&gt;dl&lt;/code&gt; register points to the same device the bootloader has been loaded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I managed to load the second sector I wanted to replace the Assembly code with Rust code. To check whether I could execute it I needed to switch to Long Mode. That’s because I had some problems with compiling Rust code to 32-bit and I ended up using the &lt;code&gt;x86_64-unknown-none&lt;/code&gt; target triple, just like in Oppermann’s tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Mode adds a new memory model (paging), and enables the use of 64-bit instructions and registers. Switching to LM requires setting up paging. I identity-mapped the first 2 MiB of memory which is enough for now. I think it can be modified later by my Rust program. I read the following guides on paging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other things you have to do before switching to LM like checking &lt;code&gt;cpuid&lt;/code&gt; instruction support and the highest instruction op code available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured that to execute Rust code I needed to glue it with the bootloader to create a single binary. In this step I encountered a few difficult problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To work correctly, the bootloader has to be stored in the first 512 bytes of the file. The last two bytes of this sector have to be 0xaa55.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Rust code should also be aligned with the sectors and fill up the last sector entirely. Of course I would fill it with some garbage values but they had to be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bootloader has to know how long the Rust code is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both programs will be loaded at specific locations in the memory so I have to manage the offsets in addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linker seemed like a tool made for this. I’ve never used a linker before so I just read &lt;a href=&quot;https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_node/ld_toc.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt;'s documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, I got a bit confused. I didn’t understand how the &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; operator worked in linker scripts. I also got something wrong about the &lt;code&gt;AT()&lt;/code&gt; instruction. You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/comments/hhd7uj/linking_bootloader_with_second_stage/&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; I started on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I came up with such script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SECTIONS {
    .boot 0x7c00 : {
        *(.boot.*);
    }

    .hello_rust 0x7e00 : {
        *(.rust.*);
        . = ALIGN(512);
    } = 0xdeadc0de

    SECOND_STAGE_LENGTH = ((. - ADDR(.hello_rust)) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 9);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that I put all sections beginning with &lt;code&gt;.boot&lt;/code&gt; in the first 512 bytes and all sections beginning with &lt;code&gt;.rust&lt;/code&gt; after 0x7e00. In order to make it work I have to rename all sections in the ELF file emitted by &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt; so that they all start with a prefix. I do it using &lt;code&gt;objcopy&lt;/code&gt; (in some linkers this option is called &lt;code&gt;--prefix-sections&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;objcopy hello_rust.o hello_rust_prefixed.o --prefix-alloc-sections&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'.rust'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The there are two tricks in this script. The first one is that I align the end of the &lt;code&gt;.rust&lt;/code&gt; section to the nearest sector boundary with &lt;code&gt;. = ALIGN(512)&lt;/code&gt;. Then I fill the rest with some garbage using &lt;code&gt;= 0xdeadc0de&lt;/code&gt;. The second trick is in the last line. The &lt;code&gt;SECOND_STAGE_LENGTH&lt;/code&gt; variable tells the bootloader how many sectors the second stage occupies. The size of this section is divided by 512 = 2^9. Since I know that the end of this section is aligned with the boundaries of the sectors I can just shift it 9 bits to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These solutions seem a bit hacky. In my understanding the location of a piece of code in an ELF file (most common target) doesn’t matter. This is not the case with the bootloader since the code must be aligned to 512 bytes and there must be a magic number at the end of the first sector. I’m not sure if there’s a problem with my lack of knowledge or linkers are just not suitable for such tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I still don’t understand why I can’t just ‘unpack’ whole files into sections &lt;code&gt;.boot&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.hello_rust&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SECTIONS {
    .boot 0x7c00 : {
        boot.o;
    }

    .hello_rust 0x7e00 : {
        hello_rust.o;
        . = ALIGN(512);
    } = 0xdeadc0de

    SECOND_STAGE_LENGTH = ((. - ADDR(.hello_rust)) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 9);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary produced by the linker is not even 1024 bytes long and there’s no &lt;code&gt;0xdeadc0de&lt;/code&gt; at the end. After trying to run QEMU it just keeps rebooting over and over so I suspect there are many things wrong with this program. Unfortunately, I know almost nothing about linking so I can’t tell you why it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another thing I don’t get about linking. When I inspected &lt;code&gt;hello_rust.o&lt;/code&gt; file there were many sections like &lt;code&gt;.relo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.symtab&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.strtab&lt;/code&gt;. The debug build has even more of them. I get it that they store useful information about the ELF. But in order to produce a binary I have to include each section in my script (otherwise the linker complains). Should I just write each sections’s name? Where do I get the whole list of sections from? What if they change? I suppose I could just prefix them all like I did. But what if there are many files I want to link?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part - the Rust program. So far it only prints &lt;code&gt;HR&lt;/code&gt; on screen. To set up the project and compile it properly I followed the instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://os.phil-opp.com/&quot;&gt;Oppermann’s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;main.rs&lt;/code&gt; looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-Rust&quot; data-lang=&quot;Rust&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;#![no_std]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;#![no_main]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; core::panic::PanicInfo;

&lt;span&gt;#[panic_handler]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;panic&lt;/span&gt;(_info: &lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PanicInfo&lt;/span&gt;) -&amp;gt; &lt;span&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; {}
}

&lt;span&gt;#[no_mangle]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;pub&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;C&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;_start&lt;/span&gt;() -&amp;gt; &lt;span&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span&gt;// print &quot;HR&quot; in the top left corner
&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; vga: &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;u16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0xb8000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;u16&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;// red on black
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; style &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0x4&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span&gt;unsafe&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;vga &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; style &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;'H'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;u16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0xff&lt;/span&gt;);
        vga &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; vga.offset(&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);
        &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;vga &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; style &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span&gt;'R'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;u16&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;0xff&lt;/span&gt;);
    }

    &lt;span&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;code&gt;cargo-xbuild&lt;/code&gt; (it allows you to compile the &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; library to a specified target) to emit an object file that would later be linked with my bootloader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cargo xrustc --release -- --emit obj&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;hello_rust.o
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard you can also do it without &lt;code&gt;cargo-xbuild&lt;/code&gt; but I haven’t tested it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cargo rustc -Z build-std&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;core -- --emit obj&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;hello_rust.o
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I add the prefix to sections in &lt;code&gt;hello_rust.o&lt;/code&gt; and link it with the bootloader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;# add prefix&lt;/span&gt;
objcopy hello_rust.o hello_rust_prefixed.o --prefix-alloc-sections&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'.rust'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;# link&lt;/span&gt;
lld hello_rust_prefixed.o boot.o -T script.ld --oformat binary -o img.bin
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I run the emulator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;raw,file&lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;img.bin
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://micouy.github.io/img/hello-rust-qemu.png&quot; alt=&quot;QEMU screenshot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! If you have any questions, contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT: thanks to my gf sorry i forgot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;As hospitals across the United States brace for a difficult six months — with the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic still raging and concerns about a second wave in the fall — some are acutely short-staffed because of an ill-timed change to immigration policy and its inconsistent implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-aliens-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-following-coronavirus-outbreak/&quot;&gt;proclamation&lt;/a&gt; issued by President Donald Trump on June 22, barring the entry of most immigrants on work visas, came right as hospitals were expecting a new class of medical residents. Hundreds of young doctors were unable to start their residencies on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;Trump’s order included the H1-B visa for highly skilled workers, which is used by some practicing doctors abroad who get U.S. residency slots. The proclamation stated that doctors “involved with the provision of medical care to individuals who have contracted COVID-19 and are currently hospitalized” should be exempt from the ban, but it delegated the issuing of guidance to the departments of State and Homeland Security. That guidance has been slow and inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.0&quot;&gt;Many consulates started approving doctors’ visas on Thursday, after ProPublica asked the State Department about the delay. Others say they’re still awaiting guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;At hospitals where many incoming residents are visa holders, even a delay of a few weeks in arriving in the U.S. creates a staffing crisis. Doctors and administrators are afraid that the repercussions will last for the rest of the year — leaving them overworked and ill-prepared even before a second wave of the virus hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.2&quot;&gt;ProPublica has heard from 10 would-be medical residents stuck abroad because of H1-B visa issues. Six of them had gotten emergency consulate appointments for visa approval, but when they arrived for meetings they were told their visas could not be approved. Three were still waiting on DHS approval for their visas, a necessary step before a visa gets a consulate stamp. One resident had application approval but was denied an emergency consulate interview appointment because of the ban. All were destined for hospital positions treating COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.3&quot;&gt;The State Department told ProPublica on Tuesday that it, “in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security and interagency partners, is establishing and implementing procedures” for the visa ban, and that it “has communicated and will continue to communicate implementation procedures” to consulates abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;On Thursday, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/exceptions-to-p-p-10014-10052-suspending-entry-of-immigrants-non-immigrants-presenting-risk-to-us-labor-market-during-economic-recovery.html&quot;&gt;State Department’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/exceptions-to-p-p-10014-10052-suspending-entry-of-immigrants-non-immigrants-presenting-risk-to-us-labor-market-during-economic-recovery.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; posted guidance, spelling out that doctors treating COVID-19 patients were exempt from the ban. On that day, many of the residents ProPublica spoke to said they had suddenly received visa approvals. “A quite remarkable turnaround, given that I received a rejection email three days ago,” one said. In at least five countries, however, consulates were still not processing doctors’ visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;The Committee of Interns and Residents, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, has heard from over 250 interns stuck abroad. Over 150 of them are on H-1B visas.. (The others are on visas that weren’t covered in Trump’s ban, but can’t get approval because their consulates are still closed due to the pandemic.) Union president Jessica Edwards pointed out to ProPublica that while that number may sound small, each intern is responsible for the care of thousands of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.6&quot;&gt;As of 2017, there were 2,532 medical residents on H1-B visas, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association — though the Trump administration’s continued restrictions to legal immigration may have made it less appealing for hospitals to sponsor visas in the last few years. But the impact on hospitals is highly concentrated in the less-prestigious hospitals that tend to rely on residents from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.7&quot;&gt;At one New York City hospital serving low-income residents, nearly half the incoming class is still stuck abroad, multiple sources confirmed to ProPublica. One hospital in a large Midwestern city told ProPublica that “roughly half” of its first-year doctors started on time. In the Deep South, a region now overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, a doctor who was set to start told ProPublica he was among 10 residents still awaiting visa approval as of early July. All hospitals and doctors spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity because they worried about jeopardizing their visa applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;3.8&quot;&gt;ProPublica has also spoken to more-experienced doctors facing the same issue — including an infectious-disease specialist blocked from starting a job in an area of the Western U.S. where COVID-19 cases are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.0&quot;&gt;When there aren’t enough incoming residents to replace departing third-year residents, staffing crunches result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.1&quot;&gt;At the New York City hospital, a doctor told ProPublica that after only 10 days of short-staffing, one resident had called in sick from exhaustion. The doctor recounted a recent shift in which there had only been two junior residents on call, compared with the typical six. Even by having residents work individually instead of in teams of two, they couldn’t keep up with new patient admissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.2&quot;&gt;“The patients had to just stay there waiting in the (emergency department) for the residents to finish their first admission, in order to see them,” the doctor said. “When the shift was over, I logged into the computer and I would see notes written at 10 p.m., 11 p.m. And these residents are expected to go home and then come back again at 6:30 a.m.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.3&quot;&gt;Even at hospitals with decreasing COVID-19 caseloads, short-staffing is a bigger problem than it was in pre-pandemic times. Some hospitals are seeing a “surge of non-COVID patients” who were unable to get care for chronic conditions like heart disease during lockdown and are now deteriorating, a doctor at a short-staffed hospital told ProPublica. And because protocols prevent doctors from switching back and forth between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, the hospital needs to keep more doctors on-call to maintain staffing levels in both wards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.4&quot;&gt;“If someone is getting acutely ill, who will see them?” a hospital administrator told ProPublica. “I’ve got my poor residents running around trying to make sure everyone is seen in a timely manner. And residents are great, but they can only be in one place at one time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;Some of these problems will be fixed as residents receive delayed visa approvals and are able to come. But it will take weeks, if not months, to successfully onboard them. The Midwestern hospital anticipates that arriving residents may not be able to start until mid-August. In the meantime, they’re understaffing services and using fourth-year medical students in place of residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.6&quot;&gt;Hospitals are used to a summertime efficiency gap, as new interns learn the ropes. This year, it could persist into fall — when a second wave of coronavirus infections is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.7&quot;&gt;“I’m really worried that in three months,” said the medical administrator, “we’re going to have a bunch of residents who are just exhausted and just getting into the worst part of the fall, flu and COVID season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;5.8&quot;&gt;These doctors already had to push themselves through the first wave of COVID-19 this spring. Furthermore, at hospitals hardest hit by the visa ban, the residents picking up the slack are often themselves H1-B visa holders whose futures are now uncertain. Trump’s ban didn’t revoke visas for anyone currently in the U.S., but if they leave the country — which they will have to do if they change jobs — their ability to return is unclear. Some of the doctors interviewed by ProPublica were living in the U.S. before the pandemic and returned home partly to get visa approval for their new jobs. One doctor ended up stuck in India while her husband was unable to travel there from the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.0&quot;&gt;Another doctor from India, now working in the U.S., told ProPublica: “My parents, they’re (in India) by themselves, and both of them are about 70. At some point, probably, they will catch the infection.” If that happens, the doctor plans to leave the U.S. to care for them — “and if I don’t come back, I don’t come back. At this point, I really don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.1&quot;&gt;The feeling that the U.S. doesn’t value them is compounded among residents who’ve already lived through the first wave of COVID-19 and who are now facing overwork and visa uncertainty. Some said other countries are making it easier for doctors to immigrate, while the U.S. leaves them in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.2&quot;&gt;“We feel underappreciated for what we’re doing,” the New York City resident said. “And what else can you do, more than sacrificing your life?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.3&quot;&gt;Tightly regimented residency schedules can be tricky for H1-B visa holders even in the best cases. Doctors find out in mid-March if they are “matched” with a U.S. hospital, where they’ll be expected to start at the beginning of July. DHS often takes longer than that to approve H1-B applications. Employers can pay for expedited processing to guarantee a decision within five days — but DHS shut down its expedited processing on March 22 because of COVID-19 and didn’t reopen it until June 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.4&quot;&gt;Shortly afterward, Trump issued his proclamation banning entries on many visa types, including the H1-B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;Most people coming to the U.S. for residencies arrive on a different kind of visa, the J-1, and aren’t covered by Trump’s ban, though some have had issues getting consulate appointments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But doctors do identical work regardless of their visa types. If anything, doctors with H1-Bs are more qualified than those with J-1s, since they’re required to have completed all three phases of the taxing U.S. Medical Licensing Exam before starting residencies. Residents with H1-B visas were practicing doctors in their home countries, working alongside new medical-school grads from the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;7.6&quot;&gt;An earlier immigration ban targeting permanent immigrants, which passed in March, contained a broad medical worker exemption. When rumors of a work-visa ban started swirling in late spring, immigration lawyers and hospitals expected it would include the same language. Instead, the June proclamation mentioned only doctors working with hospitalized COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;ad-300&quot;&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.0&quot;&gt;Every resident who spoke with ProPublica had provided evidence to the U.S. government that they met that description. Some were told by consular officers that they were probably exempt. But until they received State Department guidance, they had to place their visas in “administrative processing” — an indefinite holding pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.1&quot;&gt;ProPublica saw an image of a form given to one visa applicant informing them of a hold. The form is typically used to request more information from the applicant. In this case, though, a consular officer had modified the form to say that processing would not begin until “implementation procedures” for the visa-ban exemption had been provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.2&quot;&gt;Doctors in limbo have formed WhatsApp groups to share information and support, but the dialogue has shown inconsistencies in the ban’s implementation. Some consulates, such as those in Serbia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, have approved doctors’ H1-B visas as exempt. Asked about the discrepancy, the State Department told ProPublica: “Applicants who believe they qualify for an exemption from Presidential Proclamation 10052 should check the website of the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate regarding the current status of services. How appointment systems are managed can vary depending on the consular section.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.3&quot;&gt;One applicant who reached out to the State Department for assistance received an email reply from an employee on July 10. The employee said that as far as they knew, the Office for Consular Affairs had given guidance to consulates and embassies to process visas that were exempt from the ban. (The agency declined to comment on that email.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.4&quot;&gt;On Thursday, that applicant received a second email from the same employee. Guidance had been slow in coming, the employee admitted, but it had finally come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype=&quot;copy&quot; data-pp-id=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;But some countries still haven’t changed their practices. One doctor stuck abroad told ProPublica they’d sent a follow-up email to the consulate on Thursday morning. “He gave me the same reply,” the doctor said, “that they are still waiting for guidance from Department of State.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Swiss Political System: More Than You Ever Wanted to Know</title>
<link>http://250bpm.com/blog:161</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://250bpm.com/blog:161</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Swiss political system may be best known for its extensive use of referenda. However, others may argue that its most striking feature is the ability to avoid political polarization. In this respect it may be unique among the western nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it is hard to learn much about how it works. First, a big part of the system is informal and thus only discoverable by observing it personally or by asking the locals. Second, it's strongly decentralized. Different rules apply in different cantons and municipalities which makes the topic confusing to study. Third, Swiss aren't especially interested in promoting their own system abroad. A lot of the resources therefore exist only in local languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I'll try to put together what I've learned by living in the country, speaking to local people, following local press and studying the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, a disclaimer is due: I am not Swiss. I have lived here only for five years. Neither am I a political scientists or a sociologist. If you are Swiss, or simply know better than me, let me know about any inaccuracies in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the more technical side of things: There's a lot of material to cover, and the result may be rather overwhelming. It would be a small book rather than a long article. Therefore, I am going to split this essay into three or four installments which I will publish one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When modern Switzerland was established in 1848, it was a pretty standard representative democracy, mostly based on the American model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a federal state. Federal elections are held every four years. People are represented by political parties. There are two chambers of the parliament. Parliament elects members of the government, who then together run the country. The thriving ecosystem of various voluntary associations resembles the America that Alexis de Toqueville has written about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Switzerland is special in that various elements of direct democracy were introduced in the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obligatory referenda: Any change in constitution, adjustment of taxes or joining any international organization must be approved by the people and the cantons. There are legislative referenda: Any law enacted by the parliament may be challenged and rejected in a referendum. Finally, there are so called &quot;popular initiatives&quot; which can propose a referendum on any topic. If the initiative manages to collect specified amount of signatures within specified amount of time the referendum is organized and the initiative may eventually get enacted. All of these referenda exist not only on the federal, but also on the cantonal and the municipal level. All of them are binding and neither of them needs a quorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the scope of the thing, consider that a 36-year-old from the city of Zurich who turned 18 in year 2000, has, in past 20 years, had the opportunity to take part in 548 referenda, 181 of them being on the federal, 176 on the cantonal and 191 on the municipal level. With the average turnout of 45% it means that they have voted in approximately 246 referenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their large number, individual referenda are not organized separately. Instead, they are voted on in batches, typically four times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a flavor of how it feels like, here's the batch from the city of Zurich in February 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;popular Initiative &quot;Affordable Housing&quot;: A sensitive issue especially in big cities like Zurich or Geneva, where rents are some of the most expensive in the world. The initiative proposes to build at least 10% of affordable, non-profit or cooperative flats, as well as a pre-emptive right for cantons and municipalities to buy land. It also proposes that infrastructure upgrades should be done without reducing the number of available flats. The referendum is held at the federal level. 46.5% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation: Switzerland has previously prohibited discrimination on grounds of race, religion, age or political affiliation. This proposal adds sexual orientation to the list. Federal referendum. 63.52% of in favor. Enacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Law on passenger transport in taxis and limousines: A law that introduces the same rules for Uber and similar services and for the traditional taxi services. At the same time, it moves the enforcement of these rules from municipalities to the canton. The law was issued by the government of the canton of Zurich and challenged by a public initiative. (Not the least argument being that the law gives too much power to the canton at the expense of the municipalities.) Cantonal referendum. 52.84% of in favor. Approved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rosengarten tunnel and tram project: A plan by the canton to put 1.1 billion francs into rebuilding the busiest street in Zurich and moving the traffic underground. The plan was challenged by a public initiative. Cantonal referendum. 36.32% of in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People 's initiative &quot;Reduce the tax burden for lower and middle income people&quot;: An attempt to reduce income inequality. The proposal adjusts the cantonal taxes by raising the threshold for non-taxable income, as well as by increasing the tax burden in the highest income brackets. Cantonal referendum. 42.04% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;popular Initiative &quot;Lower Taxes for Everyone&quot;: A proposal to reduce cantonal taxes for the highest income groups. The aim is to prevent the relocation of the wealthy people to tax havens such as the cantons of Zug or Schwyz. Cantonal referendum. 29.63% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Partial replacement of the tram depot in Hard district by new communal flats. The city proposes to take a loan of 203 million francs. Municipal referendum. 70.9% in favor. Adopted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The canton publishes a handbook for each ballot, which explains, in quite a detail, including graphs, maps and tables, what each referendum is about. Take the Rosengarten tunnel project. The guide devotes eight pages to explain the project, including topics such as the impact on the traffic situation in the canton, the impact on the environment, or a detailed explanation of the financing of the project. It states that both the cantonal government and parliament recommend voting in favor of the proposal. It is followed by the opinion of the minority in the cantonal parliament, arguing that the costs are too high, that the financial contribution from the federal government is uncertain, and that the project doesn't really address the existing problem. They recommend to vote against. The next page contains the opinion of the parliament of the city of Zurich. They argue, in rather strong terms, against the project. Finally, there's the opinion of the referendum commission, which is, as one would expect, against the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If even the election guide is not enough, you can have a look at the websites advocating for the yes and no vote, respectively. While the website against is relatively minimalist, the in favor side has a long list of supporters. In addition to almost all political parties, there's a long list of supportive associations: The Automobile Club, the Association for the Promotion of Public Transport, the Employers' Association, the Association of Construction Companies of Canton Schaffhausen, the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, the Property Owners' Association, Swiss Travel Club, Zurich Chamber of Commerce and the like. Many of these organizations have also published their own assessment of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen, the voters aren't exposed to a simple, black and white choice. Instead, they are drawn into a complex network of different preferences: Your party is in favor, but the deputies of your municipality are against. You are a member of the automobile club and the club is in favor. But your neighbors are against. Voting necessarily means understanding that things are never clear-cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any change to the constitution must be approved by the voters in a referendum. There's no way around it. If you want to change the constitution, you need the majority of voters and the majority of cantons to vote for it. Period. (To clarify: Canton is considered to be in favor if the majority of voters in the canton are in favor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may seem as a reasonable rule on its own, it is in fact an important piece that complements the overall system. The results of popular initiatives are, for example, written into the constitution, meaning that they can't be overturned, except by a different referendum. (On the other hand, it gives the Swiss Constitution a rather special character. It begins with the thundering: &quot;In the name of Almighty God! We, the Swiss people and cantons, mindful of our responsibility to the Creation&quot; etc., but then it ends with guidelines for the protection of swamps and rules for building holiday homes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Switzerland has no constitutional court. The right to interpret the constitution is granted only to the people. They may do so by running a referendum that makes the wording of the constitution more clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the system is crafted in such a way that there are no loopholes. No way to disrespect the popular opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the changes in constitution, referendum is also required to to join international organizations. This way, Switzerland decided not to enter the European Economic Area in 1992, to join Schengen area in 2005, not to join UN in 1986 and, again, to join UN in 2002. (And yes: Palace of Nations, the headquarters of UN, is located in Geneva and was located there for a long time even before Switzerland has become a member.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislative referenda get the least publicity but they may be the most important of all. Unlike constitutional referenda and public initiatives that tend to focus on big topics the legislative referendum can challenge and reject and law, no matter how trivial, passed by the parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This keeps the parliament and the government in check on day-to-day basis. To quote Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility for the citizens to challenge any law influences the whole political system. It encourages parties to form coalition governments, to minimize the risk that an important party tries to block the action of the government by systematically launching referendums. It gives legitimacy to political decisions. It forces the authorities to listen to all sectors of the population, to minimize the risk that they reject new laws in referendums. Before presenting a new bill to the parliament, the federal government usually makes a wide consultation to ensure that no significant group is frontally opposed to it, and willing to launch a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, legislative referenda are probably the single most important force that driving Switzerland away from the political polarization and towards the rule by consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular initiative is a way to partially change the constitution in arbitrary way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has already been said, if any proposal collects hundred thousand signatures in a year and a half, it is voted upon in a referendum. The result of the vote is binding and there is no &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum&quot;&gt;quorum&lt;/a&gt;. If just 1% of the population takes part and 0.51% votes in favor of the proposal, it will be enacted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there are no restrictions on the topic of the popular initiative. In some countries that have similar instrument in their constitution the topics are restricted. It may not be possible to hold referenda about basic human rights or maybe about taxes. Not so in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what a popular initiative means, let's have a look at a little sample. What follows are all the popular initiatives on the federal level that were voted on in the 2015-2019 election period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Stop urban spread.&quot; The Young Greens' initiative against suburbanization and for stricter zoning. 36.3% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Swiss law instead of foreign law.&quot; Proposal for the Swiss constitution to take precedence over international treaties. Referendum initiated by the Swiss People's Party. 33.7% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For cows with horns.&quot; The initiative initiated by farmer Armin Capaul. It proposes to subsidize the farmers who do not cut the cows' horns. 45.3% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For food independence.&quot; A complex proposal to support farmers. It includes a ban on genetically modified organisms. 31.6% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Fair-food initiative.&quot; The Greens' attempt to introduce restrictions that would promote fair, environmentally friendly agriculture and prevent food waste. 38.7% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For full-reserve banking.&quot; The initiative proposes that the Swiss National Bank should be the only source of money. Other banks would have to have cash reserves sufficient to pay out all the deposits. Initiative of the association &quot;For the Modernization of Currency&quot;. 24.3% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Against radio and television fees.&quot; Publicist Olivier Kessler's proposal to abolish fees for state-owned media. 28.4% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For phasing out nuclear energy.&quot; An initiative launched by the Green Party. It proposes to decommission all the Swiss nuclear power plants by 2029. 45.8% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For strong social insurance&quot; An initiative of the largest Swiss trade union. It demands to increase payments to the social insurance by 10%. 40.6% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For green economy.&quot; The initiative calls for the Swiss economy to function in a sustainable way. The government should set goals and report on how they are achieved at each session of the parliament. If the progress lags behind, additional measures should be taken. 36.6% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For universal basic income.&quot; An initiative was initiated by several individuals. It proposes an unconditional regular income for all. The amount of income and the method of financing should be determined by law. 23.1% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The so-called &quot;Dairy Cow&quot; initiative. It suggests that the entirety of the fuel tax income should be spent on road maintenance. 29.2% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Pro Public Service.&quot; The constitution should explicitly stipulate that state and semi-state organizations (post office, railways, telephone) are not run for financial gain. It also limits the salaries of the employees in these organizations. 32.4% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Stop food speculation!&quot; Young Socialists' initiative. It proposes to ban certain financial instruments in the area of ​​agricultural products. It orders the Federal Government to combat such practices also at the international level. 40.1% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;For enforcing the expulsion of criminal aliens.&quot; Initiative of the Swiss People's Party. The party was dissatisfied with the government's implementation of the successful referendum on the expulsion of criminal aliens held in 2010. 41.1% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Against fines for marriage.&quot; The initiative of Christian Democrats, who did not like that in some cases unmarried couples paid less taxes than married couples. 49.2% in favor. Rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small cantonal or municipal popular initiatives are probably not that interesting for a reader from abroad, but still, let's mention a few of them. In recent years, the voters in the canton of Zurich have voted on: Definition of marriage as a union of a man and a woman. For the expansion of the Stadelhofen railway station. For the replacement of hunting associations by professional nature conservationists. For the harmonization of school curricula in German-speaking cantons. For one, instead of the two, compulsory foreign languages ​​in schools. For the law to support for the film and gaming industry. For economic organizations to take part in funding kindergartens. For the abolition of the commission reviewing the claims of rejected asylum seekers. For effective control of minimum wages. All of those initiatives were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth looking at the history of popular initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When modern Switzerland was founded in 1848 there was a clause in the constitution that the people could change the constitution. It was generally interpreted to mean that the constitution could only be replaced in its entirety. The instrument of the popular initiative was not established until 1891.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the list of all the popular initiatives, we notice that the instrument of popular initiative was little used at the beginning. The number of popular initiatives soars only in the seventies. The graph shows the number of all popular initiatives in blue and the number of successful ones in red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://250bpm.wdfiles.com/local--files/blog:161/initiatives.png&quot; alt=&quot;initiatives.png&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that only by then did the instrument get working really smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, for example, the custom of &quot;putting the initiatives into the drawer&quot; has become established. The new initiatives were simply left in the vacuum, without a referendum, until they were forgotten, or until the initiative had lost all of its political relevance. One particular initiative was literally forgotten and canceled only after spending 43 years in a drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this system was heavily criticized in the press, the government eventually gave up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next trick was to make a government counter-proposal for a popular initiative and thus divide its supporters. If, say, 60% of the people were in favor of the initiative, the two proposals (the original proposal and the government's counter-proposal) divided them into two groups of 30% each, so that neither proposal passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem was solved in 1987 by the introducing so-called &quot;double yes&quot; which makes it is possible to vote for both the initiative and the official counterproposal. An additional question has also been introduced which asks which of the proposals one would favor if both proposals were successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, there is the problem of the validity of the referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss constitution does not limit the subject of the popular initiative in any way. The only requirement it makes is that it has a coherent content. In practice, this means that the voter should never be forced to say yes or no to a question that mixes two unrelated matters. (Example: Do you want Putin to be able to run for a president for two more election periods and adjust the state pension in line with the inflation?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for example, the popular initiative which called for a reduction in military spending and the use of the money for social purposes, was canceled. The government's argument was that the financing of the army and the financing of social affairs are two independent issues that cannot be conflated in one referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument sounds reasonable. But then one notices that some of the constitutional changes initiated by parliament are cheerfully mixing changes in various parts of the constitution. The system is unbalanced in this respect and the problem has not been solved yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the problem of the consistency of the proposal with international treaties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first historical case had to do with a contract with Germany about the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in Rheinau on the border of the two states. According to the contract, the concession could not be canceled unilaterally. When the government, in 1954, allowed the popular initiative for the abolition of the power plant, it opened up the question of what happens if a referendum contradicts Switzerland's international commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, Switzerland avoided embarrassment because the initiative against the Rheinau power plant has not been successful. In recent years, however, there have been couple of successful initiatives that contradict international treaties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them was the initiative for the automatic expulsion of criminal aliens in 2010. As the result of the referendum was never properly put into practice, in 2018 the original author of the initiative (Swiss People's Party) comes up with a different initiative proposing that the Swiss constitution - and therefore the results of the popular initiatives - should always take precedence to the international law - with the exception of those international treaties that were approved in a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a referendum pass, Switzerland could at any time revoke its existing international obligations and would be considered an unreliable partner abroad. Which, of course, could be a serious problem for Switzerland's export-oriented economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the referendum did not pass and so the problem is still unresolved. We can only guess how it will turn out. Maybe, one day, all international treaties will be voted on to gain unquestionable legitimacy. However, even this will not solve the problem of already existing international treaties and retroactive changes through popular initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, it is worth noting how the discussion is becoming more and more nuanced over the years. In the 19th century, it was disputed whether a partial change in the constitution through a popular initiative was permissible at all. Then we see the government openly sabotaging the legal instrument. Today, 130 years after it was introduced, the Swiss are finally dealing with the actual messy problems that the usage of popular initiatives entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common argument against referenda is that they are dangerous. Let's recall how Lukashenko entrenched himself in the power: The referendum in 1995 gave him the power to dissolve the parliament. In 1996, again in a referendum, Belarusians decided that the presidential decrees would have force of law. Finally, the referendum in 2004 extended the presidential term indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, for that matter, recall the Brexit referendum and the political chaos it plunged the UK into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this danger and the fact - quite noticeable in the previous sample - that 90% of the popular initiatives tend to be rejected, one has to ask whether Switzerland gains any benefits from using the instrument at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But contemplating it, one may wonder whether the fact that out of all 210 popular initiatives that were voted on since 1891 only 22 were successful isn't besides the point. Perhaps it doesn't matter how many initiatives are being rejected. Perhaps the only thing that matters is that there's a safeguard when a conflict of interest between the people and their elected representatives arises. In such a situation a popular initiative may adjust the political system in such a way as to align the interests of the representatives with the interests of the people anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we look at the successful popular initiatives, we see almost no cases of such initiatives. At least at first glance, it is not clear why the topic of swamp protection or the topic of the construction of holiday homes should lead to a conflict of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, two historical initiatives are an exception to the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 1917 Switzerland used to use majority system in the parliamentary elections. This led to a situation where the Liberal Democrats got only 40.8% of the vote, but 54.5% of the seats in parliament. The absolute majority allowed them to pass the laws, regardless of the will of the 59.2% who voted for other parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Liberal Democrats torpedoed every attempt to replace the majority voting system by a proportional one. If the instrument of popular initiatives was not available, it would be a dead end. The voters would have to wait until Liberal Democrats lose some of their voter support. But even then, thanks to the majority system, an absolute majority in parliament could be won by another party, who would again find it difficult to abolish the system that brought it to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General dissatisfaction with the state of affairs led to the launch of the popular initiative &quot;For a proportional system of elections to the National Council&quot; in 1918 which succeeded with 66.8% votes in favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1919, elections were finally held using the new, proportional system and Liberal Democrats lost the absolute majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second exception happened in the period after World War II. During the war, a state of emergency was declared, in which a large number of otherwise decentralized powers were transferred to the federal government. After the war, the government refused to relinquish those powers. In 1949, however, the popular initiative &quot;For a Return to Direct Democracy&quot; (50.7% in favor) returned matters to pre-war state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But however important those two exceptions may be, do they justify the existence of popular initiatives? To justify a powerful and dangerous instrument like that, one would expect to gain at least some day-to-day advantage rather than something that happens twice in a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that referenda, in fact, serve an important day-to-day purpose: They act as a sword hanging over the parliament and the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the legislative referendum. It can be used to block any law passed by parliament. The consequence, which, while obvious, does not occur immediately, is that the parliament simply does not pass laws that are apparently going to be challenged and rejected in a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, even a threat of referendum is enough to cause a change in the law or even let it be dropped altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, both the government and the parliament are very well aware of the possibility of a referendum and so they proactively make sure that no significant group of the population has a reason to block the new law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a zero quorum for a referendum means that even small minorities must be taken into account: If the law discriminates against, say, the hearing impaired, the rest of the nation may well ignore the referendum, but the deaf and deaf-mute will still be able to force its abolition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular initiatives complement the system: Legislative referenda can be used only to reject new laws. Popular initiatives can be used to challenge old and dysfunctional ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it's becoming clear why almost all popular initiatives are rejected. If the initiative had a obvious chance of being approved, the parliament would introduce the necessary legislation on its own. From this point of view the small number of successful initiatives is not a sign of a system malfunction, but rather a proof that the system is functioning the way it is expected to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases in happens, that initiative has a chance to pass, but the government or parliament considers it harmful or disadvantageous. In these cases, they can come up with a so-called counter-proposal. The counter-proposal is typically a compromise. If the initiative asks for 100, the counter-proposal offers 50. Voters can then choose between rejecting the initiative altogether, accepting it, or accepting the counter-proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, for example, the Evangelical Party of canton Zurich initiates a popular initiative for reducing the size of classes in schools. The initiative proposes a cap of 20 students per class. The cantonal parliament offers a counter-proposal in which it promises to create 100 new teaching jobs and distribute those teachers preferentially into municipalities that suffer the most from the problems with large class sizes. In the end, voters opted for the government counter-proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of the system of counter-proposals is witnessed not only by them being accepted on quite regular basis, but also by the fact that 73 federal popular initiatives were, in the course of history, withdrawn by their initiators in favor of the government counter-proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are yet more functions of popular initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the next one, consider the process that each initiative goes through: The Federal Council will first check the referendum and translate it into all official languages. Then, the signatures are collected. The limit for collecting a sufficient number of signatures is one year and a half. The signature sheets are then handed over to the Federal Council. The government has a year and a half to discuss the proposal. If it decides to file a counter-proposal, this period is extended by another year and a half. Consultations with experts and all the stakeholders are held within this time. The government prepares a detailed report and passes it to the parliament. Parliament has another year and a half to discuss it. In the case of a counter-proposal, the period can be prolonged to three and a half years. Finally, the government sets a date for the referendum, which must happen within the next ten months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole initiative, from the draft proposal to the vote, can therefore take up to nine years. In practice, this period usually ranges from two to six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process seems highly inefficient at a first glance, but when one listens to what Swiss political scientists have to say on the matter, it becomes clear that this sluggishness is not a bug, but rather a feature. Some even distinguish between a real referendum (in Switzerland) and a plebiscite (everywhere else). One important difference is that the long duration of the process, which spans across election periods, prevents the referendum from being used for tactical purposes. Another difference is that it provides ample time for in-depth public debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's a lot of debate. It is not just the consultations organized by the government and parliament. The referenda are discussed in the media, both in serious newspapers and in tabloids, which are handed out for free at tram stops. They are discussed among colleagues at work during the lunch. They are discussed within the family during the dinner. At night they are discussed in pubs and bars. Associations, companies, political parties, government, parliament, all kinds of organizations and individuals all recommend voting either in favor or against. Public discussions are organized. Every simpleton feels obligated to express himself on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When election day comes, one may get an election handbook that presents both sides of the argument, but at that moment, one's head is already filled of various arguments, both in favor and against. One has become, at least to some extent, an expert on the subject. (And if you think about it, the 548 referenda in Zurich in past 20 years mean that the educational aspect of the system may be surprisingly large.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put the above in different words, a popular initiative can also be understood as a call for a public debate on a certain topic. The fact that it is followed by a binding vote ensures that people actually do care about the debate. True, the vast majority of popular initiatives are rejected, but at that point there has been a public discourse and people are at least aware of the matter. With referenda on matters such as universal basic income or full reserve banking, one would expect widening of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window&quot;&gt;Overton window&lt;/a&gt;. However, I wasn't able to find a study comparing the size of the window in Switzerland and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can also think of the public debate as a safety measure. Particular initiative may be dangerous, if approved, but when people go to ballots they are already well aware of the danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another safety measure is that Swiss referenda are, in their essence, not polarizing. In referendum you are never asked to decide between two extremes, between, say, pro-life and pro-choice, but rather between the initiative proposal and the status quo. Voting against is always a safe and neutral option. It doesn't necessarily mean that you are not sympathetic to the spirit of the initiative. You may just think it's going too far, or maybe you like some aspects of it but don't like some other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the 2013 vote on the law granting special powers to the government in case of epidemic. Some people were against the proposal because they though it makes the federal government too powerful. At the same time they've kept quiet about it because they haven't wanted to be seen as part of the anti-vaxxer crowd which was dominating the debate. Luckily, voting against was a neutral choice they could take advantage of. It haven't meant that vaccination programmes would be relaxed. It just meant that status quo would be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of the Jurassic question begins after the Napoleonic Wars, in 1815, when the Jura region, traditionally part of the Principality-Bishopric of Basel, was annexed to the canton of Bern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jura, however, unlike Bern, is French-speaking and to make the situation worse, while the southern part of Jura is predominantly Protestant, same as Bern, the northern part of it is Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, starting in 1826, several separatist movements emerge in Jura, fueled mainly by religious frictions, the question of the separation of church and state, and later, to some extent, the nationalism based on the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Jurassic separatism dates back to 1947, when the Bern cantonal parliament refused to grant the position of construction minister to Jurassic politician Georges Moeckli on the grounds that he doesn't speak Bernese dialect good enough. That has opened the old wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following events are chaotic. The emergence of different opposition movements, mutual insults, demonstrations, public burning of a civil defense handbook, demolition of a statue of an unknown soldier, occupation of Swiss embassies abroad, bombs, paving stones and, unfortunately, several casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the whole range of events that accompany separatist movements around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, unlike in Northern Ireland, where the violence spiraled out of control at approximately the same time, Switzerland has succeeded - not least through the extensive use of the instruments of direct democracy - to keep the situation under control and eventually, if at the typical Swiss sluggish pace, to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't go into details here, but let's at least look at a short timeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1968: Establishment of two commissions (one bilateral and one impartial) to propose a plan to address the Jurassic question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 1970: The plan is approved in a referendum. The following referendums are proceeding according to the approved plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June 1974: Referendum on whether to create a new canton Jura. Approved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 1975: Districts that voted against the new canton in a previous referendum decide about their fate. The southern, Protestant part of the Jura decides to remain in the canton of Bern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autumn 1975: Municipalities at the border between the two cantons decide in referenda whether to join Bern or Jura.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 1978: In a federal referendum, the Swiss constitution is amended to list the new canton (82.3% of the vote in favor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the architectural beauty of the process. How the referendum is cleverly used to relieve the tension. Step by step, in cold blood, room for manoeuvre is taken from those who benefit from inciting conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the referendum on the process of resolving the issue was separated from the referendum on the issue itself. The fact that the process was approved in advance in a referendum gave legitimacy to the following referendums on specific issues and, the other way round, deprived the subsequent attempts to challenge the results of legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the fact that the process proposed by the preparatory commission had to be subsequently approved in a referendum created pressure in the commission to find a compromise solution. If they leaned too far to one side, there was a risk that the process would be rejected in the referendum and that the entire work of the commission would end up in the trash, along with the political careers of everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, note how, in the sequence of referendums, it were only those territorial units that voted against the winning solution, that got an additional vote. That prevented unending oscillation between Bern and Jura. The number of disputed areas kept constantly decreasing with each subsequent step of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the ongoing process siphoned the moderates, who would otherwise have no option but to join radicals, towards peaceful campaigning for the oncoming referenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events do not end with the creation of the new canton in 1979 though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the referenda above, the municipality of Laufen decided to remain in the canton of Bern, creating a Bern enclave between the cantons of Jura, Solothurn and Basel-Country. The events continued as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;November 1977: popular initiative &quot;Do you want to start the process of connecting Laufen to the neighboring canton?&quot; succeeds with 65% of the votes for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 1980: Referendum precludes Laufen joining the canton of Basel-City.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 1980: In yet another referendum, Laufen decides to start negotiations with the canton of Basel-Country (64.65% in favor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 1983: Unsuccessful referendum on joining the canton of Basel-Country. 56.68% vote against. Laufen remains in the canton of Bern. (A parallel referendum in the canton of Basel-Country approves the adoption of Laufen by a majority of 73% of the votes.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1985: A scandal with discovery of the secret fund to finance Bernese loyalists in Laufen. The Bern Parliament rejects the complaint of the citizens of Lausanne. They bring the case before the Federal Court. The court orders a new referendum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 1989: Laufen decides to join the canton of Basel-Country (51.72% in favor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 1991: Canton of Basel-Country votes to accept Laufen. The decision is less warm than in 1983, but the referendum still passes (59.3% in favor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 1993: Federal referendum approves the annexation of Laufen to the canton of Basel-Country (75.2% in favor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the question of the so-called Bernese Jura (Protestant parts of Jura that have not joined the new canton) is still not resolved to the general satisfaction. Separatist haven't yet given up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2012 the governments of the cantons of Bern and Jura agree to deliver a solution to the problem. In November 2013, two referenda are held, one in Jura, the other in Bernese Jura. The referenda pose the question of whether to begin the process of creating a new canton that would include both areas. Should the referendum pass, a commission would be set up to propose a detailed process, which would then be voted upon in a referendum. The preliminary idea was that every municipality in the Bernese Jura would vote on whether to stay in the canton of Bern or join the canton of Jura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the referendum succeeds in the canton of Jura (64.2% in favor), it fails in Berenese Jura (28.15% in favor). Thus, the question of the Great Jura is definitely off the table. Any further inciting of the Jurassic question loses political legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last painful spot is the town of Moutier, the only district in Bernese Jura which voted for the creation of the Great Jura (55% in favor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the previous referendum, the city of Moutier decides to hold a municipal referendum on joining the canton of Jura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;January 2016: The canton of Bern approves the referendum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June 2017: The referendum accepts the joining of the canton of Jura (51.72% of the vote in favor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 2018: The prefecture of Bernese Jura, complains about the irregularities in the referendum and declares the result invalid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 2019: After the Bernese court confirmed the abolition of the referendum, the city council decides not to pursue the matter in front of the federal court, but rather to hold a new referendum in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, if everything goes well, the Jurassic question will be definitively resolved soon, after more than two centuries of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 18th, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On Trouser Pockets</title>
<link>https://sambleckley.com/writing/pockets.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sambleckley.com/writing/pockets.html</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clothing industry rarely creates dramatically new patterns. It is more lucrative to make small, easy-to-manufacture changes that always use the same basic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is therefore lots of room to innovate clothing that is more appropriate for contemporary problems, because basic clothing patterns haven’t changed in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some trousers with unusual pockets, and I think they’re good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pockets-are-either-ugly-or-useless&quot;&gt;Pockets are either ugly or useless&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pockets in tight jeans look bad. Putting a modern slab phone, a wallet, and keys into a pair of skinny jeans will leave even the most fashionable figure looking looking like they’re wearing batman’s utility belt as underwear. Even empty, in tight pants a large pocket bag can show through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative, as many women know from first-hand experience, is a pocket too small to put anything in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wallet in the back pocket can cause back pain and bad posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us spend most of our time sitting, but all four traditional pockets are totally inaccessible in that position. So we take out our phone, just in case, before we sit down at the restaurant — guaranteeing a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesthetics, storage, and access: these are user needs that are currently poorly fulfilled — and that means things are ripe for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-brief-history&quot;&gt;A brief history&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the space is so ripe, why has there been no pocket innovation recently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women used to have pockets. That “used to” has to count back 150 or even 200 years, and those pockets were often a separate garment, either worn underneath and accessed through a slit in the dress, or worn around the hips overtop, rather than built into the dress directly — but regardless, “it has pockets!” as a joyous surprise is a modern invention. (Men’s pockets were also separate pouches if you go back far enough; but going back the same 150-200 years, they lived in the waistcoat and the mandatory jacket; if breeches had pockets they were behind the falls and so, I suspect, not used as much in public.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1880’s brought the 1940s brought the slow arrival of mass production to clothing — not of the textiles, which started much earlier, but of actual clothes. Before this era, clothes were made either at home, or they were made one at a time. (In a quiet resonance with today, this was done in part by women who worked almost entirely from home, only travelling to the workplace to pick up new work and drop off what had been completed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, fashions changed mostly decade by decade rather than year by year, but they changed dramatically. The fashionable silhouette of the 1860s looks nothing like the 1880s, or the 1910’s — so different, in fact, that for women the foundation garments were completely unrelated entities: the crinoline of the 1860s is nothing like the bustle of the 1880s. A person who can cut and sew can sew an incredibly wide range of different things; why not play around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the advent of mass production in clothes factories, the whole layout of the factory floor was based on specific pattern piecing. Each station makes only a few operations on each garment, and garments flow from one station to the next. To completely change the &lt;em&gt;construction&lt;/em&gt; of a garment means a radical overhaul of the whole assembly line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to simply change the garment’s &lt;em&gt;proportions&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so we live in a world where every spring the morning talk shows invite someone on to say “this year, [culottes, boot-cuts, skinny jeans, flares, cuffs, boyfriend jeans, high waists, low-rise, acid-wash, raw denim] are coming back into fashion, so keep your eye out!” — but the trousers are made from the same basic pieces, constructed in the same ways, with only the measurements changing. They get longer or shorter, looser or tighter, and change color, but they’re not fundamentally &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a lack-luster procedural generation system. Sure, there are technically millions of possibilities, but somehow you still end up bored after seeing the first 5 or 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not coincidentally, the advent of mass production is also when women’s silhouettes turned slim, and when all those foundation garments mostly disappeared. Designs that banish structure from the garment and rely entirely on the body beneath are much easier and cheaper to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when silhouettes turned slim, women lost pockets. The more body-hugging the clothing, the less room for pockets — or, rather, the more the pocket contents will show unflatteringly. (And as we know, it would be anathema for a women to show unflattering lump for something as silly as practicality, function, or utility.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even as womenswear adopted men’s workwear styles, women got jeans but not the pockets to go with them. Spandex made it even easier to make mass-produced clothes “fit”, and fit tighter. The unsightly-lump factor wasn’t going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more recently, menswear has returned to an incredibly slim silhouette. Guys in skinny jeans should, by this logic, not have pockets either. But they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women get no practicality and men get no grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-if-we-redesigned-the-pocket-from-scratch&quot;&gt;What if we redesigned the pocket from scratch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s design a trouser pocket! This process is going to land somewhere between UX and industrial design. I am, sadly, not in charge of a clothes factory, so I am not concerned with the problems of mass-production, but material properties and the construction process do still matter; but I am maybe more willing to make manufacturing sacrifices for usefulness than most industrial designers are able to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-people-use-pockets-for&quot;&gt;What do people use pockets for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storing things; most often phone, then keys, wallet or money-clip, and other small items. At the moment, a mask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verifying&lt;/em&gt; stored objects — the hip-slapping dance of making sure you have everything before walking out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They must be secure while standing, sitting, running for the bus, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things, especially phone, need to go in and out of storage frequently, almost unconsciously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to phone while seated in a restaurant; to keys and license while in car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aesthetically, we want a clean, graceful line from hip to ankle even while holding things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial solution can be based on just three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where can your hands reach?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is there extra space to put things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is there enough support to prevent items swinging around uncomfortably?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions form a physical venn diagram, pointing at a pretty small area for investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pocket_venn.png&quot; alt=&quot;The human body with overlapping regions of reach, space, and support.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that current pockets are located completely outside the area where there is potentially space; the hips and butt of modern pants, for both women and men, are closely fitted. If there’s any ease, it starts just above the knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, the point where the vastus lateralis starts to curve back in towards the knee, creating space, is also right around the lowest point your arms can reach without bending over, giving us a well-defined target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made a pair of trousers with no pockets at the waist, and a pair of welt pockets at the side seams, right at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pants1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;First pair of pants.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-from-user-testing&quot;&gt;Notes from user testing:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A pocket needs to be big enough for a whole hand, not just phone, to allow for fishing out small items from the very bottom of the pocket-bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pocket bag slips down and back if it’s full and the wearer sits down. This is uncomfortable and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pocket mustn’t allow a slick round phone to fall out when sitting, especially when, e.g. jiggling a leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;revisions&quot;&gt;Revisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, each of these notes point at simple revision, rather than the need to start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the pockets wider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor the bottom of the pocket bag to the side seam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angle the opening so it’s higher in the back — this both makes it easier to slip a phone into the pocket, and makes the pocket “deeper” on the bottom side when sitting or crouching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sambleckley.com/assets/images/pants2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Second pair of pants.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;outcome&quot;&gt;Outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are great. I completely forget my phone and wallet are there — they don’t restrict my movement, they’re completely invisible, and yet they’re easy to access while standing or sitting. There’s no temptation to slouch around with my hands stuffed in my pockets. They’re so straightforwardly better for my needs that I’m now frustrated when my new-pocket pants are dirty and I have to wear trousers with pockets that are just SO twentieth-century. I immediately made a pair of jeans in this pattern, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further revision is possible, of course; but while it will be easy to refine this design to suit my personal body and needs more precisely, there’s only so much refinement possible while remaining suitable for a wide range of body types. If you wanted to mass-produce a pocket like this, you’d want to use something like Dreyfuss’ Humanscale data to make sure the placement and size is appropriate for the widest range of people. Luckily, you’d have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; additional information in the sizing of the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of the pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-sam-have-you-simply-invented-cargo-pants&quot;&gt;Appendix: Sam, have you simply invented cargo pants?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Cargo pants solve different problems for different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If cargo pants are appropriate for your daily life, you definitely don’t want or need my side-seam welt pockets; and vice-versa. Cargo pants aren’t office-wear; these dress pants aren’t combat-wear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NoiseTorch is an easy to use open source application for Linux with PulseAudio. It creates a virtual microphone that suppresses noise, in any application. Use whichever conferencing or VOIP application you like and simply select the NoiseTorch Virtual Microphone as input to torch the sound of your mechanical keyboard, computer fans, trains and the likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to &lt;del&gt;like, comment and subscribe&lt;/del&gt; leave a star ⭐ if this sounds useful to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Screenshot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e14113424d7849e76922ce41cbc62816c9ed5911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5432774830626c2e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e14113424d7849e76922ce41cbc62816c9ed5911/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5432774830626c2e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/T2wH0bl.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then simply select NoiseTorch as your microphone in any application. OBS, Mumble, Discord, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9b97391d06aebb7e6a11398990721a3ad030e03c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7a5269366e70352e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9b97391d06aebb7e6a11398990721a3ad030e03c/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7a5269366e70352e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zRi6np5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two click setup of your virtual denoising microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single, small, statically linked, self-contained binary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Download &amp;amp; Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch/releases&quot;&gt;Download the latest release from GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unpack the &lt;code&gt;tgz&lt;/code&gt; file, into your home directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tar -C $HOME -xzf NoiseTorch_x64.tgz
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will unpack the application, icon and desktop entry to the correct place.&lt;br/&gt;Depending on your desktop environment you may need to wait for it to rescan for applications, or tell it to do a refresh now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With gnome this can be done with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gtk-update-icon-cache
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have a &lt;code&gt;noisetorch&lt;/code&gt; binary and desktop entry on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If noisetorch doesn't start after installation, you may also have to make sure that &lt;code&gt;.local/bin&lt;/code&gt; is in your PATH. On most distributions e.g. Ubuntu, this should be the case by default. If it's not, make sure to append&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if [ -d &quot;$HOME/.local/bin&quot; ] ; then
    PATH=&quot;$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH&quot;
fi
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to your &lt;code&gt;~/.profile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Uninstall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;rm ~/.local/bin/noisetorch
rm ~/.local/share/applications/noisetorch.desktop
rm ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/noisetorch.png 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the microphone you want to denoise, and click &quot;Load NoiseTorch&quot;, NoiseTorch will create a virtual microphone called &quot;NoiseTorch Microphone&quot; that you can select in any application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're done using it, simply click &quot;Unload NoiseTorch&quot; to remove it again, until you need it next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slider &quot;Voice Activation Threshold&quot; under settings, allows you to choose how strict NoiseTorch should be in only allowing your microphone to send sounds when it detects voice.. Generally you want this up as high as possible. With a decent microphone, you can turn this to the maximum of 95%. If you cut out during talking, slowly lower this strictness until you find a value that works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set this to 0%, NoiseTorch will still dampen noise, but not deactivate your microphone if it doesn't detect voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that you will need to reload NoiseTorch for these changes to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different problem with NoiseTorch, you can find a log file in &lt;code&gt;/tmp/noisetorch.log&lt;/code&gt;. Please make sure to attach this when reporting an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Latency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoiseTorch may introduce a small amount of latency. The amount of inherent latency introduced by noise supression is 10ms, this is very low and should not be a problem. Additionally PulseAudio currently introduces a variable amount of latency that depends on your system. Lowering this latency &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/issues/120&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;requires a change in PulseAudio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building from source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the Go compiler from &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;golang.org&lt;/a&gt;. And make sure you have a working C++ compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 git clone https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Clone the repository&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; NoiseTorch &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; cd into the cloned repository&lt;/span&gt;
 git submodule init &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Tell git to look at submodules&lt;/span&gt;
 git submodule update &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Update submodules&lt;/span&gt;
 make &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; build it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you build from source, it's recommended that you disable automatic update checks.&lt;br/&gt;In &lt;code&gt;~/.config/noisetorch/config.toml&lt;/code&gt; set &lt;code&gt;EnableUpdates = false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special thanks to&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>An update on our security incident</title>
<link>https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve been informing via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283518038445223936&quot; class=&quot;has-hover-card&quot;&gt;@TwitterSupport&lt;/a&gt; account, on Wednesday, July 15, 2020, we detected a security incident at Twitter and took immediate action. As we head into the weekend, we want to provide an overview of where we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we summarize the situation as of July 17 at 8:35p Pacific Time. The following information is what we know as of today and may change as our investigation and outside investigations continue. Additionally, as the investigation of this incident is unfolding, there are some details — particularly around remediation — that we are not providing right now to protect the security of the effort. We will provide more details, where possible in the future, so that the community and our peers may learn and benefit from what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, we believe attackers targeted certain Twitter employees through a social engineering scheme. What does this mean? In this context, social engineering is the intentional manipulation of people into performing certain actions and divulging confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attackers successfully manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter’s internal systems, including getting through our two-factor protections. As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets. We are continuing our forensic review of all of the accounts to confirm all actions that may have been taken. In addition, we believe they may have attempted to sell some of the usernames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/accessing-your-twitter-data&quot;&gt;Your Twitter Data&lt;/a&gt;” tool. This is a tool that is meant to provide an account owner with a summary of their Twitter account details and activity. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true. None of the eight were verified accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our actions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We became aware of the attackers’ action on Wednesday, and moved quickly to lock down and regain control of the compromised accounts. Our incident response team secured and revoked access to internal systems to prevent the attackers from further accessing our systems or the individual accounts. As mentioned above, we are deliberately limiting the detail we share on our remediation steps at this time to protect their effectiveness and will provide more technical details, where possible, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to our efforts behind the scenes, shortly after we became aware of the ongoing situation, we took preemptive measures to restrict functionality for many accounts on Twitter - this included things like preventing them from Tweeting or changing passwords. We did this to prevent the attackers from further spreading their scam as well as to prevent them from being able to take control of any additional accounts while we were investigating. We also locked accounts where a password had been recently changed out of an abundance of caution. Late on Wednesday, we were able to return Tweeting functionality to many accounts, and as of today, have restored most of the accounts that were locked pending password changes for their owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuing our investigation of this incident, working with law enforcement, and determining longer-term actions we should take to improve the security of our systems. We have multiple teams working around the clock focused on this and on keeping the people who use Twitter safe and informed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the attackers accessed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important question for people who use Twitter is likely — did the attackers see any of my private information? For the vast majority of people, we believe the answer is, no. For the 130 accounts that were targeted, here is what we know as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attackers were not able to view previous account passwords, as those are not stored in plain text or available through the tools used in the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attackers were able to view personal information including email addresses and phone numbers, which are displayed to some users of our internal support tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In cases where an account was taken over by the attacker, they may have been able to view additional information. Our forensic investigation of these activities is still ongoing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are actively working on communicating directly with the account-holders that were impacted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our next steps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we head into the weekend and next week, we are focused on these core objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restoring access for all account owners who may still be locked out as a result of our remediation efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing our investigation of the incident and our cooperation with law enforcement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further securing our systems to prevent future attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolling out additional company-wide training to guard against social engineering tactics to supplement the training employees receive during onboarding and ongoing phishing exercises throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, we also begin the long work of rebuilding trust with the people who use and depend on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re acutely aware of our responsibilities to the people who use our service and to society more generally. We’re embarrassed, we’re disappointed, and more than anything, we’re sorry. We know that we must work to regain your trust, and we will support all efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. We hope that our openness and transparency throughout this process, and the steps and work we will take to safeguard against other attacks in the future, will be the start of making this right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283518038445223936&quot; class=&quot;has-hover-card&quot;&gt;@TwitterSupport&lt;/a&gt; as our investigation continues. &lt;/p&gt;

<title>John Lewis, civil rights leader and congressman, has died</title>
<link>https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/17/john-lewis-obit-civil-rights-congress-036212</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/17/john-lewis-obit-civil-rights-congress-036212</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Tributes poured in late Friday night from across the political spectrum, with Democrats and Republicans offering condolences on Lewis’ passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“Today, America mourns the loss of one of the greatest heroes of American history: Congressman John Lewis, the Conscience of the Congress,“ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;In 2009, he was a witness to the inauguration of Barack Obama, the first African American president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“Generations from now,” Obama said when awarding him a Medal of Freedom in 2011, “when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind — an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;In 2017, he came under attack from Obama’s successor, Donald Trump. “All talk, talk, talk — no action or results,” Trump tweeted of Lewis as the two traded insults. Lewis subsequently invoked Trump to encourage his admirers: “Do not get lost in a sea of despair,” he tweeted in June 2018. “Be hopeful, be optimistic. Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;Through it all, the son of the deeply segregated Deep South had an outsize impact on public life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;story-enhancement has-borders&quot; readability=&quot;27.5&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote__text&quot;&gt;“What we found, as we pushed our protests deeper into the heart of segregated society, was that our nonviolent actions were met with increasingly more violent responses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote__authors&quot;&gt;John Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;John Robert Lewis was born in Troy, Alabama, on Feb. 21, 1940, one of 10 children of Eddie and Willie Mae Lewis. According to “March,” his three-part autobiography in graphic novel form, he dreamed from a young age of being a preacher. He was in charge of taking care of his family’s chickens and would practice sermons on them: “I preached to my chickens just about every night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;His early years predated the big burst of activism that would begin in the mid 1950s. “Growing up in rural Alabama,” he wrote in “March,” “my parents knew it could be dangerous to make any waves.” Even after the 1954 &lt;em&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/em&gt; decision, nothing much changed in his rural community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;As a teen, Lewis met both Rosa Parks and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1957, he went to the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, where he connected with some of the people who would become leading lights of the civil rights movement: Diane Nash, James Bevel, Jim Lawson, Bernard Lafayette and C.T. Vivian. (Vivian died earlier Friday at the age of 95.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“By the fall of ’58, my eyes were opening in many ways,” he wrote in “Walking With the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement,” his 1998 memoir. Lewis would help launch SNCC, an organization founded as an offshoot of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led by King and dedicated to the principles of nonviolence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;The movement had begun to blossom. It took a further step forward with the first sit-in in Greensboro, N.C., at a lunch counter at a Woolworth’s in February 1960. The Nashville activists were soon emulating the tactic, starting with lunch counters and moving on other establishments, such as movie theaters. During one sit-in, a restaurant owner turned a fumigating machine on Lewis and Bevel and left. “Were we not human to him?” Lewis wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“What we found, as we pushed our protests deeper into the heart of segregated society,” Lewis wrote in “March,” “was that our nonviolent actions were met with increasingly more violent responses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;In May 1961, Lewis headed south with the first Freedom Riders, an integrated group of bus riders who traveled from Washington to integrate the facilities of interstate bus terminals. Lewis was the first of the riders to be assaulted, during a stop in Rock Hill, S.C. He was punched and kicked. Lewis would be assaulted again in Montgomery, Ala., where he was knocked unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“I could feel my knees collapse and then nothing,” Lewis recalled, according to “Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice” by Raymond Arsenault. “Everything turned white for an instant, then black.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;For his trouble, he would subsequently be jailed, ending up in Mississippi’s notorious Parchman Farm. In the fall of 1961, however, the campaign yielded results: All interstate travel facilities were integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;“The fare was paid in blood,” Lewis wrote in “March,” “but the Freedom Rides stirred the national consciousness and awoke the hearts and minds of a generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot; story-text__paragraph&quot;&gt;SNCC veteran Cox said in 2020: “John’s fundamental belief of confronting the evils of segregation that was pervasive in the South allowed him to ‘march into hell for a heavenly cause.’”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Krita, OpenGL and Qt</title>
<link>https://valdyas.org/fading/hacking/krita-hacking/krita-opengl-and-qt/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://valdyas.org/fading/hacking/krita-hacking/krita-opengl-and-qt/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian Page first &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita/-/commit/4571e3f4722b2b3aa87f2915a35ee36e5bfe008a&quot;&gt;coded an OpenGL-based canvas implementation&lt;/a&gt; for Krita in &lt;a href=&quot;https://valdyas.org/fading/hacking/wow-2/&quot;&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. That was back in the Qt3 days. OpenGL was fairly simple back then, but we had to duplicate all our canvas handling code, once implemented in OpenGL, once implemented with QPainter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krita’s canvas code executes in three phases. There’s the image projection, that is, the result of combining all the layers, which is drawn first. Then we draw the canvas decorations: that’s the selection outline, the guides, the assistants, the reference images and so on. Then we draw the tool decorations: that’s the outline cursor, the line for the straight line or ruler tool and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, implementing all of that twice, once in  OpenGL, once with QPainter isn’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good Days&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we were elated when Qt4 appeared. Qt4 came with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpaintengine.html#details&quot;&gt;OpenGL based QPainter engine&lt;/a&gt;. This was ideal; we could split up our canvas code. The image would be drawn with pure OpenGL on a QGLWidget or with QPainter on a QWidget, and the canvas decorations and tool decorations would be drawn with QPainter on either canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Qt documentation even came with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtopengl-2dpainting-example.html&quot;&gt;nice example&lt;/a&gt; showing how this was to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The First Fly in the Ointment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Qt developers apparently saw the OpenGL QPainter engine more as a way to speed up the drawing of QWidgets than something that application developers would use. And the OpenGL QPainter engine never was able to render a complex application completely correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at some point, the engine stopped working on macOS. Mostly because Apple doesn’t want people to use OpenGL, so they’re starving their drivers from development, but also because the Qt developers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mail-archive.com/development@qt-project.org/msg32364.html&quot;&gt;thought that the OpenGL QPainter engine was a failed experiment&lt;/a&gt; because it didn’t improve performance when painting their widgets: they had forgotten that applications developers are using QPainter in their OpenGL applications. Or even told them not to do that. Though the documentation never reflected &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sucked, since we needed it, and in 2016 we had to spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/item/three-slots-awarded-to-krita-for-google-summer-of-code/&quot;&gt;a Summer of Code slot&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/R37:fe3821a9f1ce4f0b9acdd15458038dc006b92e4f&quot;&gt;fixing the OpenGL QPainter engine so it worked on macOS with OpenGL 3.2 Core Profile&lt;/a&gt;. That landed in Qt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;R.I.P Touch UI for Krita&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the migration from Qt4 to Qt5 something else happened: Qt4 QML was based on QGraphicsView. I’ve always suspected that QGraphicsView was created for companies that needed mapping software, but in the Nokia days there were several attempts to use QGraphicsView as a basis for a mobile ui framework, &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=34686&quot;&gt;DUI&lt;/a&gt; (best link I could find; there’s serious loss of history here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those attempts failed, until someone came up with QML, which initially was also rendered with QGraphicsView.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used QML to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/item/krita-on-the-go-krita-sketch/&quot;&gt;Krita Sketch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/item/presenting-krita-gemini/&quot;&gt;Krita Gemini&lt;/a&gt;. Because it was based on QGraphicsView, the touch ui we created worked seamlessly with our OpenGL-based canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Qt5 came out, QML was based on OpenGL and a scenegraph. We spent several months and quite a bit of money trying to integrate our OpenGL canvas in in the new scenegraph, but it just did not work. At all. It couldn’t be made to work, and Krita Sketch and Krita Gemini died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside: it was much harder than we had expected to port our OpenGL code from Qt4 to Qt5. It was a huge hassle, in fact.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Next Episode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Google Chrome happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of OpenGL drivers on Windows was always variable, sometimes even really bad. We had already encountered that when developing Krita Sketch, when we suddenly had a lot of Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google encountered the same problems with Chrome, and they implemented a solution: Angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angle seamlessly translates OpenGL into Direct3D. And once Chrome used &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, all their crashes were gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the GPU manufacturers had &lt;em&gt;no reason all anymore&lt;/em&gt; to fix their drivers, so they didn’t. Games would use Direct3D, Chrome used Angle, and pretty soon Qt added an option to use Angle, too, because otherwise QML-based applications on Windows would keep crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;strong&gt;excellent&lt;/strong&gt; news for us. We started using Angle, and the number of bug reports dropped a serious amount. And when we wanted to support HDR screens on Windows, the fact that we were using Angle already was great, because that enabled us to make HDR work, because on Windows, HDR can only be made to work when the window is rendered using Direct3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HDR patches still haven’t landed in Qt, so we are carrying them, along with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita/-/tree/master/3rdparty/ext_qt&quot;&gt;lot of other patches&lt;/a&gt; that are needed to make Krita work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regularly port those patches to newer versions of Qt5, but we make all our Krita binary builds with Qt 5.12, because every version of Qt since 5.12 has been too buggy to use. For example: with 5.15, using a QMdiArea in subwindow mode will hang on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the fact that Krita Sketch was still dead, and we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/T10784&quot;&gt;porting to Android&lt;/a&gt;, and a mobile UI would have been nice, everything was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Qt6 Drops Angle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, obviously, Qt’s Angle build option only  existed to make sure that QML apps would work on Windows, not for anything, Qt6 has dropped the Angle option…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there’s going to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6&quot;&gt;new framework&lt;/a&gt; which will use the various GPU API’s (Metal, Vulkan, Direct3D, OpenGL) directly with a abstraction layer (&lt;span id=&quot;hs_cos_wrapper_post_body&quot; class=&quot;hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text&quot; data-hs-cos-general-type=&quot;meta_field&quot; data-hs-cos-type=&quot;rich_text&quot;&gt;Rendering Hardware Interface&lt;/span&gt; ) above them that will be used to render the QML scenegraph. It looks like that’s all internal to Qt, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really hard to find documentation, but it looks like QPainter will render using those modules; but what isn’t clear is what will happen when we’re going to use QPainter on a QOpenGLWidget. Or would we have to implement a Metal canvas, a Direct3 canvas, and an OpenGL canvas? And will we be able to access the HDR functionality on Windows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or should we just patch Qt6 so it can be built with Angle again?&lt;/p&gt;
