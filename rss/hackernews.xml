<description>&lt;p&gt;We recently discovered that when you provided an email address or phone number for safety or security purposes (for example, two-factor authentication) this data may have inadvertently been used for advertising purposes, specifically in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.twitter.com/en/targeting/tailored-audiences.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tailored Audiences&lt;/a&gt; and Partner Audiences advertising system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailored Audiences is a version of an industry-standard product that allows advertisers to target ads to customers based on the advertiser's own marketing lists (e.g., email addresses or phone numbers they have compiled). Partner Audiences allows advertisers to use the same Tailored Audiences features to target ads to audiences provided by third-party partners. When an advertiser uploaded their marketing list, we may have matched people on Twitter to their list based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes. This was an error and we apologize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot say with certainty how many people were impacted by this, but in an effort to be transparent, we wanted to make everyone aware. No personal data was ever shared externally with our partners or any other third parties. As of September 17, we have addressed the issue that allowed this to occur and are no longer using phone numbers or email addresses collected for safety or security purposes for advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re very sorry this happened and are taking steps to make sure we don’t make a mistake like this again. If you have any questions, you may contact Twitter's Office of Data Protection through this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.ethicspointvp.com/custom/twitter/forms/data/form_data.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dark mode in CSS with `prefers-color-scheme`</title>
<link>https://tombrow.com/dark-mode-website-css</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tombrow.com/dark-mode-website-css</guid>
<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://tombrow.com/&quot;&gt;Tom Brow →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;header&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;September 27, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;40.213890596189&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site has a dark mode and a light one. Which mode you see depends on the setting of your device. Try it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;toggling dark mode in iOS&quot; src=&quot;https://tombrow.com/images/dark_mode.gif&quot; class=&quot;large&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The instant change in appearance is accomplished by this appendix to the style sheet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;@media&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prefers-color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#444&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#e4e4e4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#e39777&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grayscale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;30%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome among other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;light-on-dark&quot;&gt;Light on dark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important block is the one that overrides the colors of text and the background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#444&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#e4e4e4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's recommended to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme#avoid-pure-white&quot;&gt;avoid pure white&lt;/a&gt; for text, and I chose likewise to avoid pure black for the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;desaturate-colors&quot;&gt;Desaturate colors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accent color I use for hyperlinks looked harsh on the dark background, so I overrode it with a less saturated one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;#e39777&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographs also looked harsh. It turns out that many people prefer images, too, to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/dev-channel/re-colorization-for-dark-mode-19e2e17b584b&quot;&gt;desaturated in dark mode&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;grayscale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;30%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to use a more specific selector here in order to &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme#invert-vector-graphics-and-icons&quot;&gt;treat vector images differently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;read-more&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the above is distilled from &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme&quot;&gt;Hello darkness, my old friend&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomayac&quot;&gt;Thomas Steiner&lt;/a&gt;, which also contains a fascinating history of display color schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of more sophisticated WYSIWYG desktop publishing, the idea of making the virtual document resemble a physical sheet of paper became popular…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first ever browser, WorldWideWeb, displayed webpages this way. Fun fact: the second ever browser, Line Mode Browser—a terminal-based browser—was green on dark.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. widens trade blacklist to include some of China’s top AI startups</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-exclusive/u-s-expands-blacklist-to-include-chinas-top-ai-startups-ahead-of-trade-talks-idUSKBN1WM25M</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-exclusive/u-s-expands-blacklist-to-include-chinas-top-ai-startups-ahead-of-trade-talks-idUSKBN1WM25M</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include some of China’s top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities and ratcheting up tensions ahead of high-level trade talks in Washington this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, which drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, targets 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action bars the firms from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval - a potentially crippling move for some of them. It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] for what it says are national security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials said the action was not tied to this week’s resumption of trade talks with China, but it signals no let-up in U.S. President Donald Trump’s hard-line stance as the world’s two biggest economies seek to end their 15-month trade war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department said in a filing the “entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,” said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China said the United States should stop interfering in its affairs. It will continue to take firm and resolute measures to protect its sovereign security, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular media briefing without elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hikvision, with a market value of about $42 billion, calls itself the world’s largest maker of video surveillance gear. [L3N26T1DD]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SenseTime, valued at around $4.5 billion in a May 2018 fundraising, is one of the world’s most valuable AI unicorns while Megvii, backed by e-commerce giant Alibaba, is valued at around $4 billion and is preparing an IPO to raise at least $500 million in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other companies on the list are speech recognition firm iFlytek Co, surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology, data recovery firm Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co, facial recognition firm Yitu Technology and Yixin Science and Technology Co.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;STRONG OBJECTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the company “strongly opposes” the decision and noted that in January it retained a human rights expert and former U.S. ambassador to advise the company on human rights compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision’s U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy,” the company added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hikvision also said that it was assessing the potential impact of the blacklisting and was working on contingency plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;amp;d=20191008&amp;amp;t=2&amp;amp;i=1438369836&amp;amp;r=LYNXMPEF97031&amp;amp;w=20&quot; aria-label=&quot;FILE PHOTO: An ethnic Uighur demonstrator wears a mask as she attends a protest against China in front of the Chinese Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, October 1, 2019.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp, Ambarella Inc, Western Digital and Seagate Technology as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be “devastating”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blacklisting of Huawei has hurt many of its U.S. suppliers that depended on the world’s largest telecommunications company for revenue and made it difficult for Huawei to sell new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported in August Hikvision receives nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in revenue from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SenseTime said in a statement it was deeply disappointed by the U.S. move, that it abides by all relevant laws of the jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics to ensure its technologies are used responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megvii said it strongly objected to being placed on the blacklist and that it required its clients not to weaponize its technology or use it for illegal purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFlytek said its placement on the blacklist would not affect its daily operations, while Xiamen Meiya said its overseas revenue was less than 1% of total revenue and that most of its suppliers were domestic companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFlytek fell 2.7% and Xiamen Meiya lost 1.8% on Tuesday as investors factored in their limited exposure to overseas markets and the potential for the U.S. action to speed up restructuring, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China’s stock market has become increasingly immune to bad news from the trade war. No more panic selling,” said Stephen Huang, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hikvision and Dahua were suspended from trade at the companies’ behest. U.S. supplier Ambarella fell 12% in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the Trump administration also released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government’s restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The China Cultural Clash</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It all started with a tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It” refers to the current imbroglio surrounding Daryl Morey, the General Manager for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the latter’s dealings with China. The tweet, a reference to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong,&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/#footnote_0_4405&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_4405&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;This post is not about the specific issues driving the Hong Kong protests; it is useful to understand that China, particularly internally, has characterized the protests, which began when the Hong Kong government attempted to pass an extradition bill that would allow extradition to China, as a separatist movement driven by foreign powers. The protesters state their goals are not independence but rather that China honor its promises surrounding the transfer of Hong Kong back to Chinese rule, particularly in terms of universal suffrage&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people” (a rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/China-s-hard-power-and-hurt-feelings&quot;&gt;frequent occurrence&lt;/a&gt;). The Global Times, a Chinese government-run English-language newspaper, stated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1166183.shtml&quot;&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daryl Morey, general manager of the NBA team the Houston Rockets, has obviously gotten himself into trouble. He tweeted a photo saying “fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong” on Saturday while accompanying his team in Tokyo. The tweet soon set the team’s Chinese fans ablaze. It can be imagined how Morey’s tweet made them disappointed and furious. Shortly afterward, CCTV sports channel and Tencent sports channel both announced they would suspend broadcasting Rockets’ games. Some of the team’s Chinese sponsors and business partners also started to suspend cooperation with the Rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one rather glaring hole in this story of immediate outrage from Chinese fans over Morey’s tweet: Twitter is banned in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;China Started It&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I wrote about the uneven playing field between the U.S. and China when it comes to technology companies. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/&quot;&gt;China, Leverage, and Values&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I take the biggest issue with Culpan labeling this past week’s actions as the start of a tech cold war: China took the first shots, and they took them a long time ago. For over a decade U.S. services companies have been unilaterally shut out of the China market, even as Chinese alternatives had full reign, running on servers built with U.S. components (and likely using U.S. intellectual property)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the U.S. China relationship has been extremely one-sided for a very long time now: China buys the hardware it needs, and keeps all of the software opportunities for itself — and, of course, pursues software opportunities abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understated the case: not only were Chinese companies allowed into the U.S. while U.S. companies remained locked out of China, Chinese attacks on U.S. tech companies were allowed by China’s censors, and in fact even augmented by the Great Firewall. James Griffiths wrote about the 2015 attack on Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612638/when-chinese-hackers-declared-war-on-the-rest-of-us/&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper coauthored with researchers at Citizen Lab, an activist and research group at the University of Toronto, Weaver described a new Chinese cyberweapon that he dubbed the “Great Cannon.” The “Great Firewall” — an elaborate scheme of interrelated technologies for censoring internet content coming from outside China—was already well-known. Weaver and the Citizen Lab researchers found that not only was China blocking bits and bytes of data that were trying to make their way into China, but it was also channeling the flow of data out of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever was controlling the Great Cannon would use it to selectively insert malicious JavaScript code into search queries and advertisements served by Baidu, a popular Chinese search engine. That code then directed enormous amounts of traffic to the cannon’s targets…The cannon could also be used for other malware attacks besides denial-of-service attacks. It was a powerful new tool: “Deploying the Great Cannon is a major shift in tactics, and has a highly visible impact,” Weaver and his coauthors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack went on for days. The Citizen Lab team said they were able to observe its effects for two weeks after GitHub’s alarms first went off. Afterward, as the GitHub developers struggled to make sense of the attack and come up with a road map for future incidents, there was confusion within the cybersecurity community. Why had China launched so public an attack, in such a blunt fashion? “It was overkill,” Weaver told me. “They kept the attack going long after it had ceased working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a message: a shot across the bow from the architects of the Great Firewall, who—having conquered the internet at home—were now increasingly taking aim overseas, unwilling to brook challenges to their system of control and censorship, no matter where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects China was presumably targeting were Chinese versions of GreatFire.org, which documents censorship by the Great Firewall, and the New York Times, both of which were hosted on Github. Given the importance of Github to software development, China could not block the site completely, so instead they tried to hold it hostage. It was a harbinger of what happened this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dreams Versus Reality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story about engagement with China, both in terms of the U.S. generally but also tech specifically, has long been a belief that some engagement was better than no engagement, and that the shift to more freedom was inevitable. President Bill Clinton &lt;a href=&quot;https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/textonly/library/hot_releases/October_10_2000_6.html&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; when the U.S. established Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change this agreement can bring from outside is quite extraordinary, but I think you could make an argument that it will be nothing compared to the changes that this agreement will spark from the inside out in China. By joining the W.T.O., China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products; it is agreeing to import one of democracy’s most cherished values: economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people — their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added with regards to the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem. In the past year, the number of Internet addresses in China has more than quadrupled, from 2 million to 9 million. This year the number is expected to grow to over 20 million. When China joins the W.T.O., by 2005 it will eliminate tariffs on information technology products, making the tools of communication even cheaper, better, and more widely available. We know how much the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open society. Imagine how much it could change China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet. Good luck! That’s sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall. But I would argue to you that their effort to do that just proves how real these changes are and how much they threaten the status quo. It’s not an argument for slowing down the effort to bring China into the world, it’s an argument for accelerating that effort. In the knowledge economy, economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it turned out that China was able to first contain the Internet, blocking sites outside the Great Firewall, then control the Internet, censoring content on social networks like Weibo and WeChat, and, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/05/technology/china-propaganda-patriotism.html&quot;&gt;as this New York Times article explains&lt;/a&gt;, even leverage the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Communist Party indeed doesn’t hesitate to use state power to tell the Chinese people how they should think. But the displays of patriotism, especially from young people, also show that the party’s propaganda machine has mastered the power of symbol and symbolism in the mass media and social media era…While imposing tight censorship, the Communist Party has also learned to lean on the most popular artists and the most experienced internet companies to help it instill Chinese with patriotic zeal. It’s propaganda for the Instagram age, if Instagram were allowed in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem from a Western perspective is that the links Clinton was so sure would push in only one direction — towards political freedom — turned out to be two-way streets: China is not simply resisting Western ideals of freedom, but seeking to impose their own. Note this statement from state-owned broadcast CCTV, as it announced that it would not televise NBA games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defended Morey. “I think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear…that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,” Silver said in an interview with Kyodo News in Tokyo Japan. CCTV did not agree with Silver’s remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are strongly dissatisfied and we oppose Silver’s claim to support Morey’s right of free expression. We believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,” CCTV said in its statement in Chinese, which was translated by CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lever for this rather radical definition of “freedom of speech” is the China market. The Global Times editorial I linked to above could not have been more explicit on this point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respecting customers is a universal business rule. Morey has to choose between safeguarding his individual freedom of speech and protecting the Rockets’ commercial interests by respecting the feelings of Chinese fans. When he opted for the former, the Rockets will have to make a second choice from the perspective of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Morey, a private U.S. citizen posting an image on a social network already banned in China, had to be fired, or the Rockets and the NBA would quite literally pay the price. Abide by China’s standards, or else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The TikTok Question&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s exportation of its standards goes beyond brute force. Consider TikTok, the short-form video app owned by the $75 billion Chinese startup ByteDance, which has exploded onto Western markets over the last year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing&quot;&gt;The Guardian reported&lt;/a&gt; last last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social network, instructs its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, according to leaked documents detailing the site’s moderation guidelines. The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelations come amid rising suspicion that discussion of the Hong Kong protests on TikTok is being censored for political reasons: a Washington Post report earlier this month noted that a search on the site for the city-state revealed “barely a hint of unrest in sight”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, at least as of this afternoon, there is a hint of unrest on the site: while searches for “Hong Kong” show city views and high school students playing along with the latest TikTok meme, searching for Hong Kong in Chinese (香港) brings up a video that shows the protestors as hooligans and vandals (this was the first result as of this afternoon, and the only video relating to the protests):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-hongkong-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-hongkong-1-1024x734.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Honk Kong on TikTok&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;459&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-4410&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-hongkong-1-1024x734.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-hongkong-1-300x215.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-hongkong-1-768x550.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-hongkong-1-879x630.jpg 879w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-hongkong-1.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appear to be similar efforts in the case of the NBA controversy. Searching for the “Warriors”, “Lakers”, and “Rockets” brings up the sort of content you would expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-english-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-english-1-1024x734.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NBA teams in Chinese on TikTok&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;459&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-4412&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-english-1-1024x734.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-english-1-300x215.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-english-1-768x551.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-english-1-878x630.jpg 878w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-english-1.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, searching for the same team names in Chinese (“勇士”, “湖人”, and “火箭”, respectively) shows basketball-related results for the first two and nothing related for the third:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-chinese-2-copy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-chinese-2-copy-1024x734.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tiktok searches for NBA teams&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;459&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-4414&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-chinese-2-copy-1024x734.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-chinese-2-copy-300x215.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-chinese-2-copy-768x551.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-chinese-2-copy-878x630.jpg 878w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiktok-nba-chinese-2-copy.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should raise serious concern in the United States and other Western countries: is it at all acceptable to have a social network that has a demonstrated willingness to censor content under the control of a country that has clearly different views on what constitutes free speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an established route for undoing this state of affairs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-grindr-m-a-beijingkunlun/chinas-kunlun-tech-agrees-to-u-s-demand-to-sell-grindr-gay-dating-app-idUSKCN1SJ28N&quot;&gt;earlier this summer&lt;/a&gt; China’s Kunlun Tech Company agreed to divest Grindr under pressure from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS); Kunlun Tech had acquired Grindr without undergoing CFIUS review. TikTok similarly acquired Musical.ly without oversight and relaunched it as TikTok for the Western market; it is worth at least considering the possibility of a review given TikTok’s apparent willingness to censor content for Western audiences according to Chinese government wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The NBA’s Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, ultimately did do the right thing. In response to that CCTV cancellation Silver released a new statement that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1181497808563658752&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA — and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game¬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is inevitable that people around the world — including from America and China — will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver added in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NBA/status/1181499239626661888?s=20&quot;&gt;a press conference&lt;/a&gt; following the statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason I issued the statement I did is because this afternoon, CCTV announced that because of my remarks supporting Daryl Morey’s freedom of expression, not the substance of this statement but his freedom of expression, they were no longer going to air the Lakers-Nets preseason games that are scheduled for later this week. Again, it’s not something we expected to happen. I think it’s unfortunate. But if that’s the consequence of us adhering to our values, we still feel it’s critically important we adhere to those values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly convinced this is the point every company dealing with China will reach: what matters more, money or values?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;China Responses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not particularly excited to write this article. My instinct is towards free trade, my affinity for Asia generally and Greater China specifically, my welfare enhanced by staying off China’s radar. And yet, for all that the idea of being a global citizen is an alluring concept and largely my lived experience, I find in situations like this that I am undoubtedly a child of the West. I do believe in the individual, in free speech, and in democracy, no matter how poorly practiced in the United States or elsewhere. And, in situations like this weekend, when values meet money, I worry just how many companies are capable of choosing the former?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NBA, to its immense credit, appears to have done just that. Will technology companies be so brave? Certainly Google did so once before, exiting China in 2010 (albeit after both losing share to Baidu and being attacked by Chinese hackers). At the same time, the company appeared eager to reverse its decision, only terminating “Project Dragonfly” earlier this year; similarly, Facebook worked earnestly for approval — its product team built a censorship apparatus and CEO Mark Zuckerberg learned Chinese — only to give up last year. Both decisions appear motivated by the certainty of failure as opposed to core values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is Apple: the company is deeply exposed to China both in terms of sales and especially when it comes to manufacturing. The reality is that, particularly when it comes to the latter, Apple doesn’t have anywhere else to go. That, though, is where the company’s massive cash stockpile and ability to generate more comes in handy: it is past time for the company to start spending heavily to build up alternatives. Sticking one’s corporate head in the sand, praying that President Trump will not be re-elected and that everything will go back to normal, is deeply irresponsible both to shareholders and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/apple-versus-project-zero-apples-poor-response-the-china-paradox/&quot;&gt;to the values&lt;/a&gt; Apple claims motivates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government response is also critical: I already argued that CFIUS should revisit TikTok’s acquisition of Musical.ly; the current skepticism around all Chinese investment in the United States should be continued if not increased. Attempts by China to leverage market access into self-censorship by U.S. companies should also be treated as trade violations that are subject to retaliation. Make no mistake, what happened to the NBA this weekend is nothing new: similar pressure has befallen multiple U.S. companies, often about content that is outside of China’s borders (Taiwan and Hong Kong, for example, being listed in drop-down menus for hotels or airlines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest, shift, though, is a mindset one. First, the Internet is an amoral force that reduces friction, not an inevitable force for good. Second, sometimes different cultures simply have fundamentally different values. Third, if values are going to be preserved, they must be a leading factor in economic entanglement, not a trailing one. This is the point that Clinton got the most wrong: money, like tech, is amoral. If we insist it matters most our own morals will inevitably disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;footnote_0_4405&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This post is not about the specific issues driving the Hong Kong protests; it is useful to understand that China, particularly internally, has characterized the protests, which began when the Hong Kong government attempted to pass an extradition bill that would allow extradition to China, as a separatist movement driven by foreign powers.

&lt;p&gt;A ‘Bulls &amp;amp; Bears’ panel discusses Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting his support for Hong Kong protesters and the controversy following it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NBA’s multibillion-dollar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxbusiness.com/category/nba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;business relationship&lt;/a&gt; with China faces unprecedented pressure this week after a tweet by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports/rockets-general-managers-hong-kong-comments-anger-china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kicked off&lt;/a&gt; an international debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-container mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue Reading Below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned Chinese broadcaster CCTV and digital platform Tencent said Tuesday they have suspended planned broadcasts of NBA preseason games over Morey’s now-deleted tweet, which expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The tweet drew a public rebuke from Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and an apologetic initial statement from the NBA, which, in turn, rankled several U.S. politicians who felt the league had sided with financial interests over human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;item item-related-content&quot;&gt;&lt;header class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;MORE ON THIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlash placed strain on one of the NBA’s most lucrative corporate partnerships – the five-year deal with Tencent to stream NBA games in China said to be worth $1.5 billion. Several other sponsors, including sportswear brand Li-Ning, smartphone maker Vivo, the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and the Chinese Basketball Association all suspended their work with the Rockets or the NBA over the tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,” Morey wrote in a statement on Twitter. “My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The NBA has spent the last two decades cultivating a devoted fan base in China. The league’s business in the country is worth more than $4 billion as of 2018, or $133 million to each NBA franchise, according to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the potential financial impact isn’t limited to the Rockets. The NBA 2K League, the league’s esports venture and a major investment, recently announced plans to partner with Gen.G to place a franchise in Shanghai – the first time the NBA has placed a team outside North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if those plans are in jeopardy given current tensions. Representatives for the 2K League and Gen.G did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate developed as top NBA officials tour Asia as part of a preseason promotional slate. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is set to speak at a press conference in Shanghai on Thursday. The Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers are scheduled to play preseason games in China on Thursday and Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing mounting pressure, the NBA acknowledged in a statement last Sunday that Morey’s tweet had “offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals’ educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,” NBA Chief Communications Offer Mike Bass said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai, who co-founded Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, said that Morey’s tweet had touched a “third-rail issue” in China and was “so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several politicians, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ripped the NBA for a response they deemed had failed to support Morey’s right to free speech and the pursuit of democratic values in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver attempted to clarify the league's position in a statement early Tuesday, acknowledging that the league's initial response &quot;left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is inevitable that people around the world -- including America and China -- will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,&quot; Silver said. &quot;However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate inflamed U.S.-China tensions amid a lengthy trade war that sparked retaliatory tariffs between the two nations. Top diplomats are set to meet in Washington, D.C. this week to discuss a potential resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Morey’s tweet and the NBA’s handling of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefighting foam leaves toxic legacy in Californians’ drinking water</title>
<link>https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-10-08/firefighting-foam-leaves-toxic-legacy-california-water</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-10-08/firefighting-foam-leaves-toxic-legacy-california-water</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It was a Sunday tradition at Bethany Slavic Missionary Church. After morning services, Florin Ciuriuc joined the line of worshipers waiting to fill their jugs with gallons of free drinking water from a well on the property, a practice church leaders had encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take it for my office every week,” said Ciuriuc, a 50-year-old Romanian immigrant and a founding member of the largely Russian-speaking church, which claims 7,000 congregants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church leaders boasted it was the cleanest water in Sacramento, according to Ciuriuc. In fact, test results showed the water contained toxic chemicals from firefighting foam used for decades on a now-shuttered Air Force base a mile away. Church leaders say they did not understand their well was contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church’s well is one of thousands of water sources located on and near military bases polluted with chemicals from the foam, which was used by the armed services since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense Department officials know that the chemicals, called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, have seeped into the groundwater underneath nearly two dozen military bases throughout the state. But the department has conducted only limited testing off base and cannot say how many civilian water sources they’ve polluted or who will pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, when the Environmental Protection Agency classified PFAS as an “emerging contaminant” linked to liver cancer and other health problems, the Pentagon has found the pollutants at levels above federal health guidelines in soil and groundwater at more than 90 bases nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California has the most of any state, with contamination at 21 bases, including six where the chemicals threaten the water supply in nearby communities, according to a review of hundreds of pages of Defense Department records by the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Riverside County, Barstow, Orange County and Sacramento, PFAS have been detected in private wells or public water systems outside the boundaries of military installations, records show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;GoogleDfpAd-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos and Fresno Air National Guard Base, the chemicals are suspected of moving into the community water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One military contractor warned in September that residents “using groundwater for drinking water” near Los Alamitos “may potentially be exposed to migrating PFAS contamination.” Another contractor said in March that five wells west of the Fresno airfield could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Pentagon has not completed off-base testing at either location, and at other California bases, leaving the full extent of the contamination unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon faces the prospect of a gigantic environmental cleanup that officials estimate could cost in excess of $2 billion and take decades to complete. The day Defense Secretary Mark Esper took office in July, he appointed a task force to oversee the Pentagon response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever they have already found PFAS in drinking water above the EPA health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, the military has supplied bottled water, paid for filters and purchased clean water for both military personnel and civilians, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our first priority is to cut off human exposure, and everywhere we’ve identified that someone’s drinking water is above the EPA health advisory level, we are doing everything we can to provide alternative drinking water,” Maureen Sullivan, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing limited funds from Congress for cleanup and testing, the Defense Department only acts when water sampling finds contamination levels above EPA health advisory level for two of the most common variations of PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threshold, which was set in 2016, is nonbinding, and officials in several states have set much more stringent standards. Congress is currently debating whether to force the Trump administration to adopt an enforceable nationwide standard, a proposal the White House has said it opposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California regulators have few legal tools to force the Pentagon to expand its sampling to groundwater near bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing everything we can to compel the owner, the Department of Defense, to conduct the investigations, to show us it’s not a problem,” said Doug Smith, assistant executive officer with Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, which monitors groundwater at seven California bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research organization, about 85% of Californians depend on groundwater for some portion of their water supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators and environmental groups warn that the slow pace of Pentagon testing has left an unknown number of people drinking contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PFAS plumes are spreading near these military bases, and DOD is turning a blind eye,” said Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics, an environmental group that has pushed for more stringent PFAS cleanup standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘Forever chemicals’ spread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the chemicals have been found at 401 current and former military bases. When testing was conducted off-base, the pollutants were found in 1 in 4 wells and water systems, according to a 2018 Pentagon report to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them is the well at Ruben Mendez’s home in the Inland Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendez said he had no reason to think something was wrong with his well water until Air Force officials knocked on his door a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said, ‘We spilled something, and you need to stop drinking the water for a while,’” Mendez said in an interview on the front porch of his peach-colored home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, when the Mendez family built the ranch-style home that Ruben, 64, and his 91-year-old mother now share, they settled on property about a mile southeast of March Air Reserve Base. They had a private well dug more than 400 feet down, and for years authorities came every few months to test the water. Mendez said he attributed these visits to his home’s proximity to the base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, after the EPA set its health advisory, officials abruptly told the Mendezes and another family nearby to stop drinking the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We thought we had nice, clean water,” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, the Air Force “immediately contacted the two private well owners, provided them with bottled water and advised them not to use the well for any consumption purposes,” Air Force spokesman Mark Kinkade said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Air Force delivered free five-gallon jugs of water to the Mendez home for more than two years. In 2018, it paid to have the house connected to the municipal water system. Ruben Mendez said he now pays $100 a month for water he used to get for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toxic plume that spread from the base has also made its way into the public drinking-water system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eastern Municipal Water District, which supplies a swath of the Inland Empire that is home to some 825,000 people — from Temecula to Moreno Valley and Perris to Hemet — closed one of its large supply wells in 2016 when the EPA set its new health advisory level for the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We took that well out of service the same day,” said Lanaya Alexander, the water district’s senior director of water resources planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the chemicals had spread further south. In February, after a second well tested above California’s notification level, the district shut it down too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An emerging health threat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often referred to as “forever chemicals,” PFAS can persist indefinitely in the ground and water, be absorbed into people’s blood and accumulate in their bodies for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states and public health advocates say PFAS are harmful at much lower levels than the federal health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion. California requires state regulators to be notified at levels as low as 5.1 parts per trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, a new state law will mandate that customers be told if any of the chemicals are detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contamination from these chemicals come from many sources, not just aircraft foam. They were widely used in commercial products like nonstick pans, waterproof clothing and food packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Southern California, a major source of the pollutants is believed to be chrome-plating factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most vulnerable are mothers and young children, whose reproductive and developmental health can be altered by even tiny amounts of the chemicals being passed to fetuses during pregnancy and to nursing infants through breast milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since only small amounts can be absorbed through the skin, the greatest risk of exposure is from drinking contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefighting foam is considered a major contributor to the contamination, because it contains high concentrations of PFAS. Developed by the Navy and 3M Co., the chemicals create a film that cools burning aircraft fuel and blankets flammable vapors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of concerns about PFAS contamination, the Pentagon promised in 2016 that it would phase out use of firefighting foam. It has halted its use in training, but continues to apply it in aircraft fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Chris Gardner / Associated Press)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of concerns about PFAS contamination, the Pentagon promised in 2016, after the EPA issued its health advisory, that it would phase out use of the foam. It has halted its use in training, but continues to apply it in aircraft fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outrage over PFAS contamination has been building in the Midwest and on the East Coast for years, where companies like 3M, DuPont and its spin-off, the Chemours Co., which made the chemicals, have sought to &lt;span class=&quot;Link&quot;&gt;downplay their health risks&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has set some of the toughest PFAS drinking-water limits in the country. Pennsylvania has tested the blood of residents in heavily-affected areas to measure their exposure. New Mexico’s attorney general sued the Air Force this year to compel the military to pay for the cleanup of two contaminated bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in California, which state regulators say does not have any companies that manufactured PFAS, the scope of the contamination is only beginning to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California regulators have launched a multi-part investigation, focusing first on more than 600 drinking-water wells located within one or two miles of commercial airports and municipal landfills, where discarded household items release the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They plan to widen their search in the coming months, sampling water from wells near military bases and manufacturing plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to take it case by case,” said Dan Newton of the state Water Resources Control Board. “Where we find hot spots, we may chase those out further to identify plumes or areas of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foam is tested at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Gina Chiaverotti / U.S. Air Force)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High levels found, but not enough testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the California bases with the highest levels of on-base contamination, Edwards Air Force Base, has carried out little testing off-site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vast aircraft testing facility in the high desert north of Lancaster, Edwards has 24 contaminated sites where firefighting foam was sprayed heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a training site where firefighters practiced dousing flames with the toxic foam, the contamination level in soil samples reached 18,000 parts per trillion, more than 250 times higher than the EPA threshold, according to a contractor’s 2018 report to the Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests of the base’s drinking water did not show high readings. Still, the environmental testing company hired by the military called for further investigation into whether chemicals from the foam were leaching into the groundwater, noting at least “39 off-base water supply wells are within a 4-mile radius” of a contaminated site at Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal and state regulators agreed that more testing was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the EPA complained in an email to base authorities that while the base was conducting limited testing, it had made “no commitment to ensure the nature and extent of … PFAS contamination is investigated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California’s Department of Toxic Substances Control recommended in a July 22 letter to base officials that the Air Force expand its testing to include off-base wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanford Nax, a spokesman for the agency, acknowledged that regulators were concerned about “the limited nature of the sampling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Air Force is preparing to do further on-base testing next month near the base’s northern boundary, it said in a statement. None of the 24 contaminated sites found at the base to date “are in close proximity to any on-base or off-base drinking water wells,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future sampling finds contaminated drinking water that exceeds the EPA recommended level, “we will immediately provide alternate drinking water to impacted residences and facilities and begin working with the community and state regulators,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other bases have even higher PFAS contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station, a massive Navy testing facility and airfield near Ridgecrest, groundwater samples in 2017 turned up PFAS levels of 8 million parts per trillion, the highest in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sampling in 2017 at Naval Base Ventura County found PFAS contamination of 1.08 million parts per trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And near San Francisco, at Naval Air Station Alameda, the levels reached 336,000 parts per trillion, while at Marine Corps Air Station Tustin, a shuttered base in Orange County, samples were as high as 770,000 parts per trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently released Pentagon documents obtained through a public records request by the Environmental Working Group, an environmental advocacy group, showed three more bases in California with elevated contamination levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include Joint Forces Training Base, a California National Guard airfield in Los Alamitos, and Ft. Hunter Liggett, an Army training base in southern Monterey County. The third, Sierra Army Depot, a military storage facility, is located north of Lake Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the military has tested on-base at all of the facilities, their response to the spreading of the contaminants to off-base drinking supplies has been spottier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California regulators say there is little they can do to speed up the military’s testing or cleanup efforts around its contaminated bases. Because the EPA has delayed setting a standard for cleaning up groundwater contamination, the military has avoided large-scale remediation costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mather Airport, the former site of Mather Air Force Base, is a mile from Bethany Slavic Missionary Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Max Whittaker / For The Times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Growing frustration with Pentagon response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rancho Cordova, a city of more than 72,000 people just east of Sacramento that abuts the former Mather Air Force Base, a drinking-water well owned by the California American Water Co., one of four utilities that sells water to the town’s residents, has been contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City Manager Cyrus Abhar said that when the tainted water was discovered, the Air Force assured him it would deal with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Air Force is not going to leave the local communities holding the bag,” Abhar said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But several years after test results showed high PFAS readings, the Air Force has largely evaded responsibility for removing the contaminant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, California American Water has spent $1.3 million to build a treatment plant that filters PFAS out of the groundwater. The Air Force has not reimbursed it for this expense, said Evan Jacobs, a California American Water spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Air Force said, “Congress has provided no authority” to pay for constructing the facility, but that it was in negotiations with the company to pay for its operation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sign of growing frustration with the Defense Department, the company has filed a property damage claim against the Air Force — a first step before a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Miller, California American Water’s senior director of water quality, warned regulators at a meeting of the State Water Resources Control Board last spring that the Mather PFAS plume could grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The risk of PFAS contamination continuing to spread in the groundwater basin underneath the city of Rancho Cordova is increasing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no one acted to prevent it, Miller said, the chemicals could leach into five more drinking-water wells within the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pollutants have already reached Bethany Slavic Missionary Church, which is housed in a former health club a mile from Mather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deep well on the property supplies the Pentecostal church with its drinking water and is used to fill an outdoor swimming pool for baptisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciuriuc, one of the church’s founders, said he had no idea the Air Force was regularly testing the well for PFAS — or that the tests showed the contaminant level had risen from 14 parts per trillion in 2016 to 50 parts per trillion two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Enhancement&quot; data-align-center=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ce5617/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6341x4227+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fca-times.brightspotcdn.com%2F3c%2F50%2Fca4121a84a10b0c5343608b310db%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-464346-na-pol-environmental-hazards10-mw.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Bethany Slavic Missionary Church&quot; width=&quot;840&quot; height=&quot;560&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Figure-content&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stream next to Bethany Slavic Missionary Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Max Whittaker / For The Times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the well was tested again in March, the chemicals had climbed to 59 parts per trillion, according to a letter disclosing the results the Air Force sent to the church’s pastor, Adam Bondaruk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sample results” are “below the United States Environmental Protection Agency Lifetime Health Advisory level of 70 parts per trillion,” said the letter, a copy of which was provided by the church. “The Air Force is committed to protecting human health and the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the letter made no recommendations to limit use of the well for drinking water, the church initially took no action. When another sample was taken in June, it showed the contaminant level had dropped sharply — back to 16 parts per trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the church recently started taking precautions, after inquiries from The Times. Ciuriuc stopped taking water every Sunday. Highlands Community Charter School, which leases space from the church, began offering bottled water to its 44 adult students who attend class there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, church leaders padlocked the well.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Habits of Expert Software Designers</title>
<link>https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/habits-of-expert-software-designers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/habits-of-expert-software-designers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The best designers employ specific habits, learned practices, and observed principles when they work. Here are a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/final-desk-700x420.png&quot; class=&quot;attachment-large size-large wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;Experience and innate ability are not the only paths to success. Illustration: Yen Quach
&lt;p&gt;By: Marian Petre &amp;amp; André van der Hoek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;What makes an expert software designer? The typical answer — experience and innate ability — is less than satisfying. While it carries elements of truth, it offers little from which we can learn and generalize. Experts clearly do not just approach their work randomly. Quite the contrary, they have specific habits, learned practices, and observed principles that they employ deliberately during their design work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may be familiar with them, others not. Some are easily put in practice, others not. Some have immediate impact, others not. A constant, however, is that expert software designers are keenly aware of all of these practices and draw on them when the situation calls for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooted in many years of studying professional software designers and their ways of working, our book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Software-Design-Decoded-Experts-Think/dp/0262035189&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Software Design Decoded&lt;/a&gt;” illuminates 66 of those habits, practices, and principles, several of which are featured below. They have been confirmed to us time and again by those working in the field, and each can be traced back to academic literature that documents expert behavior. The book’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://softwaredesigndecoded.wordpress.com/annotated-bibliography/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;companion site&lt;/a&gt; provides an annotated bibliography that compiles that key underpinning literature, as well as the opportunity to suggest additional insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, software is no longer limited by technology, but rather by imagination. Yet the software that turns the imagined into reality can be complex, and the context in which this transformation must happen can be even more complex. This places extraordinary demands on software designers, demands that can be met only if we collectively “step up” to achieve sustained excellence in design. We hope these illustrations can play a small part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1) Experts involve the user:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-involve-the-user-final-1-700x495.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1291&quot;/&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/ACI/?author=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dog-appropriate switches&lt;/a&gt; designed by Clara&lt;br/&gt;Mancini.
&lt;p&gt;Experts are acutely aware of users. They deliberately involve users in the design process, studying them, talking to them, engaging them in testing intermediate designs, and even asking them to take an active role in the design team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet experts do not take everything users say at face value. They realize the potential limitations, as users’ thinking is often colored by current experiences. Experts look beyond what users ask for, to what users actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2) Experts design elegant abstractions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5-design-elegant-abstractions-final-test-700x348.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1293&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all developers create abstractions, experts design them. A good abstraction makes evident what is important, both in what it does and how it does it. Through a single lens, it communicates the problem it solves and the machinery of its solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts are not satisfied with just any abstraction, they deliberately seek elegant abstractions through which complex structures can be introduced, understood, and referred to efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3) Experts focus on the essence:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-focus-on-the-essence-final-copy-700x495.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1294&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every design problem has an essence, a core set of considerations that must be understood and “nailed” in the design solution for it to solve the problem successfully. This essence can be disruptive: changes in the core drastically alter the peripheral decisions that need to be made. Experts focus their efforts on the essence first, and delay expending effort designing on the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4) Experts simulate continually:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/simulate-700x495.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1298&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts imagine how a design will work — simulating aspects of the envisioned software and how the different parts of the design support a variety of scenarios. When working with others, experts regularly walk through a design by verbalizing its operation step-by-step. When alone, they simulate mentally, exercising the design repeatedly over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5) Experts look around:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-look-around-final-copy-700x495.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1295&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way that architects walk cities to examine and take inspiration from existing buildings, software experts examine the designs of other software to “see how they did it.” They frequently do so in response to a particular challenge they face, but they often also spend time looking around just to add to their repertoire of possible design solutions to draw upon in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6) Experts reshape the problem space:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-reshape-the-problem-space-final-1-700x401.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1302&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often step back from the stated problem and consider the problem space more broadly, looking for alternative ways of understanding “what the problem is.” They may change direction by reconceiving the problem space, or by addressing a different problem in the same space. They intentionally choose somewhat different goals from the original design problem, as this leads to insights either into where the real problem lies, or into how to overcome key obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7) Experts see error as opportunity:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3-see-error-as-opportunity-final-copy-700x495.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1297&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design regularly involves error: things that “go amiss,” misunderstandings, obstacles, wrong turns, emergent issues. Rather than fearing error, experts embrace error as opportunity. They accept it as an inherent part of design and take time to explore both the failure and the context around it. Understanding what happened often reveals insights about the problem — or about the solution — such as assumptions, misconceptions, misalignments, and emergent properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8) Experts think about what they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; designing:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/not-design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-1255&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is natural to focus on what a design must accomplish, experts also spend time thinking about what a design is not intended to do. In articulating and considering boundaries, they discover where they are over- and under-designing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scissor Statements: Sort by Controversial</title>
<link>https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Epistemic status: fiction]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for letting me put my story on your blog. Mainstream media is crap and no one would have believed me anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts in September 2017. I was working for a small online ad startup. You know the ads on Facebook and Twitter? We tell companies how to get them the most clicks. This startup – I won’t tell you the name – was going to add deep learning, because investors will throw money at anything that uses the words “deep learning”. We train a network to predict how many upvotes something will get on Reddit. Then we ask it how many likes different ads would get. Then we use whatever ad would get the most likes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://minimaxir.com/2017/06/reddit-deep-learning/&quot;&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; (who is not me) explains it better. Why Reddit? Because the upvotes and downvotes are simpler than all the different Facebook reacts, plus the subreddits allow demographic targeting, plus there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/&quot;&gt;an archive of 1.7 billion Reddit comments&lt;/a&gt; you can download for training data. We trained a network to predict upvotes of Reddit posts based on their titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any predictive network doubles as a generative network. If you teach a neural net to recognize dogs, you can run it in reverse to get dog pictures. If you train a network to predict Reddit upvotes, you can run it in reverse to generate titles it predicts will be highly upvoted. We tried this and it was pretty funny. I don’t remember the exact wording, but for /r/politics it was something like “Donald Trump is no longer the president. All transgender people are the president.” For r/technology it was about Elon Musk saving Net Neutrality. You can also generate titles that will get maximum downvotes, but this is boring: it will just say things that sound like spam about penis pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit has a feature where you can sort posts by controversial. You can see the algorithm &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/db/_sorts.pyx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but tl;dr it multiplies magnitude of total votes (upvotes + downvotes) by balance (upvote:downvote ratio or vice versa, whichever is smaller) to highlight posts that provoke disagreement. Controversy sells, so we trained our network to predict this too. The project went to this new-ish Indian woman with a long name who went by Shiri, and she couldn’t get it to work, so our boss Brad sent me to help. Shiri had tested the network on the big 1.7 billion comment archive, and it had produced controversial-sounding hypothethical scenarios about US politics. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese tested their bioweapons on Chinese prisoners. The Tuskegee Institute tested syphilis on African-Americans. We were either nicer or dumber than they were, because we tested Shiri’s Scissor on ourselves. We had a private internal subreddit where we discussed company business, because Brad wanted all of us to get familiar with the platform. Shiri’s problem was that she’d been testing the controversy-network on our subreddit, and it would just spit out vacuously true or vacuously false statements. No controversy, no room for disagreement. The statement we were looking at that day was about a design choice in our code. I won’t tell you the specifics, but imagine you took every bad and wrong decision decision in the world, hard-coded them in the ugliest possible way, and then handed it to the end user with a big middle finger. Shiri’s Scissor spit out, as maximally controversial, the statement that we should design our product that way. We’d spent ten minutes arguing about exactly where the bug was, when Shiri said something about how she didn’t understand why the program was generating obviously true statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiri’s English wasn’t great, so I thought this was a communication problem. I corrected her. The program was spitting out obviously false statements. She stuck to her guns. I still thought she was confused. I walked her through the meanings of the English words “true” and “false”. She looked offended. I tried to confirm. She thought this abysmal programming decision, this plan of combining every bad design technique together and making it impossible to ever fix, was the right way to build our codebase? She said it was. Worse, she was confused I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; think so. She thought this was more or less what we were already doing; it wasn’t. She thought that moving away from this would take a total rewrite and make the code much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was doubting my sanity, so we went next door to Blake and David, who were senior coders in our company and usually voices of reason. They were talking about their own problem, but I interrupted them and gave them the Scissor statement. Blake gave the reasonable response – why are you bothering me with this stupid wrong garbage? But David had the same confusion Shiri did and started arguing that the idea made total sense. The four of us started fighting. I still was sure Shiri and David just misunderstood the question, even though David was a native English-speaker and the question was crystal-clear. Meanwhile David was feeling more and more condescended to, kept protesting he wasn’t misunderstanding anything, that Blake and I were just crappy programmers who couldn’t make the most basic architecture decisions. He kept insisting the same thing Shiri had, that the Scissor statement had already been the plan and any attempt to go in a different direction would screw everything up. It got so bad that we decided to go to Brad for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad was our founder. Don’t trust the newspapers – not every tech entrepreneur is a greedy antisocial philistine. But everyone in advertising is. Brad definitely was. He was an abrasive amoral son of a bitch. But he was good at charming investors, and he could code, which is more than some bosses. He looked pissed to have the whole coding team come into his office unannounced, but he heard us out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David tried to explain the issue, but he misrepresented almost every part of it. I couldn’t believe he was lying just to look better to Brad. I cut him off. He told me not to interrupt him. Blake said if he wasn’t lying we wouldn’t have to interrupt to correct him, it degenerated from there. Somehow in the middle of all of this, Brad figured out what we were talking about and he cut us all off. “That’s the stupidest thing I ever heard.” He confirmed it wasn’t the original plan, it was contrary to the original plan, and it was contrary to every rule of good programming and good business. David and Shiri, who were bad losers, accused Blake and me of “poisoning” Brad. David said that of course Brad would side with us. Brad had liked us better from the beginning. We’d racked up cushy project after cushy project while he and Shiri had gotten the dregs. Brad told him he was a moron and should get back to work. He didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of the story ends at 8 PM with Brad firing David and Shiri for a combination of gross incompetence, gross insubordination, and being terrible human beings. With him giving a long speech on how he’d taken a chance on hiring David and Shiri, even though he knew from the beginning that they were unqualified charity cases, and at every turn they’d repaid his kindness with laziness and sabotage. With him calling them a drain on the company and implied they might be working for our competitors. With them calling him an abusive boss, saying the whole company was a scam to trick vulnerable employees into working themselves ragged for Brad’s personal enrichment, and with them accusing us two – me and Blake – of being in on it with Brad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was 8 PM. We’d been standing in Brad’s office fighting for five hours. At 8:01, after David and Shiri had stormed out, we all looked at each other and thought – holy shit, the controversial filter works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to repeat that. At no time in our five hours of arguing did this occur to us. We were too focused on the issue at hand, the Scissor statement itself. We didn’t have the perspective to step back and think about how all this controversy came from a statement designed to be maximally controversial. But at 8:01, when the argument was over and we had won, we stepped back and thought – holy shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were too tired to think much about it that evening, but the next day we – Brad and the two remaining members of the coding team – had a meeting. We talked about what we had. Blake gave it its name: Shiri’s Scissor. In some dead language, scissor shares a root with schism. A scissor is a schism-er, a schism-creator. And that was what we had. We were going to pivot from online advertising to superweapons. We would call the Pentagon. Tell them we had a program that could make people hate each other. Was this ethical? We were in online ads; we would sell our grandmothers to Somali slavers if we thought it would get us clicks. That horse had left the barn a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to just call up the Pentagon and tell them you have a superweapon. Even in Silicon Valley, they don’t believe you right away. But Brad called in favors from his friends, and about a week after David and Shiri got fired, we had a colonel from DARPA standing in the meeting room, asking what the hell we thought was so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we had a problem. We couldn’t show the Colonel the Scissor statement that had gotten Dave and Shiri fired. He wasn’t in our company; he wasn’t even in ad tech; it would seem boring to him. We didn’t want to generate a new Scissor statement for the Pentagon. Even Brad could figure out that having the US military descend into civil war would be bad for clicks. Finally we settled on a plan. We explained the concept of Reddit to the Colonel. And then we asked him which community he wanted us to tear apart as a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought for a second, then said “Mozambique”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had underestimated the culture gap here. When we asked the Colonel to choose a community to be a Scissor victim, we were expecting “tabletop wargamers” or “My Little Pony fans”. But this was not how colonels at DARPA thought about the world. He said “Mozambique”. I started explaining to him that this wasn’t really how Reddit worked, it needed to be a group with its own subreddit. Brad interrupted me, said that Mozambique &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Mozambique/&quot;&gt;had a subreddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see the wheels turning in Brad’s eyes. One wheel was saying “this guy is already skeptical, if we look weak in front of him he’ll just write us off completely”. The other wheel was calculating how many clicks Mozambique produced. Mene mene tekel upharsin. “Yeah,” he said. “Their subreddit is fine. We can do Mozambique.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colonel gave us his business card and left. Blake and I were stuck running Shiri’s Scissor on the Mozambique subreddit. I know, ethics, but like I said, online ads business, horse, barn door. The only decency we allowed ourselves was to choose the network’s tenth pick – we didn’t need to destroy everything, just give a demonstration. We got a statement accusing the Prime Minister of disrespecting Islam in a certain way – again, I won’t be specific. In the absence of any better method, we PMed the admins of the Mozambique subreddit asking them what they thought. I don’t remember what we said, something about being an American political science student learning about Mozambique culture, and could they ask some friends what would happen if the Prime Minister did that specific thing, and then report back to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of a week working on our project to undermine Mozambique. Then we got the news. David and Shiri were suing the company for unfair dismissal and racial discrimination. Brad and Blake and I were white. Shiri was an Indian woman, and David was Jewish. The case should have been laughed out of court – who ever heard of an anti-Semitic Silicon Valley startup? – except that all the documentation showed there was no reason to fire David and Shiri. Their work looked good on paper. They’d always gotten good performance reviews. The company was doing fine – it had even placed ads for more programmers a few weeks before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David and Shiri knew why they’d been fired. But it didn’t matter to them. They were so blinded with hatred for our company, so caught in the grip of the Scissor statement, that they would tell any lie necessary to destroy it. We were caught in a bind. We couldn’t admit the existence of Shiri’s Scissor, because we were trying to sell it to the Pentagon as a secret weapon, and also, publicly admitting to trying to destroy Mozambique would have been bad PR. But the court was demanding records about what our company had been doing just before and just after the dismissal. A real defense contractor could probably have gotten the Pentagon to write a letter saying our research was classified. But the Pentagon still didn’t believe us. The Colonel was humoring us, nothing more. We were stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how we would have dealt with the legal problems, because what actually happened was Brad went to David’s house and tried to beat him up. You’re going to think this was crazy, but you have to understand that David had always been annoying to work with, and that during the argument in Brad’s office he had crossed so many lines that, if ever there was a person who deserved physical violence, it was him. Suing the company was just the last straw. I’m not going to judge Brad’s actions after he’d spent months cleaning up after David’s messes, paying him good money, and then David betrayed him at the end. But anyhow, that was it for our company. Brad got arrested. There was nobody else to pay the bills and keep the lights on. Blake and I were coders and had no idea how to run the business side of things. We handed in our resignations – not literally, Brad was in jail – and that was the end of Name Withheld Online Ad Company, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got off easy. That’s the takeaway I want to give here. We were unreasonably overwhelmingly lucky. If Shiri and I had started out by arguing about one of the US statements, we could have destroyed the country. If a giant like Google had developed Shiri’s Scissor, it would have destroyed Google. If the Scissor statement we generated hadn’t just been about a very specific piece of advertising software – if it had been about the tech industry in general, or business in general – we could have destroyed the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it was, we just destroyed our company and maybe a few of our closest competitors. If you look up internal publications from the online advertising industry around fall 2017, you will find some really weird stuff. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-jaffer-arrest-20171022-story.html&quot;&gt;That story about&lt;/a&gt; the online ads CEO getting arrested for murder, child abuse, attacking a cop, and three or four other things, and then later it was all found to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/tech-child-rape-vungle-zain-jaffer/&quot;&gt;false accusations&lt;/a&gt; related to some ill-explained mental disorder – that’s the tip of the iceberg. I don’t have a good explanation for exactly how the Scissor statement spread or why it didn’t spread further, but I bet if I looked into it too much, black helicopters would start hovering over my house. And that’s all I’m going to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I quit the whole industry. I picked up a job in a more established company using ML for voice recognition, and tried not to think about it too much. I still got angry whenever I thought about the software design issue the Scissor had brought up. Once I saw someone who looked like Shiri at a cafe and I went over intending to give her a piece of my mind. It wasn’t her, so I didn’t end up in jail with Brad. I checked the news from Mozambique every so often, and it was quiet for a few months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mg.co.za/article/2018-06-22-00-mozambiques-mysterious-insurgency&quot;&gt;and then it wasn’t&lt;/a&gt;. I still don’t know if we had anything to do with that. Africa just has a lot of conflicts, and if you wait long enough, maybe something will happen. The colonel never tried to get in touch with me. I don’t think he ever took us seriously. Maybe he didn’t even check the news from Mozambique. Maybe he saw it and figured it was a coincidence. Maybe he tried calling our company, got a message saying the phone was out of service, and didn’t think it was worth pursuing. But as time went on and the conflict there didn’t get any worse, I hoped the Shiri’s Scissor part of my life was drawing to a close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the Kavanaugh hearings. Something about them gave me a sense of deja vu. The week of his testimony, I figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiri had told me that when she ran the Scissor on the site in general, she’d just gotten some appropriate controversial US politics scenarios. She had shown me two or three of them as examples. One of them had been very specifically about this situation. A Republican Supreme Court nominee accused of committing sexual assault as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me freak out. Had somebody gotten hold of the Scissor and started using it on the US? Had that Pentagon colonel been paying more attention than he let on? But why would the Pentagon be trying to divide America? Had some enemy stolen it? I get the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, obviously Putin was my first thought here. But how would Putin get Shiri’s Scissor? Was I remembering wrong? I couldn’t get it out of my head. I hadn’t kept the list Shiri had given me, but I had enough of the Scissor codebase to rebuild the program over a few sleepless nights. Then I bought a big blob of compute from Amazon Web Services and threw it at the Reddit comment archive. It took three days and a five-digit sum of money, but I rebuilt the list Shiri must have had. Kavanaugh was in there, just as I remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But so was Colin Kaepernick&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard of him. He was the football player who refused to stand for the national anthem. If I already knew the Scissor predicted one controversy, why was I so shocked to learn it predicted another? Because Kaepernick started kneeling in 2016. We didn’t build the Scissor until 2017. Putin hadn’t gotten it from us. Someone had beaten us to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the Scissor’s predicted top hundred most controversial statements, Kavanaugh was #58 and Kaepernick was #42. #86 was the Ground Zero Mosque. #89 was that baker who wouldn’t make a cake for a gay wedding. The match isn’t perfect, but #99 vaguely looked like the Elian Gonzalez case from 2000. That’s five out of a hundred. Is that what would happen by chance? It’s a big country, and lots of things happen here, and if a Scissor statement came up in the normal course of events it would get magnified to the national stage. But some of these were too specific. If it was coincidence, I would expect many more near matches than perfect matches. I found only two. The pattern of Scissor statements looked more like someone had arranged them to be perfect fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest perfect fit was the Ground Zero Mosque in 2009. Could Putin have had a Scissor-like program in 2009? I say no way. This will sound weird to you if you’re not in the industry. Why couldn’t a national government have been eight years ahead of an online advertising company? All I can say is: machine learning moves faster than that. Russia couldn’t hide a machine learning program that put it eight years ahead of the US. Even the Pentagon couldn’t hide a program that put it eight years ahead of industry. The NSA is thirty years ahead of industry in cryptography and everyone knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then who was generating Scissor statements in 2009? I have no idea. And you know what? I can’t bring myself to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just read a Scissor statement off a list, it’s harmless. It just seems like a trivially true or trivially false thing. It doesn’t activate until you start discussing it with somebody. At first you just think they’re an imbecile. Then they call you an imbecile, and you want to defend yourself. Crescit eundo. You notice all the little ways they’re lying to you and themselves and their audience every time they open their mouth to defend their imbecilic opinion. Then you notice how all the lies are connected, that in order to keep getting the little things like the Scissor statement wrong, they have to drag in everything else. Eventually even that doesn’t work, they’ve just got to make everybody hate you so that nobody will even listen to your argument no matter how obviously true it is. Finally, they don’t care about the Scissor statement anymore. They’ve just dug themselves so deep basing their whole existence around hating you and wanting you to fail that they can’t walk it back. You’ve got to prove them wrong, not because you care about the Scissor statement either, but because otherwise they’ll do anything to poison people against you, make it impossible for them to even understand the argument for why you deserve to exist. You know this is true. Your mind becomes a constant loop of arguments you can use to defend yourself, and rehearsals of arguments for why their attacks are cruel and unfair, and the one burning question: how can you thwart them? How can you convince people not to listen to them, before they find those people and exploit their biases and turn them against you? How can you combat the superficial arguments they’re deploying, before otherwise good people get convinced, so convinced their mind will be made up and they can never be unconvinced again? &lt;em&gt;How can you keep yourself safe?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiri read two or three sample Scissor statements to me. She didn’t say if she agreed with them or not. I didn’t tell her if I agreed with them or not. They were harmless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t hear voices in a crazy way. But sometimes I talk to myself. Sometimes I do both halves of the conversation. Sometimes I imagine one of them is a different person. I had a tough breakup a year ago. Sometimes the other voice in my head is my ex-girlfriend’s voice. I know how she thinks and I always know what she would say about everything. So sometimes I hold conversations with her, even though she isn’t there, and we’ve barely talked since the breakup. I don’t know if this is weird. If it is, I’m weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was enough. For some reason, it was the third-highest-ranked Scissor statement that did it. None of the others, just that one. The totally hypothetical conversation with the version of my ex-girlfriend in my head about the third Scissor statement got me. Shiri’s Scissor was never really about other people anyway. Other people are just the trigger – and I use that word deliberately, in the trigger warning sense. Once you’re triggered, you never need to talk to anyone else again. Just the knowledge that those people are out there is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d be done with this story in a night. Instead it’s taken me two weeks, all the way up until Halloween – perfect night for a ghost story, right? I’ve been alternately drinking and smoking weed, trying to calm myself down enough to think about anything other than the third Scissor statement. No, that’s not right, definitely trying not to think about either of the first two Scissor statements, because if I think about them, I might start thinking about how some people disagree with them, and then I’m gone. Three times I’ve started to call my ex-girlfriend to ask her where she is, and if I ever go through with it and she answers me, I don’t know what I will do to her. But it isn’t just her. Fifty percent of the population disagrees with me on the third-highest-ranked Scissor statement. I don’t know who they are. I haven’t really appreciated that fact. Not really. I can’t imagine it being anyone I know. They’re too decent. But I can’t be sure it isn’t. So I drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I should be talking about how we all need to unite against whatever shadowy manipulators keep throwing Scissor statements at us. I want to talk about how we need to cultivate radical compassion and charity as the only defense against such abominations. I want to give an Obamaesque speech about how the ties that bring us together are stronger than the forces tearing us apart. But I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember what we did to Mozambique? How out of some vestigial sense of ethics, we released a low-potency Scissor statement? Arranged to give them a bad time without destroying the whole country all at once? That’s what our shadowy manipulators are doing to us. Low-potency statements. Enough to get us enraged. Not enough to start Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I read the whole list. And then, like an idiot, I thought about it. I thought about the third-highest-ranked Scissor statement in enough detail to let it trigger. To even begin to question whether it might be true is so sick, so perverse, so hateful and disgusting, that Idi Amin would flush with shame to even contemplate it. And if the Scissor’s right then half of you would be gung ho in support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You guys, who haven’t heard a really bad Scissor statement yet and don’t know what it’s like – it’s easy for you to say “don’t let it manipulate you” or “we need a hard and fast policy of not letting ourselves fight over Scissor statements”. But how do you know you’re not in the wrong? How do you know there’s not an issue out there where, if you knew it, you would agree it would be better to just nuke the world and let us start over again from the sewer mutants, rather than let the sort of people who would support it continue to pollute the world with their presence? How do you know that you’re not like the schoolkid who superciliously says “&lt;em&gt;Nothing&lt;/em&gt; is bad enough to deserve a swear word” when the worst that’s ever happened to her is dropping her lollipop in the dirt. If that schoolkid gets kidnapped and tortured, does she change her mind? If she can’t describe the torture to her schoolmates, but just says “a really bad thing happened to me”, and they still insist nothing could be bad enough to justify using swear words, who do you side with? Then why are you still thinking I’m “damaged” when I tell you I’ve seen the Scissor statement, and charity and compassion and unity can fuck off and die? Some last remnant of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/30/book-review-inadequate-equilibria/&quot;&gt;outside-view morality&lt;/a&gt; keeps me from writing the whole list here and letting you all exterminate yourselves. Some remnant of how I would have thought about these things a month ago holds me back. So listen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete Facebook. Delete Twitter. Throw away your cell phone. Unsubscribe from the newspaper. Tell your friends and relatives not to discuss politics or society. If they slip up, break off all contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, buy canned food. Stockpile water. Learn to shoot a gun. If you can afford a bunker, get a bunker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because one day, whoever keeps feeding us Scissor statements is going to release one of the bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;
