<title>Things to use in Python 3</title>
<link>https://datawhatnow.com/things-you-are-probably-not-using-in-python-3-but-should/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://datawhatnow.com/things-you-are-probably-not-using-in-python-3-but-should/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Many people started switching their Python versions from 2 to 3 as a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pythonclock.org/&quot;&gt;Python EOL&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, most Python 3 I find still looks like Python 2, but with parentheses (even I am guilty of that in my code examples in previous posts – &lt;a href=&quot;https://datawhatnow.com/introduction-web-scraping-python/&quot;&gt;Introduction to web scraping with Python&lt;/a&gt;). Below, I show some examples of exciting features you can only use in Python 3 in the hopes that it will make solving your problems with Python easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the examples are written in Python 3.7 and each feature contains the minimum required version of Python for that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;f-strings (3.6+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to do anything without strings in any programming language and in order to stay sane, you want to have a structured way to work with strings. Most people using Python prefer using the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
user = &quot;Jane Doe&quot;
action = &quot;buy&quot;

log_message = 'User {} has logged in and did an action {}.'.format(
  user,
  action
)

print(log_message)
# User Jane Doe has logged in and did an action buy.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside of &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;, Python 3 offers a flexible way to do string interpolation via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/&quot;&gt;f-strings&lt;/a&gt;. The same code as above using f-strings looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
user = &quot;Jane Doe&quot;
action = &quot;buy&quot;

log_message = f'User {user} has logged in and did an action {action}.'
print(log_message)
# User Jane Doe has logged in and did an action buy.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pathlib (3.4+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f-strings are amazing, but some strings like file paths have their own libraries which make their manipulation even easier. Python 3 offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html&quot;&gt;pathlib&lt;/a&gt; as a convenient abstraction for working with file paths. If you are not sure why you should be using pathlib, try reading this excellent post – &lt;a href=&quot;https://treyhunner.com/2018/12/why-you-should-be-using-pathlib/&quot;&gt;Why you should be using pathlib&lt;/a&gt; – by &lt;a href=&quot;https://treyhunner.com/&quot;&gt;Trey Hunner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
from pathlib import Path

root = Path('post_sub_folder')
print(root)
# post_sub_folder

path = root / 'happy_user'

# Make the path absolute
print(path.resolve())
# /home/weenkus/Workspace/Projects/DataWhatNow-Codes/how_your_python3_should_look_like/post_sub_folder/happy_user
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Type hinting (3.5+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static vs dynamic typing is a spicy topic in software engineering and almost everyone has an opinion on it. I will let the reader decide when they should write types, but I think you should at least know that Python 3 supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html&quot;&gt;type hints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
def sentence_has_animal(sentence: str) -&amp;gt; bool:
  return &quot;animal&quot; in sentence

sentence_has_animal(&quot;Donald had a farm without animals&quot;)
# True
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enumerations (3.4+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3 supports an easy way to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum&quot;&gt;enumerations&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt; class. Enums are a convenient way to encapsulate lists of constants so they are not randomly located all over your code without much structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
from enum import Enum, auto

class Monster(Enum):
    ZOMBIE = auto()
    WARRIOR = auto()
    BEAR = auto()
    
print(Monster.ZOMBIE)
# Monster.ZOMBIE
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote is-style-default&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enumeration is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant values. Within an enumeration, the members can be compared by identity, and the enumeration itself can be iterated over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
for monster in Monster:
    print(monster)

# Monster.ZOMBIE
# Monster.WARRIOR
# Monster.BEAR
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Built-in LRU cache (3.2+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caches are present in almost any horizontal slice of the software and hardware we use today. Python 3 makes using them very simple by exposing an LRU (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)&quot;&gt;Least Recently Used&lt;/a&gt;) cache as a decorator called &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache&quot;&gt;lru_cache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a simple Fibonacci function that we know will benefit from caching because it does the same work multiple times through a recursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
import time

def fib(number: int) -&amp;gt; int:
    if number == 0: return 0
    if number == 1: return 1
    
    return fib(number-1) + fib(number-2)

start = time.time()
fib(40)
print(f'Duration: {time.time() - start}s')
# Duration: 30.684099674224854s
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can use the &lt;code&gt;lru_cache&lt;/code&gt; to optimize it (this optimization technique is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization&quot;&gt;memoization&lt;/a&gt;). The execution time goes down from seconds to nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=512)
def fib_memoization(number: int) -&amp;gt; int:
    if number == 0: return 0
    if number == 1: return 1
    
    return fib_memoization(number-1) + fib_memoization(number-2)

start = time.time()
fib_memoization(40)
print(f'Duration: {time.time() - start}s')
# Duration: 6.866455078125e-05s
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extended iterable unpacking (3.0+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will let the code speak here (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
head, *body, tail = range(5)
print(head, body, tail)
# 0 [1, 2, 3] 4

py, filename, *cmds = &quot;python3.7 script.py -n 5 -l 15&quot;.split()
print(py)
print(filename)
print(cmds)
# python3.7
# script.py
# ['-n', '5', '-l', '15']

first, _, third, *_ = range(10)
print(first, third)
# 0 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data classes (3.7+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3 introduces &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html&quot;&gt;data classes&lt;/a&gt; which do not have many restrictions and can be used to reduce boilerplate code because the decorator auto-generates special methods, such as &lt;code&gt;__init__()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__repr()__&lt;/code&gt;. From the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;, they are described as “mutable named tuples with defaults”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Armor:
    
    def __init__(self, armor: float, description: str, level: int = 1):
        self.armor = armor
        self.level = level
        self.description = description
                 
    def power(self) -&amp;gt; float:
        return self.armor * self.level
    
armor = Armor(5.2, &quot;Common armor.&quot;, 2)
armor.power()
# 10.4

print(armor)
# &amp;lt;__main__.Armor object at 0x7fc4800e2cf8&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same implementation of Armor using data classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Armor:
    armor: float
    description: str
    level: int = 1
    

    def power(self) -&amp;gt; float:
        return self.armor * self.level
    
armor = Armor(5.2, &quot;Common armor.&quot;, 2)
armor.power()
# 10.4

print(armor)
# Armor(armor=5.2, description='Common armor.', level=2)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implicit namespace packages (3.3+)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to structure Python code is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages&quot;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt; (folders with an &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file). The example below is given by the official Python documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;generic&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
sound/                          Top-level package
      __init__.py               Initialize the sound package
      formats/                  Subpackage for file format conversions
              __init__.py
              wavread.py
              wavwrite.py
              aiffread.py
              aiffwrite.py
              auread.py
              auwrite.py
              ...
      effects/                  Subpackage for sound effects
              __init__.py
              echo.py
              surround.py
              reverse.py
              ...
      filters/                  Subpackage for filters
              __init__.py
              equalizer.py
              vocoder.py
              karaoke.py
              ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python 2, every folder above had to have an &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; file which turned that folder into a Python package. In Python 3, with the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/&quot;&gt;Implicit Namespace Packages&lt;/a&gt;, these files are no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;generic&quot; data-enlighter-theme=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-highlight=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-linenumbers=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-lineoffset=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-title=&quot;&quot; data-enlighter-group=&quot;&quot;&gt;
sound/                          Top-level package
      __init__.py               Initialize the sound package
      formats/                  Subpackage for file format conversions
              wavread.py
              wavwrite.py
              aiffread.py
              aiffwrite.py
              auread.py
              auwrite.py
              ...
      effects/                  Subpackage for sound effects
              echo.py
              surround.py
              reverse.py
              ...
      filters/                  Subpackage for filters
              equalizer.py
              vocoder.py
              karaoke.py
              ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: as some people have said, this is not as simple as I pointed it out in this section, from the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/#specification&quot;&gt;PEP 420 Specification&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;code&gt;__init__.py&lt;/code&gt; is still required for regular packages, dropping it from the folder structure will turn it into a native namespace package which comes with additional restrictions, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages&quot;&gt;official docs on native namespace packages&lt;/a&gt; show a great example of this, as well as naming all the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like almost any list on the internet, this one is not complete. I hope this post has shown you at least one Python 3 functionality you did not know existed before, and that it will help you write cleaner and more intuitive code. As always, all the code can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Weenkus/DataWhatNow-Codes/blob/master/things_you_are_probably_not_using_in_python_3_but_should/python%203%20examples.ipynb&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>John Carmack on QuakeWorld latency and business model (1996)</title>
<link>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive/master/by_day/johnc_plan_19960802.txt</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive/master/by_day/johnc_plan_19960802.txt</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;121&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is The New Plan: I copied off the quake codebase and set about doing some major improvements. The old v1.01 codebase will still be updated to fix bugs with the current version, but I didn't want to hold back from fixing things properly even if it involves some major changes. I am focusing on the internet play aspect of the game. While I can lay out a grand clean-sheet-of-paper design, I have chosen to pursue something of a limited enough scope that I can expect to start testing it around the end of the month (august). I still have my grand plans for the future, but I want to get some stuff going NOW. QuakeWorld. The code I am developing right now is EXCLUSIVELY for internet play. It will be rolled back into the single player game sometime along the road to Quake 2 (or whatever it turns out to be called), but the experimental QuakeWorld release will consist of seperate programs for the client and the server. They will use the same data as the current registered quake, so the only thing that will be distributed is new executables (they will peacefully coexist with current quake). There will be a single master server running here at id. Whenever anyone starts up a server, it will register itself with the master server, and whenever a client wants to start a game, it will inquire with the master to find out which servers are available. Users will have a persistant account, and all frags on the entire internet will be logged. I want us to be able to give a global ranking order of everyone playing the game. You should be able to say, &quot;I am one of the ten best QuakeWorld players in existance&quot;, and have the record to back it up. There are all sorts of other cool stats that we could mine out of the data: greatest frags/minute, longest uninterrupted quake game, cruelest to newbies, etc, etc. For the time being, this is just my pet research project. The new exes will only work with registered Quake, so I can justify it as a registration incentive (don't pirate!). If it looks feasable, I would like to see internet focused gaming become a justifiable biz direction for us. Its definately cool, but it is uncertain if people can actually make money at it. My halfway thought out proposal for a biz plan is that we let anyone play the game as an anonymous newbie to see if they like it, but to get their name registered and get on the ranking list, they need to pay $10 or so. Newbies would be automatically kicked from servers if a paying customer wants to get on. Sound reasonable? Technical improvements. The game physics is being reworked to make it faster and more uniform. Currently, a p90 dedicated server is about 50% loaded with eight players. The new network code causes a higher cpu load, so I am trying to at least overbalance that, and maybe make a little headway. A single p6-200 system should be able to run around ten simultanious eight player servers. Multiple servers running on a single machine will work a lot better with the master server automatically dealing with different port adresses behind the client's back. A couple subtle features are actually going away. The automatic view tilting on slopes and stairs is buggy in v1.01, and over a couple hundred millisecond latancy connection, it doesn't usually start tilting until you are allready on a different surface, so I just ripped it out entirely. A few other non-crucial game behaviors are also being cut in the interest of making the physics easier to match on the client side. I'm going to do a good chat mode. Servers will have good access control lists. If somebody manages to piss off the entire community, we could even ban them at the master server. The big difference is in the net code. While I can remember and justify all of my decisions about networking from DOOM through Quake, the bottom line is that I was working with the wrong basic assumptions for doing a good internet game. My original design was targeted at &amp;lt;200ms connection latencies. People that have a digital connection to the internet through a good provider get a pretty good game experience. Unfortunately, 99% of the world gets on with a slip or ppp connection over a modem, often through a crappy overcrowded ISP. This gives 300+ ms latencies, minimum. Client. User's modem. ISP's modem. Server. ISP's modem. User's modem. Client. God, that sucks. Ok, I made a bad call. I have a T1 to my house, so I just wasn't familliar with PPP life. I'm adressing it now. The first move was to scrap the current net code. It was based on a reliable stream as its original primitive (way back in qtest), then was retrofited to have an unreliable sideband to make internet play feasable. It was a big mess, so I took it out and shot it. The new code has the unreliable packet as its basic primitive, and all the complexities that entails is now visible to the main code instead of hidden under the net api. This is A Good Thing. Goodbye phantom unconnected players, messages not getting through, etc. The next move was a straightforward attack on latency. The communications channel is not the only thing that contributes to a latent response, and there was some good ground to improve on. In a perfect environment, the instant you provided any input (pressed a key, moved a mouse, etc) you would have feedback on the screen (or speaker) from the action. In the real world, even single player games have latency. A typical game loop goes something like: Read user input. Simulate the world. Render a new graphics scene. Repeat. If the game is running 15 frames a second, that is 66 ms each frame. The user input will arive at a random point in the frame, so it will be an average of 33 ms before the input is even looked at. The input is then read, and 66 more ms pass before the result is actually displayed to the user, for a total of nearly 100 ms of latency, right on your desktop. (you can even count another 8 ms or so for raster refresh if you want to get picky). The best way to adress that latency is to just make the game run faster if possible. If the screen was sized down so that the game ran 25 fps, the latency would be down to 60ms. There are a few other things that can be done to shave a bit more off, like short circuiting some late braeking information (like view angles) directly into the refresh stage, bypassing the simulation stage. The bearing that this all has on net play, aside from setting an upper limit on performance, is that the current Quake servers have a similar frame cycle. They had to, to provide -listen server support. Even when you run a dedicated server, the model is still: fetch all input, process the world, send updates out to all clients. The default server framerate is 20 fps (50 ms). You can change this by adjusting the sys_ticrate cvar, but there are problems either way. If you ask for more fps from the server, you may get less latency, but you would almost certainly overcommit the bandwidth of a dialup link, resulting in all sorts of unwanted buffering in the routers and huge multi thousand ms latency times as things unclog (if they ever do). The proper way to address this is by changing the server model from a game style loop to a fileserver/database style loop. Instead of expecting everyone's messages to be dealt with at once, I now deal with each packet as it comes in. That player alone is moved forward in time, and a custom response is sent out in very short order. The rest of the objects in the world are spread out between the incoming packets. There are a lot of issues that that brings up. Time is no longer advancing uniformly for all objects in the world, which can cause a lot of problems. It works, though! The average time from a packet ariving at the system to the time a response is sent back is down to under 4ms, as opposed to over 50 with the old dedicated servers. Another side benefit is that the server never blindly sends packets out into the void, they must be specifically asked for (note that this is NOT a strict request/reply, because the client is streaming request without waiting for the replies). I am going to be adding bandwidth estimation to help out modem links. If quake knows that a link is clogged up, it can choose not to send anything else, which is far, far better than letting the network buffer everything up or randomly drop packets. A dialup line can just say &quot;never send more than 2000 bytes a second in datagrams&quot;, and while the update rate may drop in an overcommited situation, the latency will never pile up like it can with the current version of quake. The biggest difference is the addition of client side movement simulation. I am now allowing the client to guess at the results of the users movement until the authoritative response from the server comes through. This is a biiiig architectural change. The client now needs to know about solidity of objects, friction, gravity, etc. I am sad to see the elegent client-as-terminal setup go away, but I am practical above idealistic. The server is still the final word, so the client is allways repredicting it's movement based off of the last known good message from the server. There are still a lot of things I need to work out, but the basic results are as hoped for: even playing over a 200+ ms latency link, the player movement feels exactly like you are playing a single player game (under the right circumstances -- you can also get it to act rather weird at the moment). The latency isn't gone, though. The client doesn't simulate other objects in the world, so you apear to run a lot closer to doors before they open, and most noticably, projectiles from your weapons seem to come out from where you were, instead of where you are, if you are strafing sideways while you shoot. An interesting issue to watch when this gets out is that you won't be able to tell how long the latency to the server is based on your movement, but you will need to lead your opponents differently when shooting at them. In a clean sheet of paper redesign, I would try to correct more of the discrepencies, but I think I am going to have a big enough improvement coming out of my current work to make a lot of people very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber Drivers Are Contractors, Not Employees, Labor Board Says</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/economy/nlrb-uber-drivers-contractors.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The National Labor Relations Board, handing an important victory to Uber, has concluded that the company’s drivers are contractors, not employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The move, outlined by the board’s general counsel in a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nlrb.gov/case/13-CA-163062&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;memorandum&lt;/a&gt; released Tuesday, deals a blow to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/technology/uber-strike.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;drivers’ efforts&lt;/a&gt; to band together to demand higher pay and better working conditions from Uber and its main rival in the ride-hailing business, Lyft. It is the first major policy move the board has made concerning the so-called gig economy under President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Contractors lack the protection given to employees under federal law — and enforced by the labor board — for unionizing and other collective activity, such as protesting the policies of employers. As a practical matter, the conclusion makes it extremely difficult for Uber drivers to form a union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The board’s general counsel, Peter B. Robb, who was &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/business/economy/labor-board.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;appointed by Mr. Trump&lt;/a&gt;, does not have purview over other laws applying to employees, such as minimum wage and overtime protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Still, had Mr. Robb’s office found that drivers were employees rather than contractors, the decision could have put pressure on the regulators who enforce such laws to reach the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The labor costs of companies like Uber and Lyft would probably rise 20 to 30 percent, according to industry estimates, if regulators or courts forced them to treat drivers as employees. Both businesses have seen their stock prices fall after recent public offerings amid questions about their financial prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The companies appear to be walking a delicate line: Investors and analysts have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kateconger/status/1112846360548540416&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the businesses might have to slash their labor costs to become profitable. Drivers &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/technology/uber-strike.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;frequently complain&lt;/a&gt; that pay is already unacceptably low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Uber &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/business/dealbook/uber-vs-lyft-ipo-financials.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;lost nearly $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; last year, and Lyft lost nearly $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We are focused on improving the quality and security of independent work, while preserving the flexibility drivers and couriers tell us they value,” Uber said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The memo follows an opinion &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/business/economy/gig-economy-workers-contractors.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; by the Labor Department arguing that workers at an unnamed company with a business model like Uber’s were contractors, not employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In both cases, the conclusions reversed the approach adopted by the Obama administration, which had suggested that people who found work through apps were likely to be considered employees. In 2016, the labor board &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/business/state-rules-2-former-uber-drivers-eligible-for-jobless-payments.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;issued a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Postmates, an app-based delivery service, over allegations that the company had interfered with workers’ ability to exercise their labor rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The agency could not have issued that complaint without first concluding that Postmates couriers were employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The memo released on Tuesday, which was dated April 16, has no long-term value as a precedent and can be reversed by a future general counsel. But it carries considerable weight in how the board enforces federal labor law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The general counsel is the labor board’s chief prosecutor and has authority over whether or not to issue formal complaints against employers, which are analogous to indictments in criminal law. The memo essentially tells Uber drivers and many other gig-economy workers that they should not bother reporting a labor rights abuse to the board because Mr. Robb has deemed them to be outside its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Robb has had a long career in labor law largely spent representing employers. He was involved in the Reagan administration’s legal fight with the air traffic controllers’ union, which went on strike illegally in 1981. Labor experts have said the government’s decision to fire the controllers contributed to organized labor’s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The immediate consequence of the memo is to render moot three formal accusations, filed in different parts of the country, that Uber had violated federal labor law. The memo instructs the board’s regional offices to dismiss the charges if the people who made them do not withdraw them first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;In its analysis, the general counsel’s office listed 10 factors that collectively determine whether a worker is an employee or a contractor, including the extent to which the company can control how the work is performed and whether the company or the worker provides equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But, citing a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/fedex-home-delivery-v-nlrb&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;federal appeals court decision&lt;/a&gt;, the memo also said the “animating principle” used to make the determination of contractor status was whether the worker had an opportunity to profit from the activity in the way an entrepreneur would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The drivers had significant entrepreneurial opportunity by virtue of their near complete control of their cars and work schedules, together with freedom to choose login locations and to work for competitors of Uber,” the memo stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Marshall Babson, a former labor board member appointed by President Ronald Reagan who is now a labor lawyer representing management, said the general counsel’s conclusion had largely been dictated by the limitations of federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;While the conclusion may not be satisfying to those who believe the National Labor Relations Act, enacted in 1935, does not reflect the realities of today’s workplace, Mr. Babson said the board did not have the authority to expand the boundaries of the act on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Congress has to do it, not the N.L.R.B.,” Mr. Babson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But Wilma Liebman, a board chairwoman under President Barack Obama, said the memo elevated the importance of factors that indicate a contractor relationship, like whether both the company and worker believe the person is a contractor, and underplayed factors that suggest employment, like the fact that drivers perform a function that is central to Uber’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Ms. Liebman added that the memo took an extremely permissive view of entrepreneurship, given that drivers cannot set prices or market their personal services to potential customers. The driver’s entrepreneurial opportunities are almost “completely circumscribed by the company’s control of the price,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Some labor groups insisted that drivers would not be deterred from mobilizing for better treatment, even without the protections of federal labor law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Drivers across the globe are organizing and demanding rights,” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said in response to the memo. “The road may be long and difficult, but one way or another Uber will have to answer to its workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Boeing Resisted Pilots’ Calls for Aggressive Steps on 737 Max</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-plane-crash.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-plane-crash.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Weeks after the first fatal crash of the 737 Max, pilots from American Airlines pressed Boeing executives to work urgently on a fix. In a closed-door meeting, they even argued that Boeing should push authorities to take an emergency measure that would likely result in the grounding of the Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Boeing executives resisted. They didn’t want to rush out a fix, and said they expected pilots to be able to handle problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mike Sinnett, a vice president at Boeing, acknowledged that the manufacturer was assessing potential design flaws with the plane, including &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/world/asia/lion-air-plane-crash-pilots.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;new anti-stall software&lt;/a&gt;. But he balked at taking a more aggressive approach, saying it was not yet clear that the new system was to blame for the Lion Air crash, which killed 189 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“No one has yet to conclude that the sole cause of this was this function on the airplane,” Mr. Sinnett said, according to a recording of the Nov. 27 meeting reviewed by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Less than four months later, an Ethiopian Airlines flight &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/business/boeing-737-ethiopian-airlines.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;crashed&lt;/a&gt;, killing all 157 people on board. The flawed anti-stall system played a role in both disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing is facing intense scrutiny for the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;design and certification&lt;/a&gt; of the Max, as well as for its response to the two crashes. There are multiple investigations into the development of the Max. And in recent days, unions representing pilots from American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have received federal grand jury subpoenas for any documents related to Boeing’s communications about the jet, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration is also under fire for its role in approving the Max, and its decision to wait for days after the second crash to ground the plane. At a Wednesday congressional hearing, lawmakers will grill federal regulators about how the Max was certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Boeing declined to comment on the November meeting. “We are focused on working with pilots, airlines and global regulators to certify the updates on the Max and provide additional training and education to safely return the planes to flight,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;American Airlines said in a statement that it was “confident that the impending software updates, along with the new training elements Boeing is developing for the Max, will lead to recertification of the aircraft soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;Mike Sinnett, a Boeing vice president, balked at taking a more aggressive approach to issues with the 737 Max during a meeting with American Airlines pilots in November.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ted S. Warren/Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The hourlong November meeting, inside a windowless conference room at the Fort Worth headquarters of the American Airlines pilots’ union, was confrontational at times. At the table was Mr. Sinnett, along with Craig Bomben, a top Boeing test pilot, and one of the company’s senior lobbyists, John Moloney. They faced several union leaders, many of them angry at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Michael Michaelis, an American pilot, argued that Boeing should push the F.A.A. to issue what is known as an emergency airworthiness directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The F.A.A. had already issued one directive after the Lion Air crash, instructing airlines to revise their flight manuals to include information on how to respond to a malfunction of the anti-stall system known as MCAS. But Mr. Michaelis pushed Boeing to consider calling for an additional one to update the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Such a procedure would have required Boeing and airlines in the United States to take immediate action to ensure the safety of the Max, and would have likely taken the jet out of service temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“My question to you, as Boeing, is why wouldn’t you say this is the smartest thing to do?” Mr. Michaelis said. “Say we’re going to do everything we can to protect that traveling public in accordance with what our pilots unions are telling us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Sinnett didn’t budge, saying that it remained unclear that the new software, which automatically pushes the plane’s nose down, was responsible for the Lion Air crash. He added that he felt confident that pilots had adequate training to deal with a problem, especially now that pilots — who were not initially informed about the new system — were aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“You’ve got to understand that our commitment to safety is as great as yours,” Mr. Sinnett said in the meeting. “The worst thing that can ever happen is a tragedy like this, and the even worse thing would be another one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The pilots expressed frustration that Boeing did not inform them about the new software on the plane until after the Lion Air crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“These guys didn’t even know the damn system was on the airplane, nor did anybody else,” said Mr. Michaelis, the union’s head of safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Another American pilot, Todd Wissing, expressed frustration that no mention of the system had been included in the training manual for the 737 Max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0&quot;&gt;At the meeting, Boeing executives acknowledged they were looking into potential flaws in the design of the jet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot; class=&quot;css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Joshua Roberts/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“I would think that there would be a priority of putting explanations of things that could kill you,” Mr. Wissing said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;The Boeing executives, Mr. Sinnett and Mr. Bomben, explained that the company did not believe that pilots needed to know about the software, because they were already trained to deal with scenarios like the one on the doomed Lion Air flight. All pilots are expected to know how to take control of an aircraft when the plane’s tail begins moving in an uncontrolled way because of a malfunction, nudging the aircraft toward the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“The assumption is that the flight crews have been trained,” Mr. Sinnett said in the meeting. He added later: “Rightly or wrongly, that was the design criteria and that’s how the airplane was certified with the system and pilot working together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;When the pilots pressed Boeing to consider encouraging the F.A.A. to issue an emergency airworthiness directive, Mr. Sinnett made the case against moving too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“We don’t want to rush and do a crappy job of fixing the right things and we also don’t want to fix the wrong things,” Mr. Sinnett said, later adding, “For flight-critical software, I don’t think you want us to rush, rush it faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Sinnett acknowledged that the company was looking into potential mistakes in the design of the jet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“One of the questions will be, is our design assumption wrong?” Mr. Sinnett said. “We’re going through that whole thought process of, were our assumptions really even valid when we did this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;But he remained steadfast that pilots should know how to handle a malfunction of the new software on the plane, given their existing training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;As the meeting was concluding, Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the union, asked the Boeing executives whether they were still confident in the Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-53u6y8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;“Do you feel comfortable that the situation is under control today, before any software fix is implemented?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0&quot;&gt;Mr. Sinnett replied immediately: “Absolutely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-o6xoe7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>America&amp;#039;s loneliness epidemic: A systemic risk to organizations</title>
<link>https://www.smartbrief.com/original/2019/05/americas-loneliness-epidemic-hidden-systemic-risk-organizations</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smartbrief.com/original/2019/05/americas-loneliness-epidemic-hidden-systemic-risk-organizations</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about America’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ppar/article/27/4/127/4782506&quot;&gt;loneliness epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic&quot;&gt;in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;. The word “loneliness” in the work context is a misnomer. It doesn’t capture the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about all of the individuals who might not think of themselves as lonely and yet the &lt;a href=&quot;https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/overworked-america/&quot;&gt;demands of work&lt;/a&gt; and task-oriented activities such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2019/q3-2018-total-audience-report.html&quot;&gt;time in front of screens&lt;/a&gt; have crowded out time for anything more than superficial relationships? Many people lack sufficient, positive human connection (or social connection) and may be unaware of the ramifications. Left unchecked, the deficiency of connection today presents widespread risks not just to individuals but to organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a biological standpoint, social connection is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1313899/the-psychology-of-why-you-feel-alone-even-when-youre-surrounded-by-people/&quot;&gt;primal human need&lt;/a&gt;. Its presence appears to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8668748&quot;&gt;improve the cardiovascular, endocrine and immune systems’ performance&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, studies have shown that “disconnection” is unhealthy for individuals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these findings, it follows that researchers found greater employee loneliness leads to &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2015.1066&quot;&gt;poorer task, team role and relational performance&lt;/a&gt;. One might assume that the higher up the organization you go, the more connected you feel, but that isn’t necessarily the case. Research reported in Harvard Business Review found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2012/02/its-time-to-acknowledge-ceo-lo&quot;&gt;half of CEOs report feeling lonely&lt;/a&gt; and 61% of those CEOs believed it hindered their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prevalence of social disconnection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A considerable amount of evidence suggests that social disconnection is prevalent today. Based on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/&quot;&gt;research findings&lt;/a&gt;, Cigna reported data in 2018 that chronic loneliness in America has reached epidemic levels. This is consistent with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC5598785&amp;amp;blobtype=pdf&quot;&gt;earlier analysis&lt;/a&gt; on the potential public health relevance of social isolation and loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, it would appear that over the next decade the workforce may become even more disconnected. Since 2011, &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2019/WHR19_Ch5.pdf&quot;&gt;research on adolescents&lt;/a&gt; has found they spend more time interacting with electronic devices and less time interacting with each other, while also experiencing declining well-being. As artificial intelligence further increases the presence and role of machines in people’s day-to-day lives, an unintended consequence is that technology may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/robots-human-relationships/583204/&quot;&gt;diminish people’s ability to connect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The role of chronic stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is social disconnection problematic in the workplace? In answering this question one ought to address the topic of stress. While it is a term we often hear, it is difficult to fully comprehend the far-reaching psychological and physiological consequences associated with stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In measured amounts, stress serves to ready the nervous system for the task at hand. Here, odd as it sounds, stress can be a good thing. However, as Dr. Ted George of the National Institutes of Health describes in his book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Untangling-Mind-Why-Behave-Way/dp/0062127772&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Untangling-Mind-Why-Behave-Way/dp/0062127772&quot;&gt;Untangling the Mind&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; stress can have negative effects. With increasing levels of stress, the nervous system processes the stress as a threat. In extreme circumstances, stress moves the individual from being guided by rational thought processes to the instinctual responses characterized as “fight,” “flight” and “shutdown.”      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people experience chronic stress, they don’t feel well and often resort to ingesting substances or engaging in behaviors that provide temporary relief. The danger is that this may lead to developing addiction. In a review of 83 studies on addiction with at least 500 subjects, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134413/&quot;&gt;Sussman et al. (2011)&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly half the adult US population suffers from one or more addictions that have “serious negative consequences.” The addictions studied included substance addictions (alcohol, eating disorders, mood-altering legal and illegal drugs, and tobacco) and process addictions (dependence upon busyness and work, exercise, gambling, online gaming or social media, shopping, love and sex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best-known means to cope with stress is to increase positive social connections. Being in an environment that fosters supportive relationships and human connection serves to stabilize the responses of the nervous system, preventing it from processing the stressor as a threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultures of connection &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCLA neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman describes social connection as a “superpower” that makes individuals smarter, happier and more productive. Leaders at all levels of an organization would be wise to assess workplace culture through the lens of connection. Are attitudes, uses of language and behaviors drawing people together and connecting them? Or are they creating a stressful and/or relationally-toxic environment that pushes people apart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research, we found that cultures of connection are best for individual well-being and for helping organizations thrive too. Specifically, cultures of connection convey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Connection-Culture-Competitive-Advantage-Understanding/dp/1947308394&quot;&gt;several performance advantages upon organizations&lt;/a&gt; including higher employee engagement, tighter strategic alignment, superior decision-making, greater innovation and more adaptability to cope with rapid change taking place in the world today. These advantages add up to a powerful competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.smartbrief.com/sites/default/files/stencil.originals%2854%29_0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;758&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;World’s best hospital has connection in its DNA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of connection is on full display at Mayo Clinic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/quality/rankings&quot;&gt;America’s top-ranked hospital&lt;/a&gt; and arguably the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/2019/04/05/10-best-hospitals-world-1368512.html&quot;&gt;best hospital in the world&lt;/a&gt;. From the time of its founding in 1889, Mayo Clinic has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(16)30625-5/fulltext&quot;&gt;intentional about cultivating connection and community&lt;/a&gt;. Will Mayo, one of the earliest leaders, communicated an attitude that valued connection and warned about the dangers of isolation when he stated: “Our failures as a profession are the failures of individualism, the result of competitive medicine. It must be done by collective effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways this is manifest is in Mayo Clinic’s practice of compensating physicians through paying a salary rather than by an activity-based system. Not only does this promote collaboration for the good of the patient but it also alleviates the financial and time pressure of trying to see too many patients in a day, which often serves to diminish the physician-patient connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/mission-values&quot;&gt;Mayo Clinic’s stated mission and values&lt;/a&gt; point to being guided by the intent of its founders, the original Mayo physicians and Sisters of St. Francis. Mayo Clinic’s mission is “To inspire hope and contribute to health and well-being by providing the best care to every patient through &lt;em&gt;integrated&lt;/em&gt; clinical practice, education and research” (italics mine). The language used to describe its values includes the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Compassion … [that treats] patients and family members with sensitivity and empathy,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Healing [that nurtures] the well-being of the whole person, respecting physical, emotional and spiritual needs,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Teamwork [that values] the contributions of all, blending the skills of individual staff members in unsurpassed collaboration,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Innovation [to] infuse and energize the organization, enhancing the lives of those we serve, through the creative ideas and unique talents of each employee,” and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Excellence [that delivers] the best outcomes and highest quality service through the dedicated effort of every team member.”    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that words and phrases that reflect and enhance connection are woven throughout: sensitivity, empathy, treating the whole person (including emotional and spiritual needs), teamwork, blending skills of the team, unsurpassed collaboration, each employee and every team member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo Clinic’s belief in the importance of connection goes beyond attitudes and language to practical steps taken to see that connection is infused in the culture. &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalyst.nejm.org/videos/changing-culture-of-medicine/&quot;&gt;Mayo Clinic’s onboarding process&lt;/a&gt; for physicians and scientists includes extensive training in professionalism and communications, and assessments to help them develop emotional intelligence which is instrumental to connecting with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physician leaders are selected, developed and assessed based on their ability to connect, which includes listening, engaging, developing and leading other physicians. Informal opportunities for connection among colleagues is encouraged by providing dedicated meeting areas for physicians to gather in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo Clinic’s intentionality and commitment is evident in a program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://catalyst.nejm.org/getting-back-medicine-community/&quot;&gt;COMPASS (COlleagues Meeting to Promote and Sustain Satisfaction)&lt;/a&gt;. Under this initiative, self-formed groups of 6-10 physicians get together for about an hour every other week, usually over breakfast or lunch, with up to $20 provided to each participant to cover the meal cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meal, physicians spend at least 15 minutes focused on discussing assigned issues related to the physician experience, such as resiliency, medical mistakes, work-life balance and meaning at work. Mayo Clinic’s research has found that participants in COMPASS experience statistically significant improvements in multiple domains of wellbeing and satisfaction that will help reduce the risk of physician burnout and reduce medical errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For-profit organizations can develop cultures of connection, too. Consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.td.org/insights/why-culture-makes-costco-americas-best-employer&quot;&gt;connection culture of Costco&lt;/a&gt;, which Forbes and Statista research has consistently recognized as among the best large company employers in America, or the connection culture &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/fords-alan-mulally-and-superpower-connection&quot;&gt;Alan Mually cultivated&lt;/a&gt; when he led the turnaround of Ford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current epidemic of social disconnection has arisen from multiple avenues including loneliness, social isolation and the busyness and increased screen time of modern life crowding out time for face-to-face human connection. Social disconnection is making people more vulnerable to the negative effects of stress. After one considers the prevalence and effects of social disconnection throughout an organization, it can be argued that social disconnection presents a systemic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connection matters. Organizations should be intentional about developing and sustaining cultures of connection that provide the structures and needed psychosocial support to foster inclusion and teamwork, minimize stress and reduce error — all of which will promote superior organizational outcomes. The net benefit amounts to better employee and organizational health, resilience and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michaelleestallard.com/&quot;&gt;Michael Lee Stallard&lt;/a&gt;, president and cofounder of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.connectionculture.com&quot;&gt;Connection Culture Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, is a thought leader and speaker on how effective leaders boost human connection in team and organizational cultures to improve the health and performance of individuals and organizations.

<title>Netflix Saves Kids from Up to 400 Hours of Commercials a Year</title>
<link>https://localbabysitter.com/netflix-saves-our-kids-from-up-to-400-hours-of-commercials-a-year/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://localbabysitter.com/netflix-saves-our-kids-from-up-to-400-hours-of-commercials-a-year/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Even though kids these days are spending more and more times staring into their phones, television screen time is still a dominant source of entertainment for kids 2-11 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way most children are consuming television these days has shifted. Many homes are now “Netflix-only” homes, while others remain more traditional with standard cable packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We calculated a series of numbers related to standard television homes, compared them to Netflix-only homes and found an interesting trend with regard to how many commercials a streaming-only household can save their children from having to watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children 2-5 years old in Netflix-only homes are being saved from over 400 hours of commercials a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children 6-11 years old in Netflix-only homes are being saved from over 360 hours of commercials a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/tv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;study conducted by the University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; found that kids 2-5 spend an average of 32 hours per week in front of a television set. Children 6-11 spend 28 hours in front of a television set (there are some who believe the decrease between brackets is likely due to the slightly older kids now transitioning to phone time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average 2-5 year old is spending over 1,600 hours a year watching television.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average 6-11 year old is spending over 1,450 hours a year watching television.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ratings tracking company Nielsen reported in 2014 that the average hour of television has close to 15 minutes and 30 seconds of commercials&lt;/a&gt;. If calculated out over the above annual totals, both age brackets are saved from hundreds of hours of commercials every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, among others, have children’s entertainment options that offer commercial-free consumption of both educational and entertaining television. Think of all the hours of wacky toys and sugary cereal young children are being spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course it’s worth discussing YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is becoming fairly normal for kids as early as their toddler years to be watching YouTube for several hours a day. And while parents can get an ad-free experience through services like YouTube Red, most don’t (and even with YouTube Red, kids can still watch content from advertisers like toy company YouTube channels or unboxing videos, which are essentially toy ads as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we couldn’t find any specific data on whether or not a child in a home with standard television versus Netflix-only options watches more YouTube, we’re willing to bet the numbers are probably fairly equal. Kids love YouTube, and advertisers are throwing billions of dollars every year at the service to get their products in front of young audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also curious, as children of the 90s ourselves, does a child who grew up without a continual bombardment of ads end up more susceptible to advertising later in life? Did those early days of being shown ad after ad for LIFE Cereal end up turning us all into advertising cynics? No data yet on this, but something we’ll definitely be paying close attention to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ZombieLoad: Cross Privilege-Boundary Data Leakage on Intel CPUs</title>
<link>https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2019-05-14-zombieload.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2019-05-14-zombieload.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;ZombieLoad is a novel category of side-channel attacks which we refer to as &lt;strong&gt;data-sampling attack&lt;/strong&gt;. It demonstrates that faulting load instructions can transiently expose private values of one Hyperthread sibling to the other. This new exploit is the result of a collaboration between Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss and Moritz Lipp from Graz University of Technology, Thomas Prescher and Julian Stecklina from Cyberus Technology, Jo Van Bulck from KU Leuven, and Daniel Moghimi from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we summarize the implications and shed light on the different attack scenarios across CPU privilege rings, OS processes, virtual machines, and SGX enclaves, and give advice over possible ways to mitigate such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short summary of what this security vulnerability means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;By exploiting the CPU’s so-called bypass logic on return values of loads, it is possible to &lt;strong&gt;leak data across processes, privilege boundaries, Hyperthreads&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as values that are loaded inside &lt;strong&gt;Intel SGX enclaves&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;between VMs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code utilizing this exploit works on Windows, Linux, etc., as this is not a software- but a hardware issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to retrieve content that is currently being used by a Hyperthread sibling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even without Hyperthreading, it is possible to leak data out of other protection domains. During experimentation it turned out, that ZombieLoad leaks endure serializing instructions. Such leaks do however work with lower probability and are harder to obtain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is an &lt;em&gt;implementation detail&lt;/em&gt; what kind of data is processed after a faulty read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Spectre v1 gadgets, potentially any value in memory can be leaked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affected software:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;So far all versions of all operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS, BSDs, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All hypervisors (VMWare, Microsoft HyperV, KVM, Xen, Virtualbox, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All container solutions (Docker, LXC, OpenVZ, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code that uses secure &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions&quot;&gt;SGX&lt;/a&gt; enclaves in order to protect critical data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affected CPUs:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intel &lt;strong&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Xeon&lt;/strong&gt; CPUs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPUs with Meltdown/L1TF mitigations are affected by fewer variants of this attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were unable to reproduce this behavior on non-Intel CPUs and consider it likely that this is an implementation issue affecting only Intel CPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sole operating system/hypervisor software patches do not suffice for complete mitigation:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2018-08-14-l1-terminal-fault.html&quot;&gt;L1TF exploit&lt;/a&gt;, effective mitigations require switching off SMT (Simultaneous MultiThreading, aka Hyperthreads) or making sure that trusted and untrusted code do not share physical cores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about exploits like Meltdown/Spectre/ZombieLoad and their derivatives, their impact, or the involvement of Cyberus Technology GmbH, please contact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-attacks&quot;&gt;Example Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present two example attacks that are both mounted on a browser as the victim process. The browser leaking its data runs in one Hyperthread and the adversary application disclosing the values runs as sibling thread on the same physical core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;url-recovery&quot;&gt;URL Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, we reconstruct URLs that are being visited by the victim browser process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/assets/images/posts/zombieload/example_attack_on_browser.png&quot; alt=&quot;An unprivileged attacker with the ability to execute code can reconstruct URLs being visited in Firefox.&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An unprivileged attacker with the ability to execute code can reconstruct URLs being visited in Firefox.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its basic form, the attacker has no control over the leaked data i.e., it is necessary to filter for interesting data. Hence, our adversary app searches for typical URL prefixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, e.g., session cookies or credit card numbers follow predictable patterns in memory, hence represent a realistic target for such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;keyword-detection&quot;&gt;Keyword Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, we constantly sample data using ZombieLoad and match leaked values against a list of predefined keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;/assets/videos/posts/zombieload/tails-demo.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;
You should see a video of our POC exploit, but your browser does not support the video tag. &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
The adversary application prints keywords whenever the victim browser process handles data that matches the list of adversary keywords.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the video shows a browser that runs inside a VM: ZombieLoad leaks across sibling Hyperthreads regardless of virtual machine boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-background&quot;&gt;Technical Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: ZombieLoad is a transient-execution attack that observes the values of memory loads on the current physical core from a sibling thread. It exploits that the memory subsystem is shared among the logical cores of a physical core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;simultaneous-multithreading-hyperthreading&quot;&gt;Simultaneous Multithreading / Hyperthreading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;yper&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;hreading&lt;/a&gt; is Intel’s implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;imultaneous &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;ulti&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;hreading&lt;/a&gt;, both are also usually abbreviated as HT and SMT. This section explains the value of HT/SMT for the performance and power efficiency of modern CPUs, and also why it imposes security risks that are exposed by the discovery of ZombieLoad (and similarly by L1TF/Foreshadow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMT boosts the CPU’s instruction throughput by increasing the utilization of the independent execution units that exist within the pipeline. Already without SMT, the CPU architecture is capable of decomposing the instruction sequence into operations like loads, stores, and calculations. For different kinds of operations the CPU has different execution units (EUs). EUs that are in high demand are replicated. Operations that do not depend on each other can be processed in parallel by the corresponding EUs. The higher their utilization, the higher the overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In program sequences with too many dependencies between operations, a lot of EUs might end up idling. SMT further increases CPU utilization by running two threads concurrently on one physical core. Processing two instruction streams increases the probability of finding independent operations to assign to the available EUs that might otherwise sit idle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/assets/images/posts/zombieload/smt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Execution unit utilization without vs. with simultaneous multithreading&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Execution unit utilization without vs. with simultaneous multithreading&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagram shows an example load of two threads that both individually do not fully utilize the CPU’s EUs. Arrows show dependencies between the operations and blocks with alphabetic suffix model operations that take more than one CPU cycle. Complex arithmetic, for example, requires more time, and memory values are always not immediately available. With SMT enabled, the CPU’s EUs can be fully utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If SMT is enabled, the operating system sees two independent CPUs where only one physical core exists. Such &lt;em&gt;logical cores&lt;/em&gt; each have their private &lt;em&gt;architectural state&lt;/em&gt;, but they share most of their execution resources - which is one of the reasons why SMT greatly improves energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/assets/images/posts/zombieload/st_mt_modes.png&quot; alt=&quot;State Sharing between logical CPU cores in multithreading mode&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;State Sharing between logical CPU cores in multithreading mode&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second diagram visualizes how some parts of a physical core’s resources are shared between two logical cores if it is run in multithreading (MT) mode. If one of the cores is currently not operating (e.g., after executing a &lt;code&gt;halt&lt;/code&gt; instruction) or Hyperthreading is deactivated, all resources belong to the only running logical core (see modes ST0 and ST1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the operating system schedules two threads from completely different applications on the logical cores of the same physical core, data of both applications is processed at the same time in the shared execution resources. ZombieLoad exploits this circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;transient-execution-of-faulting-reads&quot;&gt;Transient Execution of Faulting Reads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPUs maximize execution unit utilization by speculating when it is unclear what has to be done next: Conditional jumps that depend on values that are yet to be calculated are an example, because it cannot be known for sure in advance if the jump shall be taken or not. If the speculation is wrong, the pipeline rolls back all wrongly performed operations and ensures that none of their results become visible outside the CPU so that the system stays in a correct state. Otherwise, if the speculation is right (which just needs to be “most of the time”), the CPU’s degree of utilization, and hence its performance, was successfully increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions that are executed speculatively or out-of-order but whose results are never committed to architectural state are called &lt;strong&gt;transient instructions&lt;/strong&gt;. Any fault that occurs during transient execution of an instruction is handled when the instruction &lt;em&gt;retires&lt;/em&gt;, the last pipeline stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an instruction stream depends on a value from a read operation that turns out to trigger a fault of some kind, the vulnerable CPUs speculatively use &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; value placeholder during transient execution. Such faults may be of architectural (e.g., exceptions) or of microarchitectural nature (e.g., updates of accessed/dirty bits in the page table). Normally, this does not present a problem, because the effects of this calculation will never leave the retire phase. By using side channels like the CPU cache subsystem (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberus-technology.de/posts/2018-01-03-meltdown.html&quot;&gt;our article about Meltdown&lt;/a&gt; explains this in detail), this placeholder value can be extracted by an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-attack&quot;&gt;The Attack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZombieLoad enables four different attack scenarios. All of them have in common that they trigger a faulty read, and extract data used by transiently executed operations via a side-channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already stated in the technical background section, operations that depend on the value of a faulty read operation may be executed transiently with wrong data. It is an &lt;em&gt;implementation detail&lt;/em&gt; what kind of data is processed during that time window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that on Intel processors this wrong data may be data from &lt;strong&gt;outside the current process&lt;/strong&gt; but still loaded by the physical CPU core for whatever reason, which can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;data from kernel space or other applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data from outside the VM: other VM or hypervisor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data from inside a currently executing SGX enclave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important detail is that the attacker has no direct control over what data is read here. Leaked data could be uninteresting because it comes from an irrelevant other process, VM, etc. If it comes from the right process, it might still be the wrong data, because the address from which the data is returned is beyond the attacker’s control. (In Meltdown or L1TF, on the other hand, the attacker &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; the address.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this restriction, the class of attacks that ZombieLoad enables is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;data-sampling attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. The attacker simply samples leaking data that is currently being used by the victim process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;attack-scenarios&quot;&gt;Attack Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different attack scenarios are described in the following, accompanied with attacker model and example scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These attack scenarios can be enhanced in a way that gives the attacker control over the addresses from which data is leaked. In order to achieve that, they can be combined with the use of Spectre-v1 gadgets which lead the CPU into prefetching interesting data from specific addresses. We are going to mention where this can be useful, but will not go into detail as this goes beyond the scope of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;cross-process-user-space-leakage&quot;&gt;Cross-Process User Space Leakage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the attacker executes unprivileged code on one logical CPU core, while a victim application runs on the other logical (but same physical) core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim application could be a browser or password manager application which contains secrets. While the victim application is dealing with interesting data, the attacker triggers faulty read operations in his own thread and samples leaked data from the victim process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker has no control over the address from which data is leaked, therefore it is necessary to know &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the victim application handles the interesting data. For example, if the attacker is looking for AES keys, he can use the fact that shared libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; are usually used for encryption and decryption. By flushing the sections of the shared AES encryption/decryption routines out of the cache, the attacker thread can sample the access times for such addresses - they would suddenly go down in case the victim process started executing such code again. This is the moment in which the probability of leaking (parts) of the AES keys rises and the data-sampling attack can be started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;intel-sgx-leakage&quot;&gt;Intel SGX Leakage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The victim code that utilizes SGX and the attacker code are assumed to be run on the same physical core, but different logical core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGX’s typical threat model assumes that enclaves are still secure, even if the attacker has full control over the surrounding operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under such conditions, ZombieLoad allows for leaking data of running secure enclave code with the same strategy as in the cross-process user space leakage attack scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;virtual-machine-leakage&quot;&gt;Virtual Machine Leakage&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the cross-process user space leakage scenario, attacker code and victim code run on the same physical but different logical core. In this scenario, both attacker and victim may run on individual virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker might for example upload and run a prepared guest image on a cloud hosting service where the VMs of other customers are co-located in order to leak their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;kernel-leakage-without-hyperthreading&quot;&gt;Kernel Leakage without Hyperthreading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with Hyperthreading disabled, ZombieLoad allows to leak data from other protection domains on the same logical core. If a faulty read leaks data during transient execution, this data may also originate from kernel space. Such an attack would be mounted after transitions between kernel space and user space, e.g., return paths from system calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacks of this class are much harder to mount because the return paths from such other protection domains to the user space/VM are less likely to leak interesting values. One reason for this are serializing instructions which do not prevent leakage in general, but reduce the amount of leaking memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to trigger leaks from interesting memory addresses, the attacker could combine the use of Spectre-style gadgets prior to mounting a ZombieLoad attack. Such gadgets may be hard to find on the return paths to user space/VM. They could, however, be deliberately installed in proprietary software in order to provide backdoors, and would be very hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cross-vm-covert-channel&quot;&gt;Cross-VM Covert Channel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an attack scenario per se, or at least a very different one compared to the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ZombieLoad as a covert channel, two VMs could communicate with each other even in scenarios where they are configured in a way that forbids direct interaction between them. For example, isolation policies could be in place such that one VM offers unrestricted Internet access (watching YouTube videos) while the other has access to the corporate network, only (reading confidential documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mitigation-techniques&quot;&gt;Mitigation Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safest workaround to prevent this extremely powerful attack is running trusted and untrusted applications on &lt;strong&gt;different physical machines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is not feasible in given contexts, &lt;strong&gt;disabling Hyperthreading&lt;/strong&gt; completely represents the safest mitigation. This does not, however, close the door on attacks on system call return paths that leak data from kernel space to user space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case disabling HT is not feasible for performance or other reasons, trusted and untrusted processes should never be scheduled on the same physical core. This, again, does not mitigate all attacker scenarios, because adversary processes could still leak data from the super ordinated kernel or hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more detailed information about mitigation vectors, please consult the ZombieLoad research paper.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MDS: Microarchitectural Data Sampling side-channel vulnerabilities in Intel CPUs</title>
<link>https://mdsattacks.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mdsattacks.com</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;Our attacks can &lt;strong&gt;leak confidential data&lt;/strong&gt; across arbitrary security boundaries in real-world settings (cloud, browsers, etc.). The reason our attacks are impervious to all the existing defenses against speculative execution attacks is that they can leak &lt;strong&gt;in-flight data&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike other recent attacks such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://meltdownattack.com&quot;&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meltdownattack.com/&quot;&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreshadowattack.eu&quot;&gt;Foreshadow&lt;/a&gt; which are based on vulnerabilities leaking data from the CPU caches, &lt;abbr title=&quot;Rogue In-flight Data Load&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIDL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fallout&lt;/strong&gt; collect data from internal CPU buffers (&lt;em&gt;Line Fill Buffers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Load Ports&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Store Buffers&lt;/em&gt;). Intel describes the exploited vulnerabilities as &quot;Microarchitectural Data Sampling&quot; (&lt;strong&gt;MDS&lt;/strong&gt;) - where &quot;sampling&quot; is another way of saying that we can &lt;em&gt;leak&lt;/em&gt; in-flight (or &quot;sampled&quot;) data from many of these microarchitectural buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, our research shows that what last year appeared to be exceptional one-time speculative execution bugs are actually systemic, and the problems in modern CPUs may go much deeper than we initially thought. If CPUs have become so complex that chip vendors cannot keep their security under control, hardware vulnerabilities will be the new hunting ground for sophisticated attackers. And we may have no idea how many zero-day hardware vulnerabilities are still up for grabs. If we can no longer trust our hardware, the foundation on which we build all security solutions is crumbling away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Share this story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has cut more than 23,000 jobs since receiving a big tax cut at the end of 2017, despite lobbying heavily for the tax cut by claiming that it would create thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/att_to_invest_an_additional_1_billion_in_the_united_states_if_competitive_tax_rate_enacted.html&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T in November 2017&lt;/a&gt; pushed for the corporate tax cut by promising to invest an additional $1 billion in 2018, with CEO Randall Stephenson &lt;a href=&quot;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atandt-ceo-says-theyll-invest-least-1-billion-create-7000-jobs-tax-reform-passes-200245187.html&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;every billion dollars AT&amp;amp;T invests is 7,000 hard-hat jobs. These are not entry-level jobs. These are 7,000 jobs of people putting fiber in ground, hard-hat jobs that make $70,000 to $80,000 per year.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corporate tax cut was subsequently passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017. The tax cut &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-sees-big-benefit-from-tax-law-1517434789&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; gave AT&amp;amp;T an extra $3 billion in cash in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But AT&amp;amp;T cut capital spending and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/att-sued-over-layoffs-after-promising-more-investment-because-of-tax-cut/&quot;&gt;kept laying people off&lt;/a&gt; after the tax cut. A union analysis of AT&amp;amp;T's publicly available financial statements &quot;shows the telecom company eliminated 23,328 jobs since the Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed in late 2017, including nearly 6,000 in the first quarter of 2019,&quot; the Communications Workers of America (CWA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/att-cut-over-23000-jobs-congress-passed-tax-bill&quot;&gt;said yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T's total employment was 254,000 as of December 31, 2017 and rose to &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/1q-2019/1Q19_Trending%20Schedules.pdf&quot;&gt;262,290 by March 31, 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But AT&amp;amp;T's overall workforce increased only because of its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. and two smaller companies, which together added 31,618 employees during 2018, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/annual-reports/2018/2019-notice-of-annual-meeting-and-proxy-statement.pdf&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T proxy statement&lt;/a&gt; cited in the CWA report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding employees gained via mergers, AT&amp;amp;T's workforce dropped from 254,000 to 230,672, a cut of 23,328 jobs, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/20190508-cwa-att-jobs-report-update.pdf&quot;&gt;CWA report&lt;/a&gt; points out. These numbers are for AT&amp;amp;T's global workforce, but the vast majority of its employees are in the US. AT&amp;amp;T reported having 44,892 non-US employees as of October 1, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent layoffs affected 368 union technicians in California, the CWA &lt;a href=&quot;https://district9.cwa-union.org/news/releases/despite-promises-att-announces-california-layoffs&quot;&gt;said last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also cut more than 10,000 jobs each year in 2016 and 2017. AT&amp;amp;T had 281,450 employees &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/annual-reports/2016/att-ar2016-completefinancialreview.pdf&quot;&gt;as of December 31, 2015&lt;/a&gt;, 268,540 as of December 31, 2016, and 254,000 by the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T slashed capital spending, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;AT&amp;amp;T's annual report also shows the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-executives-pay-climbed-after-media-takeover-11552347851&quot;&gt;boosted executive pay&lt;/a&gt; and suggests that after refunds, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/20190325-att-gop-tax-cuts.pdf&quot;&gt;it paid no cash income taxes in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and slashed capital investments by $1.4 billion,&quot; the CWA wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T reported $21.6 billion in capital expenses in &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/att_fourth_quarter_earnings_2017.html&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and $21.3 billion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/2019/att_fourth_quarter_earnings_2018.html&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, a cut of $300 million. CWA told Ars that the cut is $1.4 billion when &quot;excluding federal government reimbursements for the construction of FirstNet,&quot; AT&amp;amp;T's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/att-gets-6-5-billion-to-build-us-wide-public-safety-network/&quot;&gt;government-funded public safety network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T capital spending is already down more than $900 million this year, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/1q-2019/1Q19%20Investor%20Briefing.pdf&quot;&gt;the telco reported&lt;/a&gt; Q1 2019 capital expenditures of $5.18 billion, down from $6.12 billion in Q2 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What AT&amp;amp;T is doing to hardworking people across America is disgraceful,&quot; CWA President Chris Shelton said in the union announcement. &quot;Congress needs to investigate AT&amp;amp;T to find out how it is using its tax windfall since the company's own publicly available data already raise serious alarm bells. AT&amp;amp;T got its tax cut. Where are the jobs?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T's actual capital spending of $21.3 billion in 2018 is far short of what AT&amp;amp;T told investors to expect at the beginning of 2018, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.att.com/story/att_fourth_quarter_earnings_2017.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that full-year capital spending would &quot;approach&quot; $25 billion and be &quot;$23 billion net of expected FirstNet reimbursements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T cuts jobs in “declining” business units&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contacted by Ars, AT&amp;amp;T didn't deny any of the CWA's findings about job cuts. &quot;We continue to hire in areas where we're seeing increasing demand for products and services, but technology is changing rapidly, and that affects hiring and employment,&quot; AT&amp;amp;T told Ars. &quot;There are fewer jobs in parts of the business that are declining and facing technology shifts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also said that it &quot;recently opened new 500-seat call centers in Chicago; Houston; Sunrise, Fla.; and Mesa, Ariz. and that &quot;[m]ost of the jobs at these call centers will be filled by union-represented employees.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said it takes several steps to keep existing employees despite lowering its overall workforce. AT&amp;amp;T said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work very hard to keep employees through these transitions: through normal attrition when possible, follow-the-work offers (frequently with a relocation allowance), internal job-matching programs, and voluntary severance offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many union-represented employees have a job offer guarantee that ensures they are offered another job with the company if their current job is eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we wrote about AT&amp;amp;T layoffs &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/att-reportedly-plans-layoffs-despite-tax-cut-and-fcc-deregulation/&quot;&gt;in January this year&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T told Ars that &quot;we hired more than 20,000 new employees last year and more than 17,000 the year before.&quot; But the company's financial statements make it clear that new hirings fell far short of job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While AT&amp;amp;T responds to criticism of its massive job cuts with boasts about hiring, hiring to address turnover is not the same as job creation,&quot; the CWA said yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
