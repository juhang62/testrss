<title>The U.S. government is about to bar the IRS from creating a free e-filing system</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Thanks to pressure from tax preparation industry, Congress is getting ready to ban the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/internal-revenue-service-irs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;internal-revenue-service-irs&quot;&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; from ever building a free electronic tax filing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-is-about-to-ban-the-government-from-offering-free-online-tax-filing-thank-turbotax&quot;&gt;As ProPublica reports&lt;/a&gt;, the effort is a bipartisan one. The House Ways and Means Committee, led by Massachusetts Democrat, Richard Neal, passed the Taxpayer First Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would make changes to the IRS and is sponsored by Georgia Democratic Congressman &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/john-lewis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;john-lewis&quot;&gt;John Lewis&lt;/a&gt; and Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of its stipulations would make it illegal for the IRS to create its own online system for tax filing. That’s right, members of Congress are prohibiting a branch of the federal government from providing a much-needed service that would make the lives of all of their constituents much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why is Congress taking the step? Because companies like &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/intuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;intuit&quot;&gt;Intuit,&lt;/a&gt; the company behind &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/turbotax&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;turbotax&quot;&gt;TurboTax,&lt;/a&gt; and H&amp;amp;R Block have been lobbying lawmakers for years to take the step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other countries, the agencies in charge of taxes have their own programs which make filing taxes more efficient — and free — for citizens. But that would eat into the profits for the tax prep industry, which was estimated to pull in $11 billion in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This could be a disaster. It could be the final nail in the coffin of the idea of the IRS ever being able to create its own program,” Mandi Matlock, a tax attorney who does work for the National Consumer Law Center, told ProPublica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways that the IRS could make tax preparation easier for taxpayers dealing with the only certainty in life other than death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRS could develop a free online system. It could also submit pre-prepared tax returns for people to approve and then file based on the salary data the agency already has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 70% of American taxpayers are already able to file for free online, but only 3% do, according to data from the taxpayer advocacy organization, &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Free_File_Program_Is_Failing_to_Achieve_Objectives&quot;&gt;The Taxpayer Advocate Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans who make less than $66,000 can access the Free File Inc. software online through the IRS.gov website and all taxpayers can download electronic versions of IRS paper forms through the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2002, the IRS entered into an agreement with a consortium fo tax software companies, which was known as &lt;a title=&quot;Free File, Inc. (FFI)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/about-the-free-file-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Free File, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;  As part of that deal, the companies agreed to open up access to filing software for about taxpayers who make less than $66,000 and the IRS agreed not to compete with the companies by developing its own software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That deal has been renewed for over a decade and the new bill before Congress would make it permanent. One reason why folks Congress could be pushing this through is all of the money that H&amp;amp;R Block and Intuit spent to lobby Senators and Representatives. ProPublica estimates that the tax prep industry has spent $6.6 million to advocate for the IRS filing deal. The Ways and Means chair, Neal, received $16,000 in contributions from the two companies in the last two election cycles, according to the ProPublica report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>U.S. senators introduce social media bill to ban &amp;#039;dark patterns&amp;#039; tricks</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech/u-s-senators-introduce-social-media-bill-to-ban-dark-patterns-tricks-idUSKCN1RL25Q</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech/u-s-senators-introduce-social-media-bill-to-ban-dark-patterns-tricks-idUSKCN1RL25Q</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday to ban online social media companies like Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc from tricking consumers into giving up their personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill from Mark Warner, a Democrat, and Deb Fischer, a Republican, would also ban online platforms with more than 100 million monthly active users from designing addicting games or other websites for children under age 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill takes aim at practices that online platforms use to mislead people into giving personal data to companies or otherwise trick them. The so-called “dark patterns” were developed using behavioral psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Misleading prompts to just click the ‘OK’ button can often transfer your contacts, messages, browsing activity, photos, or location information without you even realizing it,” Fischer said in a statement issued by both senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on how social media companies collect information about users could hurt their ability to sell advertisements, a key source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A website aimed at tracking dark patterns identifies behavior, such as a website or app showing that a user has new notifications when they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner said in an interview on CNBC that the legislation could be included in a federal privacy bill that lawmakers in the Senate Commerce Committee are drafting. Congress has been expected to take up privacy legislation after California passed a strict privacy law that goes into effect next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner noted that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Google and others have expressed support for privacy regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The platform companies are now going to have an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is, to see if they support this legislation and other approaches,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would bar companies from choosing groups of people for behavioral experiments unless the companies get informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the bill, social media companies would create a professional standards body to create best practices to deal with the issue. The Federal Trade Commission, which investigates deceptive advertising, would work with the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Google, Twitter and other free online services rely on advertising for revenue, and use data collected on users to more effectively target those ads.The story refiles to fix typographical error in last paragraph to make it “rely” instead of “relay”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Phone Addicts Are the New Drunk Drivers</title>
<link>http://blog.zendrive.com/2019-distracted-driving-study-phone-addicts-are-the-new-drunk-drivers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.zendrive.com/2019-distracted-driving-study-phone-addicts-are-the-new-drunk-drivers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every April, to commemorate Distracted Driving Awareness Month, Zendrive shares insights from the largest dataset about how people drive. For our third annual Distracted Driving Study, we analyzed over 160 billion miles of driver data to uncover a dangerous new category of distracted drivers: Phone Addicts. This growing category of hyper-connected individuals exhibit a pattern of distracted behavior unlike any other group of risky drivers on the road &lt;strong&gt;and you may be one of them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, 6,227 pedestrians lost their lives to the hands of drivers who were most likely driving under the influence of a smartphone. On a national level, drivers are 10 percent more distracted this year than last. And from out under the shadows, Phone Addicts have positioned themselves as public enemy number one, replacing drunk drivers as the ultimate threat on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phone Addicts Don’t Notice or Care That They’re Driving Distracted&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone Addicts are glued to their phones, so they’re more distracted, more dangerous, and more likely to cause a crash. When comparing this year’s data to the 2018 report, we found that the number of ‘Phone Addicts’ doubled in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, ‘Phone Addicts:’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spend 3x more drive time actively using their phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively ignore the road 28% of the time they’re driving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are on the road 1.5x more times than the general population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are more of a public danger than drunk drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand what drives this behavior, we launched our first-ever Distracted Driving Survey, talking directly to drivers. The survey found that people know distracted driving is a problem, but aren’t concerned enough to change their behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;85% of respondents acknowledged distracted driving is a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90% claimed to be safe drivers, but…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47% admitted to using phones 10% or more of the time while driving, classifying them as ‘Phone Addicts.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-1024x512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-3282&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-200x100.jpg 200w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-768x384.jpg 768w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-1240x620.jpg 1240w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-860x430.jpg 860w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-680x340.jpg 680w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-500x250.jpg 500w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-400x200.jpg 400w, http://blog.zendrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Survey-results-1-50x25.jpg 50w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The least safe drivers are ignorant of the danger they pose… which means any of us could be a threat to those around us and not know it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Driver Phone Use Really Worse than Drunk Driving?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our blatant overconfidence paired by a relentless addiction to stay connected is clear. But how does this stack up against drunk driving? Could driver phone use really be worse?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2006 study conducted by the University of Utah, cell phone drivers were found to be just as bad as drunks. However, when controlling for driving conditions and time on task, smartphone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers. The study revealed that the driving abilities of cell phone users are akin to drivers with the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers specifically found that cell phone users are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are more likely to crash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive more slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 percent slower to deploy the brakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24 percent more variance in their following distance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19 percent slower to return to normal speed after braking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know distracted drivers’ behavior is at least as dangerous as drunk drivers. But Phone Addicts outnumber drunk drivers, too. According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, the highest number of drunk drivers are on the road between midnight and 3 am, with fatal crashes four times higher at night than during the day. Our data shows Phone Addicts are on the road at every hour of the day, with peak hours during times most folks are on the road, between 7 am and 6 pm. Which means that both in number and in timing, distracted drivers are a bigger danger than drunk drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

This progress, although significant, has taken decades to accomplish. With all of the data and information available to us today, does it need to take an entire generation to eradicate distracted driving?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one thing is certain, our driving patterns in 2018 cannot be carried into the future. 2019 will be a decisive year in the fight against driver phone use. If not curbed, this massive epidemic will lead to a significant rise in traffic fatalities and seismic challenges in the coming decade. While the hope of zero traffic fatalities remains alive, a serious threshold has been crossed in terms of the number of distracted drivers we should tolerate on public roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pledge to #TextYouLater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we have the chance to make history and create safer roads for all. To help people concentrate on the road, Zendrive is launching the #TextYouLater challenge. Participants are encouraged to set up their driving autoresponders (through “Do Not Disturb While Driving” mode on iOS devices, and through “Android Auto” on Android devices), take a screenshot, then tweet their pledge while tagging their friends to do the same. Autoresponders reduce distractions like texting and calls, two of the most common activities found in the study, and can make the roads safer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you to take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://b.link/TextYouLater&quot;&gt;#TextYouLater pledge on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and partner with us to create safer roads for all!

<title>Announcing Building Git</title>
<link>https://blog.jcoglan.com/2019/04/08/announcing-building-git/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.jcoglan.com/2019/04/08/announcing-building-git/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.jcoglan.com/2017/02/12/the-myers-diff-algorithm-part-1/&quot;&gt;series of articles&lt;/a&gt; about diff and merge algorithms, and promised that one day they would form part of a book about the Git version control system. In 2018 I didn’t write anything at all on this blog, and that’s because I was writing that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over a month ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/&quot;&gt;Building Git&lt;/a&gt; was published, and so far has sold 390 copies. I’ve done a couple of interviews about it (one for &lt;a href=&quot;http://yakshave.fm/13&quot;&gt;The Yak Shave&lt;/a&gt;, and one yet to be published), and one question you get asked a lot if you write a book is: why did you write it? So in this article I want to expand a little on what the book’s about, why I wrote it, and who I think it’s for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick answer to why I wrote it is, well, for the hell of it. For the same reason I wrote those diff articles, I was interested in digging in and learning as much as I could, out of sheer curiosity, and I hope as much comes across to readers. It was always supposed to be a side project alongside my day job, not something I’d be working on full time. But that’s not a very useful answer, and it’s worth reflecting on why I was interested in doing it and what motivated me to finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there’s the surface reason: Git is notoriously confusing to new users, and they are frequently instructed to learn how it works inside in order to understand the user interface. While this is true, it’s a slightly unsatisfying answer: this is really a design problem in Git rather than a shortcoming in its users. There are already numerous excellent write-ups of how git works at various levels of abstraction: &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2&quot;&gt;Pro Git&lt;/a&gt; gives a good account, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html&quot;&gt;Gitlet&lt;/a&gt; is an accessible and concise demonstration of these concepts in code, and many other third-party implementations exist. Why write another one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the second-level motivation I had: writing an implementation of a complex program like Git exposes you to a very broad range of computer science topics, from abstract mathematical ideas like models of concurrent editing, to the details of the Unix filesystem API. Most technical books are very narrowly focussed and designed to be easily keyword-marketed: you want to learn this year’s hot framework, you can quickly find half a dozen books on it, you pick one, work through, put it on your CV, rinse repeat. There’s nothing wrong with this per se: people need to learn things for their jobs and the tech book market does a reasonable job of serving this need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a kind of learning that this model does not lend itself to, and that’s seeing how all this disparate stuff fits together. Most books necessarily draw on other topics in order to build useful programs, but for reasons of scope they must assume the reader already knows these incidental topics. If you don’t know them, it can be unclear where to go find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take a degree in a subject, someone has developed a curriculum to guide you through the field and integrate the various topics you learn along the way. As a self-directed learner, it’s much harder to find that story among the mountain of targeted books available, and so I wanted to write something that was more of an extended project. Not something you approach with a checklist of things to learn, but something that takes you on a journey through a lot of topics you didn’t even know existed, and shows you how they fit together into a big picture. Something that goes through the process of building a reasonably large program rather than showing you some toy examples and leaving the rest up to your imagination. I wanted to bridge the gap between the scope of typical educational examples, and the sort of system people work on in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secondary effect of the book’s broad scope is how it changes the narrative. Most book examples are of a size where you can show the reader the entire thing at once, and then explain how it works. What this leaves out is the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of getting to the end design, and this is a topic that developers tend to struggle with a great deal, especially in legacy systems and refactoring. They know the end state they want a system to arrive at, but they find it hard to make the journey there incrementally, and being comfortable with the idea of deploying it gradually, leading to the One Big Rewrite model where you hack for six months and then do an incredibly risky roll-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcoglan/jit&quot;&gt;Jit&lt;/a&gt;, the codebase that &lt;em&gt;Building Git&lt;/em&gt; describes, is about 6,000 lines of Ruby code. I believe it’s impossible to describe such a codebase in a linear fashion where you show the end state of the project and attempt to explain it. A lot of it only makes sense if you go on the journey to get there, building up each piece of functionality in small increments, and refactoring when necessary. Looking only at the current state of a codebase leaves out a lot of information that you can only get from its history, and that’s why version control logs are so valuable. As well as the content in the book, Jit’s commit logs contain over 30,000 words of text, including a lot of things I couldn’t fit into the book – think of it as the extended footnotes. For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcoglan/jit/commit/74398616e646f98c18e7990407d5c37f79149a8d&quot;&gt;one commit&lt;/a&gt; I use some type theory to derive an abstraction that unifies two apparently different structures, so that a single class can work with both of them. I find it hard to explain why such abstractions exist without going through the process that led to them, and I think there’s a gap in technical literature to explore this outside of books specifically dedicated to the process of changing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s the big picture stuff. Why did I choose Ruby? Well you have to choose something, and I know Ruby, and that’s about all the justification I can offer. It’s not that I didn’t evaluate other languages, but for me Ruby led to the least amount of incidental complexity in the early material in terms of installation, project structure, build tooling and so on, and it has a rich enough standard library that you don’t need any third party code to do this project. I wanted the book to be able to cross language barriers and not be a &lt;em&gt;Ruby book&lt;/em&gt;, and so I’m really glad people are following it in other languages. So far I know of people doing it in C++, Clojure, Elixir, Go, Haskell, Java, Node.js, Rust, and Swift. Having said that, I do believe Ruby lowered the language barrier more than I personally could have done in other languages, and doing this project reminded me of why I like it so much. That doesn’t mean it’s The Best Language, it was just the best language for me, for this project, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the choice of Ruby is also significant for cultural reasons. I’ve spent most of my career so far in web development, and Ruby is primarily known for its role in that space. It’s dismissed as a language you cannot write programs like Git in – it’s too slow, it’s too “high level” – and web developers are dismissed as not being “real programmers” by other parts of the tech ecosystem. What is a “real programmer”? I don’t know, I just know that people who work in my sector are often told they aren’t one. Real programmers know C. Real programmers work in systems programming. Real programmers do open source. Real programmers can tell you &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/312006066&quot;&gt;every member of every good data structure from 1962 to 1978&lt;/a&gt;. But they don’t write web apps, oh no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a huge section of the tech ecosystem that’s constantly told they’re not smart enough to be here and that their work doesn’t matter. I spent a decade hearing C was beyond mere mortals, that you must be a genius to go anyway near low-level code, or algorithms, or distributed systems. The inventor of Git is notorious for pushing this narrative! But the truth is, anyone with enough brains and patience to learn how to do any kind of computing is “smart enough” to learn things like this. The thing that makes any kind of programming hard is gigantic functions that do seven different tangentially related things and hide important concepts so that their file formats end up with half a dozen different ways to encode an integer. It’s programs like that where you can’t actually see the system design in the code; if your codebase looks like that it’s going to be difficult in any language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote this book for the not-real programmers, the people told they’re not hardcore enough, that programs like Git are written by brain geniuses and that mere mortals cannot understand them. I was inspired by Gary Bernhardt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog&quot;&gt;From Scratch&lt;/a&gt; videos, and by Julia Evans’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wizardzines.com/&quot;&gt;zines&lt;/a&gt;, that demystify everyday software tools. I want you to feel like there’s nothing about computers you can’t ultimately figure out, and it has been so rewarding to see people publishing their first commits with their own Git clones, full of excitement at the world they’ve just created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/&quot;&gt;buy &lt;em&gt;Building Git&lt;/em&gt; via my shop&lt;/a&gt;, and if you enjoy it I’d really appreciate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44128595-building-git&quot;&gt;review on Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Marissa Mayer on career growth and how a revenue guarantee almost killed Google</title>
<link>https://triplebyte.com/blog/marissa-mayer-interview</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://triplebyte.com/blog/marissa-mayer-interview</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;q&gt;I remember when we made a huge revenue guarantee to AOL to get the account. We did a best-case scenario projection, a middle of the road projection, and a worst-case scenario projection. Worst-case scenario and middle of the road had us going out of business with the contract. The best-case scenario had us breaking even.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marissa Mayer was one of the earliest employees at Google and helped to shape both Gmail and Google Maps. Mayer became the CEO of Yahoo in 2012, a position she held until 2017 when Yahoo was acquired by Verizon for $4.48 billion. In 2018, she co-founded Lumi Labs, a startup incubator in Palo Alto focusing on consumer media and AI. Marissa Mayer recently sat down with Triplebyte's CEO, Harj Taggar, to discuss her career in tech and the advice she gives to new engineers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited for clarity and style. Marissa Mayer is a Triplebyte investor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you pursue a career in technology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally I thought I was going to go into medicine, and I was very committed to majoring in Biology and Chemistry at Stanford. But shortly after I arrived, I bought a computer with my babysitting money, and I took an Introduction to Computer Science class for non-majors in order to fulfill a requirement. It's funny—on the first day of class, the lecturer said, &lt;q&gt;Studies have shown that of the 400 of you sitting in this introductory class, exactly two of you will go on to take any further Computer Science classes, so I'm gonna make this easy on everyone.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly I was one of those two people who went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the rest of the Computer Science core over the course of my B.A. and M.A., because I loved that introductory course. It was the very early days of what would later blossom into the internet. Netscape had just gotten started. Yahoo was getting started—although it was still “David and Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web,” and it was hosted in Jerry Yang's student directory at Stanford. I was introduced to a lot of things at that time—the Mosaic browser, things like that—all through CS105 at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to stay at Stanford to pursue a master's degree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I already knew that I wanted to do more school. My undergraduate degree was in Symbolic Systems, which I studied because I wanted more breadth as an undergrad, but for my master's I decided I wanted more depth. There were only 13 classes in artificial intelligence offered at Stanford at that time, and I'd taken seven of them for my undergraduate. I realized that, while I had a very deep understanding of artificial intelligence, I did not yet have some of the basics down. I knew how a database worked. I knew how an operating system worked. I knew how a compiler worked. But I hadn't taken classes on those topics, so I went back for my master's and took the rest of the AI offerings as well as a lot of programming basics. That way, I could actually go and market myself as a software engineer and say, “I've written a compiler. I've written an operating system. I've written a database. I know how they work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you get serious about your career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I got serious about my career when I was graduating from my master's, sometime around January of 1999. It was the height of the World Wide Web. Between January of 1999 and the end of April, I had amassed about 14 offers in all kinds of different sectors: software engineering jobs at big companies, software engineering jobs at small companies, technology consulting, and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like to interview at Google?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ironically, Google used to be located in the building we are in now, on this floor. There was a conference room much like this one. It had a ping-pong table for entertainment, which was also used for the all-hands meeting. There were seven people the day I started, but an eighth person joined that same day. He came in to interview me and said, &lt;q&gt;I know I'm here to interview you, but I just started this morning, so I'm not really sure what to ask.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's interview format has changed a lot since then, but at the time I had to talk to everyone. I interviewed over two days, and, ironically, between those two days, another person had joined, and another person had also started moonlighting in the evenings—so I had two more people to talk to the next day! They were really growing quickly. They asked me some coding questions, some theoretical questions, and some systems design questions, but the vast majority of the questions focused on coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you leave with any impressions of Larry, Sergey, and Craig?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. I thought that Larry Page was very quiet. I thought that Sergey was deeply mathematical (which he is) because he quizzed me a lot on k-means clustering and different patterns that you might see if you actually mapped the values of what they meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt that Craig Silverstein—who is now one of my best friends—was one of the most brilliant people I'd ever met. A lot of my desire to go to Google was that I wanted to sit down and work alongside Craig and learn as much as I could. Obviously, when you join a startup, your ideals need to align with those of the founders. All three of them factored heavily into my decision to choose Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made Craig such a brilliant engineer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Craig is just a genius. He can speak in-depth on so many different subjects. And he's also the first to admit when he doesn't know a lot about something. He's just really, really sharp. I think he was pursuing a systems or theory-based Ph.D. at Stanford when he dropped out to help start Google with Larry and Sergey. People who work on systems and theory are generally just really terrific engineers. So I knew there was a lot that I could learn from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide to join Google? What was your decision making process like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had a long analytical evening with a friend of mine where we looked at all the job offers I had received. We created a giant matrix with one row per job offer and one column per value. We compared everything from the basics like cash and stock to where I'd be living, happiness factor, and trajectory factor—all of these different elements. And so we went to work analyzing this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At midnight my friend, Andre, who is brilliant—he had better than a 4.0 in Economics at Stanford—said, &lt;q&gt;You know Marissa, this has been totally fascinating, analyzing such a rich and interesting problem. Thank you so much for helping me work through this with you.&lt;/q&gt; And I sat back and just got really overwhelmed and was like, &lt;q&gt;I'm glad this was fun for you, but I still don't have an answer, and I don't know what I'm thinking. I told myself I'd make a decision by tomorrow. What am I going to do?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At which point he gave me the best piece of advice I've ever gotten. He said to me, &lt;q&gt;You know, I've looked at this problem for six hours with you. I understand it at least as well as you do. We've talked about every facet of each of these companies. But I have to tell you, I think you've approached the problem all wrong.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then he said, &lt;q&gt;You're looking at this as if there is one right answer among these fourteen, and thirteen wrong answers, but now that I've analyzed this with you, I can see that there are actually a bunch of good options here. There's just going to be one that you pick, and you commit to, and you won't look back at the others, and you'll make it great.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a common thing that very analytical people trip themselves up with. They look at things as if there's a right answer and a wrong answer when, the truth is, there's often just good choices, and maybe a great choice in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if there is a standout choice, you hope it stands out to you and you pick it. That's why you want to make sure that you really understand the space well and all the different elements of the different choices. But it's a trap to think that there's only one right or wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you value stock when you were thinking about Google?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I didn't actually think about the stock, I'll be honest. I knew that Larry and Sergey were fair, but for me, I valued the learning. I came to Google because some of the smartest people I'd ever met were working there including, Larry and Sergey and Craig. I also came to Google because I felt entirely unprepared to do what we were trying to do. They were talking about building a Fortune 500 company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the matrix we made, I had a “chance of success metric,” and I gave Google a 2% chance. However, I gave every other startup I was interviewing with a .02% chance. So, Google's chance of success was a hundred times better than any other startup I applied to—but still a one in fifty shot. Which is pretty good for a startup, but it's still far from assurance of success. And remember, at the time, it was a seven person company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did your estimation of Google's chance of success change at some point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It never felt assured. A lot of people feel that Google's success came overnight, but that's not the way it felt for me on the inside. It was very hard work, just back-breakingly hard work. Incredibly long hours. Incredibly stressful because we had this site we were keeping up. You would just chip away, and our traffic was constantly going up, and we were winning new users. But it didn't feel overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We definitely had milestones. It was a rich field for competition for accounts and contracts. We landed Yahoo, powering Yahoo search, and then powering AOL search as well. We would ask ourselves, &lt;q&gt;Oh gosh. What've we done? Now we actually have to build this and meet these timelines and these standards and these SLAs.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Were the contracts with Yahoo and AOL a turning point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those two contracts were also moments when we bit off a lot more than we could chew, and we really had to catch up. I remember when we made a huge revenue guarantee to AOL to get the account. We did a best-case scenario projection, a middle of the road projection, and a worst-case scenario projection. Worst-case scenario and middle of the road had us going out of business with the contract. The best-case scenario had us breaking even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out all of our models were wrong, but there was literally a moment when we signed a contract and realized, “in most likelihood, this contract breaks the company.” Ultimately, that was actually a great moment because we realized how much money we could make for AOL, that we could meet those guarantees, and that we could make even more money off our own site where we could keep 100%. We got a lot of insights from that contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could say, &lt;q&gt;Wasn't it great that you signed that contract and landed it?&lt;/q&gt; And it did turn out to be this major achievement, but the day we signed that contract was one of the scariest in the history of Google. When you're working at a startup, often the moments of major achievement are actually really scary ones. Those days aren't necessarily the ones you celebrate in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What differences did you notice between the engineering cultures at Yahoo and Google?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both companies had really strong engineering cultures. I would say that Google does some tech for technology's sake, and engineering is really the driving force there. When I arrived at Yahoo, I found that what we were building was driven more by marketing and sales and less by, say, product or engineering. At Yahoo, we worked hard to bring what we were building, and why we were building it, and how we were building it, back into the realm of tech and products. We actually changed the engineering culture quite a bit over those five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did having an engineering background help you as CEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, people knew that I had coded, and that gave me a lot of credibility when I got involved in critical technical discussions about how we were building things, or what particular products we needed to build. It helped with credibility and also helped me know what I was asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I was a good engineer. I was an even better product manager. And one of the reasons I was a good product manager was because I had been an engineer. So when I went to my engineers and said, &lt;q&gt;I need you to build this feature,&lt;/q&gt; or, &lt;q&gt;I think we should prioritize this,&lt;/q&gt; I actually knew what I was asking for. I knew if I was asking for something really hard that was going take a lot of re-architecting, and I knew if I was asking for something easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your advice for choosing between a big tech company and startup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would tell you to focus on what you're going to learn and the impact you can make. There are different scenarios at every company, but if you feel like you'll be part of a team with a lot of people who are smarter than you and better than you at a craft that you really care about, that's a great team to join. Also, if you're at a tiny company—you're one in five people, let's say—your impact is going to be pretty big. You have to make sure their mission is big, though. If the mission's big and the company is small, that's a great combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I had looked at McKinsey for consulting—which is a great company—but I had a lot of friends who were in analyst roles there, and I knew that as an analyst you would do all the work, and all the analysis, and prepare the presentation, but when it's time to actually make the decision, you're often asked to leave while the executives debate it. I felt that if I could be in the room when those decisions were being made—even if it was for some of the decisions and not all of them—I would learn a lot more. I felt that I would learn more trying to help the team at Google build a Fortune 500 company than I would giving advice to Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, if you're at a big company and there's a team that has a big mandate, but the team is small, that is also a great opportunity to progress your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the argument in favor of joining a startup less true today, now that big tech companies are increasing their compensation—especially for engineers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, yes, the value that engineers bring to companies is more recognized and rewarded now. At the same time, I still think that choosing a company is a lot more about your own learning and your own advancement and your own contribution than it is about compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that many people overweight compensation. The truth is, if you focus on what you can learn and what you can contribute and the impact you can make, you also usually get disproportionately rewarded in compensation, whether in the short term or in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you set career goals for yourself while you were at Google?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first two years, Google was a very flat organization. I guess they did actually have a career ladder, and I was moving up it, but we didn't get insight into that until later. When they actually digitized all the records, I was like, &lt;q&gt;Oh, it turns out I was getting all these promotions at the time, but I had no idea.&lt;/q&gt; Once they actually put the hierarchy in place, then it became really clear what the next step was, when it was time to make a move to director or a VP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a big advocate for having frank conversations once a year, outside of annual performance reviews. You don't want to exhaust your manager, but you want to know where you are and participate in planning with them. So, if you get your performance review in March, then have a straightforward conversation in, say, August or September: &lt;q&gt;Here's what I'm hoping to do. Here's what I think I can contribute. What are some of the steps you think I need to take, and things I need to fix, in order to make that step.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should someone decide whether to continue in engineering, or go into management?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's important for you to either pursue a management track or not based on your own proclivity. If you're deeply an introvert, if you don't enjoy leading, these are reasons why you should just try and become a very senior engineer without direct management of people. More and more companies are starting to open up avenues where you can become senior without managing people, and I think that's really freeing for people who really want to perfect their craft, who want to lead teams, but who don't necessarily want to be bogged down with managing and developing people. I think that it's important to have these two tracks. A lot of it is intrinsic personality traits that will draw you to one or the other and you need to listen to those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, leadership on a large scale, by its definition, requires managing and developing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our final question: Why isn't everyone happy all the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't know. Overall, I'm a pretty happy person, and one of my theories in life is that people fundamentally want to be happy. So, if you ever find a moment when you aren't happy, you should just wait. Something is likely to change in the scenario. Someone else will change what they're doing, or you'll get motivated to change what you're doing, so the situation will change overall for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marissa Mayer, thank you so much for your time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: A minimalist blog based on Tufte CSS</title>
<link>https://lawler.io</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lawler.io</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Or, how to build an anti-Medium.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two curiously-related pieces of content were shared on Hacker News today. The first was a short article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jrl.ninja/etc/1&quot;&gt;Joshua Li&lt;/a&gt;, explaining how a few basic CSS styles can make for a great-looking website—across varying devices. The second was a longer post by Marco Fioretti on how &lt;a href=&quot;http://stop.zona-m.net/2018/01/indeed-it-seems-that-google-is-forgetting-the-old-web/&quot;&gt;Google is “forgetting” the old web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter post kicked up the usual fierce debates &lt;label for=&quot;mn-seo&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-seo&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;…and people arguing about whether a search engine should actually return results matching what you type in.&lt;/span&gt; around whether the internet is still an open place if &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; gatekeeper determines whether you can find and read certain content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former article was berated for having too much CSS &lt;label for=&quot;mn-ornot&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-ornot&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;…or not enough CSS. Or not including styles for printers.&lt;/span&gt; or for using the CSS “rem” unit, instead of ems or pixels or vws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what really drew my eye was a comment from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19610271&quot;&gt;Marcus Holmes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, then, that hates the “narrow strip of text down the middle of my large monitor” school of web design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand why I’m being forced to scroll when there’s all this blank space to the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Marcus Holmes, comment on news.ycombinator.com&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great question, Marcus. &lt;label for=&quot;mn-actually&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-actually&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actually&lt;/em&gt;, it’s so I can use these sick side notes and margin notes! Thank you, Tufte CSS.&lt;/span&gt; Why &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; this website fill 100% of your 1080p or 4K monitor’s screen with text? There’s a very specific reason, and that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;text measure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A block of text or paragraph has a maximum line length that fits a determined design. If the lines are too short then the text becomes disjointed; if they are too long the content loses rhythm as the reader searches for the start of each line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Wikipedia entry on “Measure (typography)”, 2019&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;label for=&quot;mn-characters&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-characters&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;In both typography- and computer-speak, a &lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt; is an individual letter or typographic mark.&lt;/span&gt; optimal width of a paragraph of text is anywhere from 50–80 characters per line, depending on which of the many studies you cite. If a paragraph is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; wide, your eye loses its place when &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_in_reading#Saccades&quot;&gt;tracking back&lt;/a&gt; to the beginning of the next line. This decreases reading comprehension—and increases my irritation when I realize I’m re-reading the same line. 🤦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So what’s the point?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;label for=&quot;mn-firefox&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-firefox&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Firefox offers a “Reader” mode that will automatically constrain the page to the same ~68 character maximum width. Again, this is not a coincidence!&lt;/span&gt; this website, I chose a text measure that is approximately 70 characters wide, with average line widths of 65-68 characters. After your eye adjusts to the “constrained” width for reading long articles, Wikipedia begins to tire you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took several iterations to strike &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Eiriksmal/lawler-dot-io/commit/68f052e9bf8bbe9c835d3b6683d036971a1d6d82&quot;&gt;the right balance&lt;/a&gt; in this design between too-wide and too-narrow. &lt;label for=&quot;mn-duh&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-duh&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Given how many web typography dissertations I read in the course of refining this design, I shouldn’t have been surprised the professionals use consistent text measures—across publishers.&lt;/span&gt; My final measurement was to drag a bunch of books off the shelf, type out a line from each of them, and arrive at my own ideal width based on what the professionals chose. To my surprise, regardless of the book’s physical page sizes and typeface size, all of them were &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; 66 characters wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s this have to do with the other article?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fioretti article references a serious problem with the most-used search engine on the planet: It literally will not answer search results for sites that are “too old.” This could be a post written in 2007, or 2012. No one knows exactly how the Google algorithms rank and prune pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawler.io was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwern.net/About&quot;&gt;Gwern&lt;/a&gt;, a self-proclaimed “freelance writer &amp;amp; researcher who lives in Virginia.” He wrote something concerning his own website that runs deeply counter to the current online culture: Gwern.net is home to “stable long-term essays which improve over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stable, long-term&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key ingredient to Gwern’s website is his decision to use incredibly robust computer-y bits behind the scenes, to ensure his website isn’t going anywhere for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am not going to the same extremes as Gwern to keep lawler.io online for decades, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very appealing to create a simple, easy-to-maintain website that can persist for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot&quot;&gt;link rot&lt;/a&gt;, the phenomena that most of what goes on the internet disappear after a few weeks or months. Frankly, a lot of the content deserves to rot and disappear. The world has no need for another listicle of 13 Must-Know Viral Memes&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-believe&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;You won’t believe #7!&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first challenge is putting content on that website that &lt;em&gt;deserves&lt;/em&gt; to persist. The second, easier&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-easier&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Easier for this hacker-generalist CTO, at least.&lt;/span&gt; challenge, is keeping it online and living at the same web address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kaizen: Continuous improvement over time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists are paid to write articles. Buzzfeed-esque &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-buzz&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I’m going to use “Buzzfeed” as the Kleenex of “short web articles with outlandish titles and a splashy lead image to get people to click to open the article and share with all their friends but otherwise leave no impact on the ‘reader’ whatsoever.” I understand Buzzfeed News has “real” journalists now and does “serious” work. This does not change the impact they had on online content.&lt;/span&gt; listicles come from “content farms” that pay writers to… write. Your writing must hit certain key metrics or your paychecks will dry up. The most important metric? How many people open up your article, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incentivizes the creation of short articles that draw lots of clicks&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-engage&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;“Engagement” in social media marketing terms.&lt;/span&gt;, but don’t leave much of an impact on the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of content, it almost makes sense that Google would stop surfacing Buzzfeed articles from 2012. It wasn’t worth reading then and it &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; isn’t worth reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Medium.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium.com exploded in popularity because it, too, used to respect the typography rules we discussed above. &lt;label for=&quot;mn-now&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-now&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Today, it’s a bit too wide for my personal taste: ~77 characters&lt;/span&gt; It used simple black-ish text on a white-ish background. A straight-forward design that got out of your way and &lt;em&gt;let you read.&lt;/em&gt; And read we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Medium needed to make money. As more authors poured onto the site, as more companies chose to host their blogs on white-labeled Medium.com domains, Medium’s design evolved. Nowadays, it’s cluttered with crap. Here’s a screenshot of a “Recommended” article from tonight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lawler.io/images/2019/medium.com.png&quot; alt=&quot;Medium.com is a mess&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s cluttered with a huge call to action to join the website, a bunch of nav on the top, and a social widget that follows you down the page during the entire read. Of course, when you hit the bottom, the clutter maximizes with &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; call-to-actions, obligatory comment boxes&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-engagement&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Never forget your engagement KPIs.&lt;/span&gt; and other content you might want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I digress. The real thing that Medium.com has changed is expectations on what “long” content is. The pictured article has an impressive 5-minute reading estimate&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-squint&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Squint and you can see it under the author’s name and link to follow her writing on Medium.&lt;/span&gt;. Most of the content I see on Medium are 2-3 minute reads. Any more than that and you &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; risk losing readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that’s the second point in the quote I led off with. “I don’t understand why I’m being forced to scroll.” Though we can be assured Mr. Holmes is willing to scroll on a computer to read long articles, most of the people on the internet can’t be bothered. Buzzfeed knows this. Medium.com knows this, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is there another form of consumer? Is there a form of content on the internet that takes longer than 5 minutes to read? Is anyone writing longer articles that repulse the casual surfer, mindlessly flicking through links on their iPhone X? Apparently, such a fiend does exist! Quietly typing away, hundreds of individuals are crafting articles designed to be truly thought-provoking, to stand the test of time and Deserve To Be Read decades later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwern’s &lt;label for=&quot;mn-metoo&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-metoo&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;I, too, quietly tidy up these &lt;del&gt;humble&lt;/del&gt; scrivings, tightening them over time. Full edit histories, with explanatory commit messages, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Eiriksmal/lawler-dot-io/tree/main/content&quot;&gt;in GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for interested parties.&lt;/span&gt; taken this approach to the next level—he continuously updates his posts as he learns new information on the topic. His experiments will have periodic updates for years. Years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aspirations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aspiration is to create some substantive content that Deserves To Be Read. While this piece is certainly not one of them, it’s a start. A way of painfully filing off the rust from my long-neglected long-form writing skills. A way of unblocking writers block and getting the juices flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do these two articles have to do with one another? Simple: My website was designed to fit into both categories. An aesthetically-pleasing, easy-to-read website with no tracking codes. A home for long-form content that repulses article skimmers. A place for writing that Google will certainly ignore in 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Written April 02, 2019&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Filed under “&lt;a href=&quot;https://lawler.io/categories/business/&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;Business&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;23.121258633922&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;King of business books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; remains one of the best business books. Facts are true. Their truth does not change with the passage of time. No matter how our hairstyles evolve and computers continue to shrink, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;theory of constraints&lt;/a&gt; remains a powerful explanation for how work is accomplished. Very few business books have stood this same test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 years after his initial book was published, an anniversary edition was released containing praise from Kevin Behr, a co-author of &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-phoenix&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot; markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Mr. Behr’s book is an attempt to rewrite &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; for computer-y types—ditching the manufacturing setting for the dull vinyl flooring of a Fortune 1000 company’s IT department.&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; is my first recommendation for CIOs, CTOs and DevOps to better see What to Change, What to Change to and just How to Cause the Change. Thank you, Eli!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Kevin Behr, co-author of &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite taking more words to describe the same concepts, &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt; is landing on numerous “Top 10 Books Every New And Experienced Engineering Manager Should Read” listicles written in the past year. I heartily recommend every CTO or CIO read the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; dissertation on the Theory of Constraints before reading Mr. Behr’s less-useful, devops-heavy application of ToC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;65&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;del&gt;stuck at jury duty&lt;/del&gt; chosen to serve the lovely people of beautiful San Diego County, I took the following notes. &lt;label for=&quot;mn-meta&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-meta&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Anything in quotes is a direct quote. Everything else is my synthesis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;epigraph&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is meaningless unless you know what your goal is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Goldratt, 1984, p. 32&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building the foundation (pages 32-59)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to &lt;strong&gt;make money&lt;/strong&gt;. Profit, ROI, and cash flow measure this. Efficiencies, good people, high tech solutions, selling quality products, capturing market share, etc.—these merely &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; a company to make money, but should never be confused with The Goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net profit and a solid ROI is not enough to stay in business. Cash flow is vital—are we bringing in enough money to meet our expenses each month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE GOAL&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;label for=&quot;mn-thegoal&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-thegoal&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;All three must increase at the same time—no cheating for short-term pops in share price.&lt;/span&gt; “to make money by increasing net profit, while simultaneously increasing return on investment, while simultaneously increasing cash flow.” (page 49)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defining the terms (pages 60-75)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurements for daily operation of a manufacturing plant. &lt;label for=&quot;mn-expl&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-expl&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;Put another way, throughput is money coming in. Inventory is money circulating inside the system. Opex is money paid &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; to make that throughput money come &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; These are a form of expressing “The” Goal in terms a plant understands (Mr. Behr does something similar for IT work in &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt;). See if you can pick up the common element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make money, the value of the product—and the amount charged!—has to be greater than the combination of the investment in inventory and the total operational expense per &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt; unit. Units waiting to sell do not make you money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even buildings and machines are inventory&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-invest&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;When you see “investment”, think “inventory.”&lt;/span&gt;. You can depreciate part of them as opex, but whatever value is left can theoretically be sold as throughput. Making the machine…inventory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding flow (pages 80-101)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimming production capacity to precisely meet marketing demand is doomed to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dependent events and statistical fluctuations necessitate having a buffer on capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping everyone “busy” in a plant creates excessive inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical fluctuations are the possible range of time a task can take. If the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; time to solder a wire takes 4.3 minutes, but the range is 2.1 -&amp;gt; 6.4 minutes, no one can predict whether any individual wire will take 2.1 or 4.3 or even 7 minutes to complete&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-max&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Setting a new maximum time for soldering.&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Uh, sorry. This needs serious context, but is just for my personal recall.) Even with all the boys &lt;em&gt;walking&lt;/em&gt; the same speed, even minor &lt;em&gt;pauses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-pause&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;This is critical. Do you see? You have a bunch of kids walking the same speed, but they’re all randomly &lt;em&gt;pausing&lt;/em&gt; the “work,” causing the line to stretch out down the trail…😵&lt;/span&gt; to adjust backpacks creates additional length in the line. But the length can’t &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; because you can’t walk in front of the kid you’re following! Only the line leader has a pace that can be independently set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Dependency limits the opportunities for higher fluctuations. That can improve throughput.” (page 101)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughput is the rate at which the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; dependent event happens—not the first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Taking it to the real world (pages 110+)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;epigraph&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always run, never stop; the other option, having some workers idle, is taboo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Goldratt, 1984, p. 113&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local maxima are useless. &lt;label for=&quot;mn-morelater&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-morelater&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;(More to come as I finish digesting the final portion of the book)&lt;/span&gt; The &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; system must be optimized. All processing centers &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; have the same capacity. Downstream centers need &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; capacity to absorb the statistical fluctuations from upstream centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Curious what to read next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Cone, CTO of Radeus Labs &lt;label for=&quot;mn-ken&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;†&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mn-ken&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;CTO, co-owner, and lean manufacturing wizard!&lt;/span&gt;, encourages anyone interested in the ToC to turn to Dr. Goldratt’s followup, &lt;em&gt;Critical Chain&lt;/em&gt;. It provides a detailed explanation of the drum-buffer-rope methodology for controlling the flow of materials through bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like this kind of un-orthodox thinking, and are involved in software development, you should also read &lt;em&gt;Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business&lt;/em&gt; by David J. Anderson, inventor of the Kanban (capital K) agile software method. He takes a similarly counter-intuitive principle—limiting how many simultaneous tasks development teams can work on—and builds on it to create flexible solutions that scale from 2-man teams all the way up to Microsoft-levels of bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;15.40625&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning computer programming, it’s traditional to begin one’s journey towards mastering the syntax by instructing the computer to print &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History&quot;&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/a&gt; on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Python’s &lt;em&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ch&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is PHP’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Eiriksmal/gameboy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/em&gt; for the GameBoy&lt;/a&gt;, written in Z80 assembly, is an impressive 179 lines long—a sharp contrast to Python and PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the point?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brief missive is lawler.io’s &lt;em&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/em&gt;, if you will. In the weeks to come, this lonely piece of content will be joined by more meaningful thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is meaningless unless you know what your goal is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Eliahu M. Goldratt, &lt;cite&gt;The Goal&lt;/cite&gt; (1984), pg 32&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals for this website are straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow me to keep my writing skills sharp, lest they rust in the withering deluge of texts, emails, and social media lols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give me a space to better understand my own thoughts by typing them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve as a resource for others. When someone asks me for help, I can write a thoughtful response and throw it into the tangled snake of wires that is the world wide web—maybe some brave soul will stumble across the response and lessen their own pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s to a great 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
